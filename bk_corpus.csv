The court order forces a witness to appear to give testimony.  In a second day of Senate hearings, Brett Kavanaugh said no-one was above the law but he would not be drawn on what he called a hypothetical question.  He also declined to say if he thought presidents could pardon themselves. The BBC's Gary O'Donoghue, in Washington, says the investigation into alleged collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia in the 2016 election has raised important constitutional questions about the extent to which an incumbent president can be forced to co-operate.  Democrats are keen to push Mr Kavanaugh on the issue, he adds. Mr Kavanaugh, 53, who faces a four-day confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, was also pressed on his approach to gun rights and the law around abortion. He said he understood the importance of the precedent in the landmark 1973 case, Roe v Wade, which legalised abortion nationwide, pointing out it had been reaffirmed by the Supreme Court several times. If confirmed, the conservative appeals court judge would be expected to tilt the court's balance to the right.  Chuck Grassley, the Republican chairman of the Judiciary Committee, asked Mr Kavanaugh whether he would have any trouble ruling against the president who nominated him, to which he responded: ""No-one is above the law in our constitutional system."" ""I think the first quality of a good judge in our constitutional system is independence,"" he added. Senior Democrat Dianne Feinstein asked if he thought a sitting president could be ""required to respond to a subpoena"". ""I can't give you an answer on that hypothetical question,"" Mr Kavanaugh said. He gave a similar answer to Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy who asked whether a president could issue a pardon to himself or to someone else in exchange for promising not to testify against the president. In a tweet in June, President Trump said he had ""the absolute right to PARDON myself"". On abortion, Mr Kavanaugh said he understood people's strong feelings and he described Roe v Wade as ""an important precedent of the Supreme Court that has been reaffirmed many times"". Supporters of abortion rights fear Mr Kavanaugh could provide the decisive fifth vote on the nine-seat court to overturn the 1973 ruling. On the issue of gun rights, Senator Feinstein pressed Mr Kavanaugh on his previous opposition to a ban on semi-automatic rifles. Such weapons have been used in a string of deadly high school shootings. ""Of course the violence in the schools is something we all detest and want to do something about,"" Mr Kavanaugh said, but added that handguns and other semi-automatic weapons were also used for hunting and self-defence. For a second day, protesters interrupted proceedings before being removed by security personnel. On Tuesday, there were angry scenes minutes after Mr Kavanaugh entered the committee rooms. The hearing was disrupted by angry shouts from members of the public and lawmakers alike. Texas Republican John Cornyn said it was ""the first confirmation hearing for a Supreme Court justice I've seen basically according to mob rule"". The US Capitol Police said 61 people were removed from the committee room on Tuesday and arrested for disorderly conduct. Republicans have a slim majority in the 100-seat upper house. They can confirm Mr Kavanaugh if they stay united. So far, there are no signs of Republican defections.  Not all Democrats have said they will oppose Mr Kavanaugh, and several may even support his nomination.  The Senate is likely to vote on confirmation by the end of the month. The court begins its next term in October. He studied law at Yale and is a resident of the wealthy Washington suburb of Chevy Chase.  He worked under special counsel Kenneth Starr in his investigation into President Bill Clinton's relationship with intern Monica Lewinsky in the 1990s.  Under George W Bush, he served as deputy White House counsel and, from 2003-06, as Mr Bush's staff secretary.  A Catholic, he has been a US Court of Appeals judge in Washington for the past 11 years.  Theresa May says it is ""not acceptable"" for EU leaders to reject her plan without an alternative.

It follows an allegation of sexual assault in the 1980s against President Donald Trump's pick, Brett Kavanaugh. Mr Kavanaugh denies the allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford. Both say they are willing to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee. The panel's vote on Mr Kavanaugh is at present scheduled for Thursday. The Supreme Court often gives the final word on highly contentious laws and its nine judges have an immense impact on US political life. If chosen for the lifetime appointment, Mr Kavanaugh would be expected to tilt the court's balance to the right. Mr Kavanaugh was seen arriving at the White House on Monday morning, although the reason for the visit was unclear. President Trump told reporters at the White House on Monday: ""If it takes a little delay, it takes a little delay."" He added of Mr Kavanaugh: ""He is one of the great intellects and one of the finest people that anybody has known."" When asked whether the judge might withdraw from the confirmation process, the Republican president said: ""What a ridiculous question that is."" Calls have mounted for senators to postpone a vote on the nomination. Arizona Republican Senator Jeff Flake, who sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said Prof Ford's testimony should be heard.  ""We need to hear from her,"" he told news website Politico. ""And I don't think I'm alone in this."" Bob Corker, a Tennessee Republican, also said the vote should be delayed until Prof Ford was heard, while Lisa Murkowski told CNN a delay was something ""they might have to consider"". Without saying whether or not she would support a delay, Republican Susan Collins tweeted on Monday: ""Professor Ford and Judge Kavanaugh should both testify under oath before the Judiciary Committee."" The Republican chairman of the committee, Chuck Grassley, issued a statement without addressing any delay in the vote or testimony. He said Prof Ford ""deserves to be heard"" and that the matter should be covered in follow-up calls to both her and Mr Kavanaugh, which he said he was trying to set up. Mr Grassley criticised both the Democrats and Prof Ford's lawyer for not bringing the allegations to the committee earlier. The Democrats have demanded a delay. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said: ""Trying to rush this through on Thursday is an insult to the women of America and an insult to the majesty of the Supreme Court."" Democratic Party Senator Dick Durbin, who serves on the judiciary committee, said the burden had been put on the panel to ""get to the bottom"" of the matter. Senior Republican Senator John Cornyn called on lawmakers to treat the process ""with bipartisan participation in a spirit of collaboration and concern for all involved"". Both Prof Ford and Mr Kavanaugh said on Monday they would be willing to appear. Prof Ford's lawyer, Debra Katz, said: ""She's willing to do what she needs to do."" Ms Katz said Prof Ford had ""decided to take control of this and tell this in her own voice"". In a statement on Monday, Mr Kavanaugh again said the accusations against him were ""completely false"" and that he would ""refute"" them before the panel. He said: ""I have never done anything like what the accuser describes - to her or to anyone."" White House adviser Kellyanne Conway said Prof Ford should ""not be insulted or ignored"" and should testify under oath, although that would be up to the committee to decide. Christine Blasey Ford, a professor of psychology at Palo Alto University, detailed her allegations in the Washington Post at the weekend. She told the newspaper she believed the incident happened in 1982, when she was 15 and Mr Kavanaugh was 17.  She said Mr Kavanaugh and a friend had allegedly ""corralled"" her into a bedroom at a gathering. Mr Kavanaugh and his friend were both drunk, she says. The Washington Post reported her account as follows: ""While his friend watched, she said, Kavanaugh pinned her to a bed on her back and groped her over her clothes, grinding his body against hers and clumsily attempting to pull off her one-piece bathing suit and the clothing she wore over it.  ""When she tried to scream, she said, he put his hand over her mouth."" Mr Kavanaugh ""categorically and unequivocally"" denied the allegation last week.  Mark Judge, who has been named as the third person in the room, told The Weekly Standard the allegations were ""absolutely nuts"". Prof Ford spoke of the alleged attack a couple of times over the subsequent decades, including during therapy. Mr Trump's nomination of Mr Kavanaugh revived the pain of the memory, she said, prompting her to approach Democratic lawmakers with her allegations in July. Mr Kavanaugh, 53, was questioned during four days of hearings at the Senate Judiciary Committee last week, which are now complete.  The committee is due to vote on Thursday on whether his nomination should go forward to a full vote in the Senate.  The Republicans only have a single-vote majority on the committee, which they control 11 to 10, while they hold the Senate by just 51-49. Mr Kavanaugh is strongly opposed by some Democrats for his views on issues such as abortion, and it seems unlikely any of them will cross the aisle to vote with their Republican colleagues. This means it would take just Mr Flake to potentially derail Thursday's committee vote, while only two Republican defections would swing the outcome away from Mr Kavanaugh in the Senate. By Anthony Zurcher, BBC North America reporter This episode recalls another high-stakes confirmation battle more than 25 years ago, when then-judge Clarence Thomas faced sexual harassment allegations during his Supreme Court hearings. Mr Thomas prevailed, but the ordeal left both sides bruised and bitter, and may have contributed to the surge in women elected to Congress in 1992. Now history seemingly repeats itself, this time in the shadow of the #MeToo movement. With the disposition of the Supreme Court for a generation in the balance, and mid-term congressional elections less than two months away, the stakes couldn't be higher.

Reports say an unidentified woman claimed in a letter to Democrats that Mr Kavanaugh tried to force himself on her at a party in the early 1980s. Senate Democrats on Thursday disclosed that they had referred a complaint to federal investigators. The judge faces a confirmation vote to join the Supreme Court next week. In a statement on Friday, the appeals court judge said: ""I categorically and unequivocally deny this allegation. I did not do this back in high school or at any time."" The alleged incident took place when Mr Kavanaugh was a minor and student at Georgetown Preparatory School in Bethesda, Maryland. The woman - who asked not to be identified - was also a minor and a student at a nearby high school. Her letter alleges the now judge held her down and covered her mouth with his hand.  They were in a room with a classmate of Mr Kavanaugh's, and both boys had been drinking, before turning up the music to muffle her sound of protests, she alleges. The woman was able to free herself, the New Yorker said.  Although the alleged incident was decades ago, the woman said the memory had caused ongoing distress and she had sought psychological treatment. The woman first approached Democratic lawmakers in July, shortly after Mr Trump's nomination of him revived the pain of the memory, US media said.  She reportedly sent a letter to her local congresswoman, Democrat Anna Eshoo, and Senator Dianne Feinstein, the committee's top Democrat. Ms Feinstein said the woman ""strongly requested confidentiality, declined to come forward or press the matter further, and I have honoured that decision"".  ""I have, however, referred the matter to federal investigative authorities,"" she said Thursday. Anonymous sources, including a Democratic aide, confirmed to the Associated Press the allegation is of a sexual nature. Mr Kavanaugh is a controversial pick for replacing Justice Anthony Kennedy and he is strongly opposed by some Democrats for his views, such as on abortion. The 53-year-old was questioned during four days of hearings with the Senate Judiciary Committee last week.

Christine Blasey Ford's attorney told CNN her client has been ""deflecting death threats and harassment"". Lawyer Lisa Banks said before her client goes to Congress, she wants an FBI investigation into Judge Kavanaugh. The nominee, who denies the claim, has met officials at the White House for a second day. Prof Ford, a psychology lecturer in California, has accused Judge Kavanaugh of drunkenly trying to remove her clothing in 1982 when they were both teenagers in a Washington DC suburb.  She says he pinned her to a bed and clamped his hand over her mouth when she attempted to scream. Judge Kavanaugh, 53, has called the allegation ""completely false"". Prof Ford's legal team say they have written to the Senate Judiciary Committee declining its offer to testify. Her lawyer told CNN on Tuesday night: ""It's premature to talk about a hearing on Monday because she [Prof Ford] has been dealing with the threats, the harassment and the safety of her family and that's what she's been focused on for the last couple of days."" She said that since going public with her allegation in the Washington Post on Sunday, Prof Ford has been trying to work out where her family are going to sleep at night. The legal team's letter says that Prof Ford's family has been forced to move out of their home, her email has been hacked and she has been impersonated online. The correspondence says ""a full investigation by law enforcement officials will ensure that the crucial facts and witnesses in this matter are assessed in a non-partisan manner, and that the Committee is fully informed before conducting any hearing or making any decisions"". Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley later said that there was no reason to delay Prof Ford's testimony as the aim would be to establish ""her personal knowledge and memory of events"". ""Nothing the FBI or any other investigator does would have any bearing on what Dr Ford tells the committee,"" he said in a statement. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, of South Carolina, said that if Prof Ford did not appear to testify on Monday, ""we are going to move on and vote [on the nominee for the Supreme Court] on Wednesday"". ""They've had tons of time to do this,"" he said, adding: ""This has been a drive-by shooting when it comes to Kavanaugh, I'll listen to the lady, but we're going to bring this to a close."" Senator Rob Portman, a Republican from Ohio, said the process was ""very unfair"" and that he did not blame Prof Ford, instead blaming ""Democrats who misused this process"".  Chuck Schumer, the top Senate Democrat, said he supported the call for an FBI investigation prior to the hearing.  In a statement he urged Senate Republicans and the White House to ""drop their inexplicable opposition"" to it and ""allow all facts to come out"".  Hawaii Democrat Mazie Hirono said ""the men in this country"" should ""just shut up"".  ""Not only do women like Dr Ford, who bravely comes forward, need to be heard, but they need to be believed,"" she told a press conference. Separately, the FBI declined to comment after the letter was made public on Tuesday. US President Donald Trump, who reportedly did not meet Mr Kavanaugh on Tuesday, expressed sympathy for his nominee. ""I feel so badly for him that he's going through this, to be honest with you,"" the Republican president told a news conference. ""This is not a man that deserves this."" He added: ""Hopefully the woman will come forward, state her case. He will state his case before representatives of the United States Senate. And then they will vote."" Mr Trump also appeared to suggest that the controversy was being exploited by Democrats as lawmakers looked to delay the Supreme Court vote.  ""The Supreme Court is one of the main reasons I got elected President. I hope Republican voters, and others, are watching, and studying, the Democrats Playbook,"" he tweeted. Meanwhile Mark Judge, a friend of Judge Kavanaugh who Prof Ford says witnessed the alleged incident, has said he does not want to speak publicly about the matter. ""Brett Kavanaugh and I were friends in high school but I do not recall the party described in Dr Ford's letter,"" he is quoted as saying in a letter from his lawyer. Republicans control the Senate by only a narrow 51-49 margin, meaning any defections could scupper the Supreme Court nomination. That would set back President Trump's efforts to install more conservatives on the Supreme Court and broader US judiciary. If confirmed, Judge Kavanaugh, a conservative federal appeals court judge, would be expected to tilt the court's balance further to the right. The ugly confirmation battle could shake up the forthcoming mid-term elections. Democrats are hoping to wrest control of Congress from Mr Trump's fellow Republicans on 6 November, dealing a serious blow to the president's efforts to install more conservatives on the Supreme Court and broader US judiciary.

 Brett Kavanaugh, Donald Trumpâs conservative nominee for the US supreme court, faced sharp questions on Capitol Hill on some of the hottest issues raging in American society â abortion, gun rights and presidential power â during the second day of his dramatic confirmation hearing. Amid hours of intense questioning on Wednesday, Kavanaugh declined to say how he would rule if the supreme court were to once again weigh the legality of abortion and similarly dodged on whether the president has the authority to pardon himself. The atmosphere was a little calmer, after the opening day on Tuesday quickly became a cacophony of yelling protesters incensed at the choice of Kavanaugh and repeated interruptions by Democratic senators angry at the late disclosure of documents by the White House about the judgeâs track record. But demonstrations continued inside the US Senate building on Wednesday, with occasional outbursts from protesters, such as: âSham president, sham justice!â and âNo Trump puppet!â As members of Congress weighed his suitability for Americaâs top judicial bench, Kavanaugh said he understood âthe significanceâ of Roe v Wade, the landmark 1973 supreme court decision that legalized abortion in the US. But he declined to respond when asked if he would make a commitment against overturning the law. He also successfully dodged the question of whether a president must respond to a subpoena â neatly sidestepping an intensely contested topic against the backdrop of special counsel Robert Muellerâs investigation into potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Moscow. The wide-ranging testimony underscored the potential for Kavanaughâs nomination to shape the supreme court and the decisions before it for decades to come. Kavanaugh, a federal appeals judge, was nominated by Trump in July to replace the retiring justice Anthony Kennedy, who had been a critical swing vote on the nine-member bench. Kennedy had a track record of siding with the more liberal justices on the bench on some decisions, the more conservative wing on others. Kavanaugh is expected to push the court to the right. On Wednesday, members of the Senate committee were granted up to 30 minutes each to grill Kavanaugh on a variety of subjects. But he remained vague on what his approach would be to several issues at the forefront of his nomination. Chief among them was his views on abortion amid concerns that Kavanaughâs confirmation will all but ensure an end to legal abortion across the US, long a goal of ultra-conservatives. But in the hearing Kavanaugh mostly stuck to reciting the facts of the case without disclosing his own legal view. âI understand the importance of the precedent set forth in Roe v Wade,â he said. âIt has been reaffirmed many times over the past 45 years.â Asked directly by Dianne Feinstein, the Democratic senator from California, for his position on a womanâs right to choose, Kavanaugh again cited legal precedent, while adding: âI understand how passionately and deeply people feel about the issue. I donât live in a bubble. I live in the real world.â Kavanaughâs comments will do little to pacify skeptics, who have cited his opposition to a court ruling last year that an undocumented immigrant teenager who was in government custody was entitled to seek an abortion. Pressed on the case in Wednesdayâs hearing, Kavanaugh said he was following his interpretation of parental consent provisions in the law. (The teen followed state law, obtaining permission to seek an abortion from a judge in the absence of parental consent.) ""I'm a judge, I'm not making the policy decision,â Kavanaugh said. On Twitter, Hillary Clinton urged her followers to join the pressure campaign against Kavanaugh by calling their senators. âIf Brett Kavanaugh becomes a supreme court justice, will he help gut or overturn Roe v Wade, which legalized abortion in America? Yes, of course he will,â the former presidential nominee tweeted. In another consequential exchange, Kavanaugh would not say if a president was legally obligated to comply with a subpoena. âI canât give you an answer on that hypothetical question,â he said. The question, posed by Feinstein, was an unmistakable reference to the legal challenges facing Trump. The presidentâs repeated efforts to undermine the Russia investigation â and threats to dismiss the special counsel â have amplified the potential for the matter to eventually reach the courts. Senator Patrick Leahy, a Democrat from Vermont, asked Kavanaugh point blank if presidents have the âabsolute rightâ to pardon themselves. The judge once again demurred. âThe question of self-pardons is something I've never analyzed,â Kavanaugh said. âIt's a hypothetical question that I can't begin to answer in this context.â Kavanaugh also described US v Nixon, the supreme court ruling that ordered then President Richard Nixon to turn over secret White House recordings toward the end of the Watergate investigation, as âone of the greatest moments in American judicial historyâ. He had previously signaled it may have been wrongly decided. Democrats have raised concerns that if the special counsel investigation were to make its way to the supreme court, Kavanaugh could not be impartial toward the president who appointed him. Kavanaugh insisted the White House was subject to the law, but left Democrats on the panel frustrated over his refusal to say where, exactly, the presidentâs authority might be limited. Kavanaugh would not comment on whether a president could fire the special counsel investigating him and said it was up to Congress to determine what would constitute an impeachable offense. He did, however, push back on the notion that he would be loyal to Trump. ""If confirmed to the Supreme Court and as a sitting judge, I owe my loyalty to the Constitution,"" Kavanaugh said, while holding up a personal copy of the legal document. The Republicans have a razor-thin majority in the Senate but are nevertheless expected to have the votes to confirm Kavanaugh before the midterm elections in November. The confirmation hearing for Donald Trump's pick for the supreme court has been a tumultuous affair",0.038,0.846,0.115,0.9976,0.42055555555555546

Judge Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who says he attacked her more than three decades ago, will both be able to testify. US President Donald Trump said earlier he expected ""a little delay"" to confirming his nominee. Judge Kavanaugh, 53, says the allegation is ""completely false"". He denies he was even at the 1982 high school party in question where his accuser, now a psychology professor in California, says he tried to rape her as his friend watched. The claim has jeopardised Judge Kavanaugh's formerly all-but certain-nomination for a lifetime job on the Supreme Court. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley confirmed next Monday's hearing in a statement. ""As I said earlier, anyone who comes forward as Dr Ford has done deserves to be heard,"" said the Iowa Republican. Mr Grassley had earlier stopped short of calling for a public hearing, or for delaying the committee's vote on the nominee. The judge last week finished four days of hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee, and a vote on his confirmation had been planned for Thursday of this week. But Democrats demanded a delay in the vote in order to let the FBI investigate. Mr Grassley said the standard procedure would be for committee members to conduct telephone calls with both witnesses about their forthcoming testimony. But in a statement, the panel's Democrats refused to join in any phone call with Judge Kavanaugh. Senators from both parties had argued that Judge Kavanaugh and Prof Ford should be given the chance to testify before the panel. Senator Susan Collins, a Maine Republican, told reporters she would like the chance to observe Prof Ford to decide the credibility of her account. ""Obviously, if Judge Kavanaugh has lied about what happened, that would be disqualifying,"" she said. Two other Republican senators, Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona, and Bob Corker of Tennessee, earlier called for the vote to be delayed. Prof Ford detailed her story in a letter sent to Senate Judiciary Committee senior Democrat Dianne Feinstein in July before going public in an article published in the Washington Post on Sunday. The Palo Alto University academic says the incident happened 36 years ago in a Maryland suburb outside Washington DC. Prof Ford says Brett Kavanaugh pinned her to a bed and tried to take off her clothes, then clamped his hand over her mouth when she attempted to scream. They were students in different high schools. She was 15 and he was 17. Both he and his friend, who allegedly watched the incident, were drunk, she says. Mark Judge, who has been named as the third person in the room, told The Weekly Standard the allegations were ""absolutely nuts"". Prof Ford says she spoke of the alleged attack a couple of times over the subsequent decades, including during therapy. In a statement on Monday, Judge Kavanaugh vowed to ""refute"" the accusation before the congressional panel. He said in a statement issued by the White House: ""I have never done anything like what the accuser describes - to her or to anyone. ""Because this never happened, I had no idea who was making this accusation until she identified herself yesterday."" Prof Ford's lawyer, Debra Katz, told NBC's Today programme on Monday that ""if it were not for the severe intoxication of Brett Kavanaugh, she [Prof Ford] would have been raped"". Republicans control the Senate by only a narrow 51-49 margin, meaning any defections could scupper the nomination. That would set back President Trump's efforts to install more conservatives on the Supreme Court and broader US judiciary. If confirmed, Judge Kavanaugh, a conservative federal appeals court judge, would be expected to tilt the court's balance further to the right. The confirmation fight comes just weeks before November's congressional elections in which Democrats are hoping to wrest control of Congress from Mr Trump's party. The Judicial Crisis Network, a conservative group that backs Mr Trump's judicial picks, says it plans to launch a $1.5m (Â£1.1m) ad campaign backing Judge Kavanaugh. Mr Trump, who faces multiple accusations of sexual misconduct that surfaced during the 2016 presidential election campaign, has not offered an opinion on the credibility of Prof Ford's allegation. At the White House on Monday, the Republican president said of the confirmation: ""If it takes a little delay, it will take a little delay."" He dismissed as ""ridiculous"" a reporter's question about whether Judge Kavanaugh's nomination would be withdrawn. ""I think he's very much on track,"" Mr Trump said. The White House said in a statement: ""Judge Kavanaugh looks forward to a hearing where he can clear his name of this false allegation."" Theresa May says it is ""not acceptable"" for EU leaders to reject her plan without an alternative.

Susan Collins says Brett Kavanaugh told her that he considers Roe v. Wade ""settled law.""Reuters  President Donald Trump's Supreme Court pick Brett Kavanaugh believes the landmark Roe v. Wade ruling that legalized abortion is settled law, according to Senator Susan Collins.   Collins, a Republican, spoke to reporters after meeting with Kavanaugh in her office for two hours on Tuesday.   ""We talked about whether he considered Roe to be settled law. He said that he agreed with what Justice Roberts said at his nomination hearing, in which he said that it was settled law,"" she said. Settled law refers to a legal position that has been consistently upheld by judges.   Trump nominated Kavanaugh, 53, on July 9 to replace retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy. Before Kavanaugh can assume the lifetime job on the nine-member court, the Republican-controlled Senate must vote to confirm him.   During his presidential campaign, Trump promised to appoint ""pro-life justices"" who would overturn Roe v. Wade, the 1973 ruling that legalized abortion nationwide. Speculation has centered on whether Kavanaugh, a federal appeals court judge with a solidly conservative judicial record, would vote to overturn a woman's right to abortion.   Kavanaugh's judicial record on abortion is thin, although last year he was on a panel of judges that issued an order preventing a 17-year-old illegal immigrant detained in Texas by US authorities from immediately obtaining an abortion.  Collins previously said she would not support a Supreme Court nominee who expressed ""hostility"" towards Roe v. Wade.Reuters  Collins, a moderate Republican, has said she could not support a nominee who had demonstrated ""hostility"" to Roe V. Wade. She is considered a key vote in the confirmation process, but she said Tuesday she will not make a decision until after Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings, which start on September 4.   ""I have always waited until after the judiciary committee hearings before rendering a final decision on a Supreme Court nominee,"" Collins said. ""You never know what questions are going to come up.""                                                                                                           She is considered one of two potential swing votes, along with Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, who also supports abortion rights. Kavanaugh is expected to meet with Murkowski later this month.   Collins said her conversation with Kavanaugh covered a wide range of issues, including abortion, guns, and Kavanaugh's ""judicial philosophy."" She called the meeting helpful, productive, and informative.   Kavanaugh's confirmation will require a simple majority in the 100-seat Senate, where Republicans hold a 51-49 edge over Democrats and independents. Sen. John McCain, a Republican, is at home undergoing treatment for cancer, leaving Republicans no room for error if no Democrats support Kavanaugh. Vice President Mike Pence would vote if there is a tie.   But conservatives are pressuring several Senate Democrats running for re-election in states that Trump won in 2016 to vote for Kavanaugh. Three Democrats voted to confirm Trump's previous Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch.   Also on Tuesday, several female Democratic senators met with women's health advocates to talk about what is at stake with Kavanaugh's nomination.

Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey asked Kavanaugh whether he would recuse himself from a case involving the special counsel Robert Mueller or the Russia probe if the nation's high court takes up the matter.   The issue has been on the minds of Democratic senators who have expressed concerns about Kavanaugh's views on executive branch powers. The Supreme Court could weigh in on  a number of potential scenarios that could play out in the Russia probe or the obstruction of justice case involving Trump in the near term.   ""Even at the jeopardy of President Trump pulling back your nomination, why not now alleviate all of that suspicion that a reasonable person might have?"" Booker asked Kavanaugh.   Kavanaugh chose not to take a position on recusal because, in his view, making such a decision beforehand would jeopardize the impartiality of the court.   Notably, the US attorney general Jeff Sessions recused himself from the Russia probe in March 2017, citing his previous contacts with Russian officials during the 2016 election.   Kavanaugh demurred on the issue: ""If I committed to deciding a particular case ... all I would be doing is demonstrating that I don't have the independence of the judiciary. That is necessary to be a good judge.""   The Supreme Court nominee had a similar response to California Sen. Kamala Harris, who asked him on Thursday to address concerns about his ability to remain impartial in judicial matters related to Trump. To that, Kavanaugh insisted that his record as a judge speaks for him.   ""My independence, I believe, has been demonstrated by my 12-year record,"" Kavanaugh said. He repeated that he firmly adheres to those principles.                                                                                                                       When Harris took up the recusal question Sen. Booker asked previously, Kavanaugh said, ""the independence of the judiciary requires that I not commit"" to participating or not participating in a case.   Harris and Kavanaugh crossed swords one day earlier  when she cornered him on a question about whether he had spoken about the Russia probe or Mueller with anyone at the law firm of Trump's personal lawyer, Marc Kasowitz.

But after two marathon days in the witness chair in a Senate hearing room, Kavanaugh appeared to be on a path to confirmation as a Supreme Court justice.   The 53-year-old appellate judge stuck to a well-rehearsed script throughout his testimony, providing only glimpses of his judicial stances while avoiding any serious mistakes that might jeopardize his confirmation. In what almost seemed like a celebration Thursday, Kavanaugh's two daughters returned to the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing room for the final hours of testimony, accompanied by teammates on Catholic school basketball teams their father has coached.   Senators will return for a final hearing day on Friday along with more than two dozen witnesses on both sides of the nomination fight. Democratic witnesses include John Dean, Richard Nixon's White House counsel who cooperated with prosecutors during the Watergate investigation, and Rochelle Garza, the legal guardian for the pregnant immigrant teenager whose quest for an abortion Kavanaugh would have delayed last year.   On the Republican side, former solicitors general Theodore Olson and Paul Clement will testify in support of the nominee, along with former students, law clerks and the mother of a basketball player Kavanaugh coached.   Campaigning in Montana Thursday night, Trump sought to elevate Kavanaugh's confirmation as a political litmus test for voters, saying the judge deserves bipartisan support and criticizing the ""anger and the meanness on the other side — it's sick.""   Abortion was a focus throughout Kavanaugh's two days of testimony. The Democrats' best shot at stopping Kavanaugh — who could swing the court further to the right for decades — would be branding him as a justice who might vote to overturn the court's landmark Roe v. Wade ruling. Their hope is that two Republican senators who support abortion rights could break from their party and vote against him.   A newly disclosed email suggested Kavanaugh once indicated the abortion case was not settled law, though Kavanaugh denied in the hearing that he had been expressing his personal views.   The tone in the email from 2003 contrasted with his responses to questions on Wednesday when he stressed how difficult it is to overturn precedents like Roe. In the email, Kavanaugh was reviewing a potential op-ed article in support of two judicial nominees while he was working at the George W. Bush White House. The document had been held by the committee as confidential, but was made public Thursday.   ""I am not sure that all legal scholars refer to Roe as the settled law of the land at the Supreme Court level since Court can always overrule its precedent, and three current Justices on the Court would do so,"" Kavanaugh wrote, referring to justices at the time, in an email to a Republican Senate aide. The document was partially redacted.                                                               Asked about it by the committee's top Democrat, Dianne Feinstein of California, Kavanaugh reiterated his previous testimony that ""Roe v. Wade is an important precedent of the Supreme Court.""   Democrats also questioned Kavanaugh's ability to separate himself from Trump and special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation of Russia's meddling in the 2016 election. Throughout his testimony, Kavanaugh repeatedly stated the importance of judicial independence.   Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois put the focus on Trump, who Durbin said, ""has shown contempt for the federal judiciary and has shown disrespect for the rule of law over and over again.""   ""It's in the context of the Trump presidency that we ask you these questions,"" Durbin said.   Kavanaugh refused to answer questions about Trump or commit to stepping aside from any case about the Russia investigation that might come to the Supreme Court. When Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut invited him to denounce Trump's criticism of federal judges, including Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the nominee demurred.                                                               ""The way we stand up is by deciding cases and controversies independently without fear or favor,"" Kavanaugh said.   Earlier, he said his 12-year record as an appellate judge shows that he has not been afraid to invalidate executive branch actions. Kavanaugh said that he has made clear that a court order ""that requires a president to do something or prohibits a president from doing something ... is the final word in our system.""   On a separate track, Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont and Durbin led the charge in suggesting that Kavanaugh misled them in earlier testimony. He denied that allegation with the robust support of Senate Republicans.   Much of the debate among senators focused more on the disclosure of documents than on Kavanaugh's record. Democratic Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey — who along with Harris is a potential presidential candidate in 2020 — said he was willing to risk fallout over releasing confidential documents about Kavanaugh's views on race. Republican John Cornyn of Texas warned him that senators could be expelled for violating confidentially rules. Democrats and Booker responded, ""Bring it on.""   In fact, some of the documents the Democrats wanted disclosed had been released hours earlier, in a pre-dawn disclosure approved by Bill Burck, the GOP attorney who serves as presidential records lawyer for Bush.                                                               The document battle stemmed from Kavanaugh's unusually long paper trail following his years in the Bush White House. The panel's process resulted in hundreds of thousands of pages of Kavanaugh's documents being withheld as confidential or kept from release under presidential privilege by the Trump White House.   Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, who released more documents Thursday, stood by his handling of the issue.   ""My process was fair,"" Grassley declared.

When Kavanaugh's accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, a 51-year-old research psychologist,  came forward over the weekend, it sent the Senate committee tasked with vetting Kavanaugh's nomination into a tailspin. Ford, who identified herself to The Washington Post in an article published Sunday, says that at a party in the early 1980s, Kavanaugh pinned her to a bed and groped her while his friend watched.   All 10 of the Judiciary Committee's Democrats  signed a letter to its Republican chairman, Sen. Chuck Grassley, asking to delay the Thursday vote on whether to shepherd Kavanaugh out of the committee. Later Monday morning, Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, one of the few Republicans undecided on whether to confirm Kavanaugh, called for both Kavanaugh and Ford to testify under oath before the committee.   Those moves, coupled with calls for delaying the vote by retiring GOP Sens. Bob Corker and Jeff Flake, mean that what Republicans thought would be a swift confirmation is now hanging by a thread.   Grassley said in a statement Monday afternoon that he was attempting to work with Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, to establish follow-up calls, but that Feinstein's office was refusing to comply.   ""The standard procedure for updates to any nominee's background investigation file is to conduct separate follow-up calls with relevant parties,"" Grassley said. ""In this case, that would entail phone calls with at least Judge Kavanaugh and Dr. Ford. Consistent with that practice, I asked Senator Feinstein's office yesterday to join me in scheduling these follow-ups. Thus far, they have refused. But as a necessary step in evaluating these claims, I'll continue working to set them up.""   Grassley also chastised Democrats, saying Republicans were kept in the dark about a letter Ford sent to Feinstein via Rep. Anna Eshoo of California earlier this summer detailing her allegation.   ""Unfortunately, committee Republicans have only known this person's identity from news reports for less than 24 hours and known about her allegations for less than a week,"" Grassley added. ""Senator Feinstein, on the other hand, has had this information for many weeks and deprived her colleagues of the information necessary to do our jobs. The Minority withheld even the anonymous allegations for six weeks, only to later decide that they were serious enough to investigate on the eve of the committee vote, after the vetting process had been completed.""   The more Republicans start to call for a delayed vote, the more likely it is to happen, as the GOP's Senate majority is slim.                                                                                                                                                                                   Republicans are also concerned about what action the White House might take. There is an expectation among GOP aides that Trump will go after Ford for accusing Kavanaugh of sexual assault. If Trump were to do so, it could make things even more difficult for Republicans.   Regardless, the White House is standing by Kavanaugh, who has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.   ""We want to go through a full process ... and hear everybody out,"" Trump told reporters on Monday, describing Kavanaugh as ""one of the great intellects and one of the finest people.""   Asked whether Kavanaugh had offered to withdraw, Trump replied, ""What a ridiculous question.""   ""This is a completely false allegation,"" Kavanaugh said in a statement Monday morning. ""I have never done anything like what the accuser describes — to her or to anyone.""                                                                                                                                                                                   Kavanaugh also said he would be willing to cooperate with the Judiciary Committee on any additional material or testimony it might want from him.   ""Because this never happened, I had no idea who was making this accusation until she identified herself yesterday,"" he added. ""I am willing to talk to the Senate Judiciary Committee in any way the Committee deems appropriate to refute this false allegation, from 36 years ago, and defend my integrity.""   On Monday,  CNN reported that Kavanaugh had hired Beth Wilkinson, an attorney from Wilkinson Walsh Eskovitz, a prominent firm in Washington, DC. Ford is being represented by Debra Katz, who has specialized in sexual-misconduct cases.   Meanwhile, conservative activist groups are rallying around Kavanaugh's defense. The Judicial Crisis Network announced on Monday that it would launch a $1.5 million ad campaign to combat what it called attacks on Kavanaugh's character.

As Kavanaugh sat silently with his family behind him, Democratic senators protested a lack of time to review the nominee’s voluminous records from his time in the George W. Bush Administration, the withholding of certain documents under executive privilege and the speed with which the committee was moving on confirmation. “We are rushing through this process in a way that is unnecessary,” said Democratic Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey. He and other senators spoke out of turn, as protesters with the liberal group Code Pink periodically jumped up and began shouting, leading to a chaotic opening to a week of hearings. “We stand for reproductive rights,” yelled one protester. “Please vote no!” yelled another. “An illegitimate president cannot make a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court,” yelled a third. Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley hadn’t even finished his opening statement as order in the hearing broke down. Right before Grassley was slated to deliver it, the majority of Democrats on the committee, with the exception of ranking member Dianne Feinstein, moved to adjourn the hearing, arguing that the documents from Kavanaugh’s time in the Bush White House that the Senate had received Monday night was a cause for delay. Feinstein expressed her displeasure with the hearings in her opening statement but stayed out of the procedural fray. As the Democrats on the committee were making their requests, members of the public watching the hearing in the back of the room were voicing their own opposition and being led away. At least 15 protests interrupted the hearing during the first 45 minutes. One code pink protester held up a sign, that read “ROE- YES KAVANA-NOPE,” a reference to the 1973 landmark Supreme Court decision Roe v. Wade that upheld a woman’s constitutional right to an abortion. The entire time this was happening, Kavanaugh sat silently in the middle of the room, watching both senators and spectators denounce his nomination. As Grassley repeatedly tried to read his opening statement, Democrats again brought up their desire to adjourn the hearing. Grassley let them speak, but warned their efforts would ultimately be futile. “We’re going to not necessarily accommodate all obstruction, but if people have got something to say, this chairman is going to let them say it,” Grassley said. “But its pretty boring to hear the same thing all the time.” An hour and fifteen minutes after the hearing started, he was finally able to give his opening statement uninterrupted.",0.064,0.878,0.058,0.5982,0.4353510474200129

 Late-night hosts arrived back after a vacation to discuss the Nike controversy, supreme court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Bob Woodwardâs new book on Donald Trump. On Jimmy Kimmel Live! the host spoke about how people are ripping the Nike logo from socks. âFinally something dumber than eating Tide pods,â he remarked. He continued: âItâs a powerful statement that says: âI have too many socks.ââ Itâs the latest protest from Trump supporters against a company and Kimmel went on to sum them all up. âItâs kind of hilarious if you think about it,â he sais. âAll of these guys who voted for Trump, now they canât watch the NFL, they canât ride Harleys, they have to burn their Nikes, they canât go to Starbucks or watch Netflix, they have to love Vladimir Putin and hate the FBI â¦ I mean, if this was a practical joke, it would be one of the greatest practical jokes of all time.â He added: âWhy not just burn your money? You already bought the clothes.â On The Late Show, Stephen Colbert referred to events in the White House as âhistorically crazy stuffâ before commenting that his initial wish to discuss what happened over the last fortnight in detail was curtailed at the last minute. âIt seems like an explosive book about the Trump White House comes out every few minutes,â he said in reference to Bob Woodwardâs new book, Fear. Colbert joked that it is âa book named after the emotion Trump feels after he sees a bookâ. In Woodwardâs exposÃ©, he reveals many shocking details about Trumpâs presidency, including his repeated jabs at the attorney general, Jeff Sessions, who he apparently called a âdumb southernerâ. âNot all southerners are dumb, just the ones willing to work for you,â Colbert said. On Late Night with Seth Meyers, the host spoke about the problematic nature of a president who is under investigation then trying to confirm a new supreme court justice. âItâs like Bonnie getting arrested and saying: âYou know whoâd make a great judge? Clyde,ââ he joked. Meyers also spoke about Trumpâs attack on Sessions but this time referring to a tweet that criticized how two Republican candidates remain under investigation, blaming it on him. Trump tweeted that the Democrats must now love him for what he is doing. âFirst of all, no one loves Jeff Sessions,â Meyers said. âHe looks like a haunted doll that moves whenever you look away.â Meyers continued to go into detail about how Brett Kavanaugh is being presented by both rightwing pundits and Republicans as a carpool dad. âAnyone can drive a car!â he said. âRepublicans are rushing to confirm the supreme court nominee of a president under criminal investigation whoâs trying to subvert the justice system to his own political ends so they can roll back voting rights, reproductive rights and workersâ rights to solidify their grip on power, and their only argument is that heâs a carpool dad,â he added.

Cory Booker on Thursday said he would release a committee confidential document on Judge Brett Kavanaugh during his confirmation hearing, which would violate Senate rules and risk a penalty of expulsion.   The document Booker wants to release is an email regarding Kavanaugh and racial profiling.   The New Jersey senator said, ""I openly invite and accept the consequences."" He said he was aware he could be ""ousted from the Senate.""   After the dramatic moment, Republican Sen. John Cornyn accused Booker of grandstanding as part of his suspected plans to run for president in 2020.   ""Running for president is no excuse for violating the rules of the Senate,"" Cornyn said. ""This is no different from the senator deciding to release classified information that is deemed classified.""   As Cornyn read the rules of expulsion to Booker, the New Jersey senator said, ""Bring it.""    Many of Booker's Democratic colleagues in the committee stood by him and said they'd join him in risking expulsion by releasing committee confidential documents.   The email that Booker said he would release is among thousand of documents handed over to the Senate Judiciary Committee by a lawyer for former President George W. Bush. The documents have been deemed committee confidential, which mean they cannot be made public. The documents relate to Kavanaugh's time as a lawyer in the Bush administration, and reveal his views on everything from abortion to affirmative action.                                                                       Several of the documents were leaked to The New York Times late on Wednesday.   Democrats contend that the documents should be released so the public is fully aware of Kavanaugh's stances on an array of major issues as his nomination for the Supreme Court is considered.

The September 11-17 poll found that 36% of adults surveyed did not want Kavanaugh in the Supreme Court, up six points from a similar poll conducted a month earlier.   Only 31% of US adults polled said they were in favor of Kavanaugh's appointment.   If support for his nomination remains this weak, Trump's pick would rank among the lowest-supported Supreme Court nominees to later be confirmed, according to historical data from Gallup.    ""Not after the sexual charges,"" said Jeffrey Schmidt, 56, from Colorado, who opposes President Trump and his policies. ""Before the allegations, I was not sure.""   Kavanaugh has denied the claim that he assaulted a woman while in high school in 1982, calling it ""completely false.""   Support for Kavanaugh was higher among Republicans, but fewer than two out of three, or 64%, said they were in favor of his nomination.   Thirty-five-year-old Karis Reeves, a Republican-leaning professional from Arizona, said he supported Kavanaugh's nomination, but added he wasn't ""informed enough"" and that the timing of the sexual misconduct allegation was ""conspicuous.""   More women — 33% — opposed Kavanaugh's nomination in the latest Reuters/Ipsos poll, up seven percentage points from a month earlier.   ""It was already a 'no' but now it's a stronger 'no,'"" said Bonnie Mann, 29, when asked about whether her view of Kavanaugh's nomination had changed since the allegation.

Ted Cruz about his dissent in the Priests for Life v. the U.S. Department of Human and Health Services case. In 2015, while serving on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, Kavanaugh sided with a religious organization that objected to providing contraception for employees with insurance. Priests for Life contested the Affordable Care Act (ACA) requirement that all health plans cover birth control, claiming that IUDs and emergency contraception causes abortion instead of acting as birth control. Under the ACA, employers who wished for the government to fund the contraceptives had to fill out a form to their insurers to avoid a monetary fine. In the suit, Priests for Life said filling out the form made them complicit in providing contraception and violated the organization’s religious freedom. The D.C. Circuit Court ruled in favor of the Obama administration while Kavanaugh dissented from the majority. During today’s hearing, Kavanaugh explained his dissent to Cruz. “The question was first, was this a substantial burden on their religious exercise? And it seemed to me, quite clearly, it was,” he said. “They said filling out the form would make them complicit in the abortion-inducing drugs that they were, as a religious matter, objected to.” The phrase “abortion-inducing drugs,” in reference to contraception, was how Priests for Life described the contraception in the suit. Kavanaugh’s wording has many pro-choice organizations up in arms and is said to be proof of his pro-life leanings. Many opposing Kavanaugh’s confirmation have argued if he is approved, he will attempt to overturn Roe vs. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion nationwide. Saying “abortion-inducing drugs” to describe contraception is straight out of the anti-choice, anti-science phrase book used to restrict women’s access to essential health care.  We won’t fall for it and you shouldn’t either. #StopKavanaugh pic.twitter.com/jsyrtNQ5zz — Center for Reproductive Rights (@ReproRights) September 6, 2018  The statement caused a stir among Democrats as well, California Sen. Dianne Feinstein tweeted that Kavanaugh has a gross misunderstanding of the case, “which was about insurance coverage for contraceptives. It’s further proof of Kavanaugh’s hostility toward women’s reproductive freedom.” Judge Kavanaugh just said Burwell v. Hobby Lobby was about ""abortion-inducing drugs.""

    AP British officials are set to present evidence Thursday on the poisoning of an ex-Russian spy and his daughter to the United Nations Security Council. Officials on Wednesday said they charged two suspects, Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov, with using the nerve agent Novichok on Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, in Salisbury last March. Prime Minister Theresa May told British lawmakers the two suspects were Russian military intelligence agents. The Skripals were taken to the hospital in critical condition, but survived. Moscow has denied any involvement in the case.

Even as the nominee stuck to the script that has successfully guided predecessors from both parties to the nation’s highest court, Democratic senators were prepared to show just how much they think the norms have been broken. Within minutes of Republican Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley beginning the session Tuesday morning, Democratis Sen. Kamala Harris of California cut in, arguing that she hadn’t had enough time to review more than 40,000 documents on Kavanaugh that were released Monday night. “We can not possibly move forward with this hearing,” Harris said. As Grassley ruled that her motion was out of order, she fired back, “If we cannot be recognized, I move to adjourn.” For more than an hour, the hearing went completely off the rails as Harris and each of the other nine Democratic members of the committee talked over Grassley’s attempts to begin his opening statement, criticizing the document review process and demanding to delay the hearing for more time to review Kavanaugh’s record. “We are rushing through this process in a way that is unnecessary,” said New Jersey Democrat Cory Booker. President Donald Trump highlighted the Democratic objections in tweets Friday evening, arguing that they were a “display of how mean, angry, and despicable the other side is.” The Brett Kavanaugh hearings for the future Justice of the Supreme Court are truly a display of how mean, angry, and despicable the other side is. They will say anything, and are only…. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 4, 2018  ….looking to inflict pain and embarrassment to one of the most highly renowned jurists to ever appear before Congress. So sad to see! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 4, 2018  Both sides could make a point about transparency using numbers. The committee has received more documents about Kavanaugh than any previous Supreme Court nominee, but those more than 400,000 documents make up just 10% of his record, and don’t include records from his time working as staff secretary in George W. Bush’s White House. Senators on both sides of the aisle bristled at each other, with little sign of collegiality or the team mentality that Kavanaugh — or “Coach K” — promotes when he coaches his daughter’s basketball team, according to a letter from team parents cited by Republican Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona. Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas said the hearing had devolved into “mob rule” by the Democrats. Long-serving Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont lamented the way the nomination was playing out. “I’m just sorry to see the Senate Judiciary Committee descend this way,” he said. Overseeing the chaos, Grassley let the Democrats vent for more than an hour, but wouldn’t call a vote on a motion to adjourn the hearing. “If people have got something to say, this chairman is going to let them say it,” he said. “But it’s pretty boring to hear the same thing all the time.” Later, as Cornyn complained that Democrats were running over their 10-minute allotment for opening statements, Grassley sighed, “I let the committee run me this time.” Much of the Democrats’ frustration may be exacerbated by the fact that they likely won’t be able to prevent Kavanaugh from being confirmed. If Republicans stick together, they can push him through with a simple majority without any votes from the other side. Loudly and publicly voicing opposition is the only real recourse Democrats have to try to affect the outcome. Read More: Democrats Want to Stop Brett Kavanaugh. They May Be Out of Options Republicans on the committee charged that Democrats were following a game plan. Illinois Senator Dick Durbin, the No. 2 Democrat in the Senate, confirmed that there was a conference call over the weekend for Democrats to map out their strategy for the hearing. “There are always many conference calls (and meetings, etc.) before Supreme Court confirmation hearings,” a Democratic aide told TIME in an email. “There has been a lot to talk about in the last several days, including over the long holiday weekend.” While Kavanaugh said that a judge must be “a neutral and impartial arbiter who favors no litigant or policy” and that he does not “decide cases based on personal or policy preferences,” the controversial president who nominated him hung heavy over many of the Democrats’ statements and Tuesday’s proceedings demonstrated what a uniquely political fight Kavanaugh’s nomination has become. It is “ultimately an effort to re-litigate the last presidential election,” said Republican Sen. Mike Crapo of Idaho. Tensions in the hearing room, already high among the senators on the dais, were amplified by near-constant interruptions by protesters from the seats reserved for spectators in the back. As the committee bickered up front, dozens of protesters were removed throughout the day for standing up and yelling during the proceedings. “Kavanaugh is a danger to the future of America!” one protester cried. “My daughter deserves the right to choose!” “Moving forward with this nomination is against everything we stand for as a nation!” yelled another protester wearing a shirt that said “spiritual gangster” on it. Multiple disruptions came from people who said they had preexisting conditions and were worried about their healthcare coverage. A group of women wearing red handmaids’ robes from the television show “The Handmaid’s Tale” kept a silent vigil outside the hearing room as people entered in the morning; as other demonstrators were escorted out throughout the day, those in the hearing room could still hear them chanting “Hell nah, Kavanaugh!” outside. In fact, irritation with disruptive protesters became one of the only issues that sparked agreement between political parties during the day. Democrat Leahy said he wouldn’t keep reading his opening statement during the interruptions. “I don’t care whose side they’re on,” he said. Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah complained about the “insolence” of the protesters and said, “These people are so out of line they shouldn’t even be allowed into the doggone room.” Throughout the chaos emanating from both the front and back of the room, Kavanaugh sat quietly at his desk facing the senators, in the eye of the storm. “The Supreme Court must never, never be viewed as a partisan institution,” Kavanaugh said during his opening statement, which didn’t begin until just before 5 pm. “The Justices on the Supreme Court do not sit on opposite sides of an aisle.” It was a rosy sentiment, and one that was undermined by the nearly seven hours of highly political fighting that had preceded it.",0.1,0.846,0.054,-0.9949,0.46113872717321

On Wednesday, Kavanaugh can expect to spend most of the day in the hot seat, sparring with Democratic senators over abortion, guns, executive power and other high-profile issues. A long day of questioning awaits the 53-year-old appellate judge, whom Trump nominated in July to fill the seat of retired Justice Anthony Kennedy. The change could make the court more conservative on a range of issues. Barring a surprise, Republicans appear on track to confirm Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, perhaps in time for the first day of the new term, Oct. 1, little more than a month before congressional elections. However, the first of at least four days of hearings by the Senate Judiciary Committee began with partisan quarreling over the nomination and persistent protests from members of the audience, followed by their arrests. Strong Democratic opposition to Trump’s nominee reflects the political stakes for both parties in advance of the November elections, Robert Mueller’s investigation of Trump’s 2016 campaign and the potentially pivotal role Kavanaugh could play in moving the court to the right. Democrats, including several senators poised for 2020 presidential bids, tried to block the proceedings in a dispute over Kavanaugh records withheld by the White House. Republicans in turn accused the Democrats of turning the hearing into a circus. Trump jumped into the fray late in the day, saying on Twitter that Democrats were “looking to inflict pain and embarrassment” on Kavanaugh. The president’s comment followed the statements of Democratic senators who warned that Trump was, in the words of Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, “selecting a justice on the Supreme Court who potentially will cast a decisive vote in his own case.” In Kavanaugh’s own statement at the end of more than seven hours of arguing, the federal appeals judge spoke repeatedly about the importance of an independent judiciary and the need to keep the court above partisan politics, common refrains among Supreme Court nominees that had added salience in the fraught political atmosphere of the moment. With his wife, two children and parents sitting behind him, Kavanaugh called himself a judge with a straightforward judicial philosophy. “A judge must be independent and must interpret the law, not make the law. A judge must interpret statutes as written. A judge must interpret the Constitution as written, informed by history and tradition and precedent,” he said. The most likely outcome of this week’s hearings is a vote along party lines to send Kavanaugh’s nomination to the full Senate. Majority Republicans can confirm Kavanaugh without any Democratic votes, though they’ll have little margin for error. “There are battles worth fighting, regardless of the outcome,” Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, said in an unsparing opening statement that criticized Kavanaugh’s judicial opinions and the Senate process that Democrats said had deprived them of access to records of important chunks of Kavanaugh’s time as an aide to President George W. Bush. Democrats raised objections from the moment Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, gaveled the committee to order. One by one, Democrats, including Kamala Harris of California, Cory Booker of New Jersey and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, all potential presidential contenders, demanded that Republicans delay the hearing. They railed against the unusual vetting process by Republicans that failed to include documents from three years Kavanaugh worked in the Bush administration, and 100,000 more pages withheld by the Trump White House. Some 42,000 pages were released to senators only, not the public, on the evening before the hearing. As protesters repeatedly interrupted the session, Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, who is fighting for his own re-election in Texas, apologized to Kavanaugh for the spectacle he said had less to do about the judge’s legal record than Trump in the White House. “It is about politics,” said Cruz. “It is about Democratic senators re-litigating the 2016 election.” Republicans will hold a slim 51-49 majority in the Senate once Jon Kyl, the former Arizona senator, is sworn in to fill the seat held by the late Sen. John McCain. Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska are the only two Republicans even remotely open to voting against Kavanaugh, though neither has said she would do so. Abortion rights supporters are trying to appeal to those senators, who both favor abortion access.",0.068,0.859,0.073,0.7373,0.48005921751204766

But perhaps DeVos’s most alarming error to date has received insufficient public attention. This disregard is regrettable because her blunder illuminates one of the U.S. Supreme Court’s most momentous opinions — and exposes a mounting threat to the decision. As last school year drew to a close, Congressman Adrian Espaillat of New York asked DeVos in a committee hearing whether public educators could report undocumented students to Immigration and Customs Enforcement. “Sir, I think that’s a school decision,” DeVos replied. “That’s a community decision.” That response, however, revealed a deluded conception of unauthorized immigrants’ constitutional rights. In 1982, the Supreme Court, in a 5-4 decision called Plyler v. Doe, rejected a Texas law that authorized local schools to exclude undocumented students. Writing for the Court, Justice William Brennan found that the law impermissibly punished “innocent children” for parental misconduct, and that it clashed with the country’s deepest constitutional commitments. If left unchecked, Brennan reasoned, the measure “raise[d] the specter of a permanent caste of undocumented resident aliens,” a development “present[ing] most difficult problems for a Nation that prides itself on adherence to principles of equality under law.” In essence, a student’s immigration status forms an illegitimate basis for barring children from school. When the Court issued Plyler, no state in the country other than Texas had enacted such legislation. This legislative backdrop has motivated prominent constitutional scholars to dismiss Plyler as an insignificant opinion that invalidated merely an outlier statute. The Court’s decision is thus construed as merely eliminating a blatantly outlandish measure — one that would hold no appeal beyond the Lone Star State, where a cowboy mentality prevails. But such dismissive assessments miss the mark. Rather than some trivial event in the nation’s constitutional history, it seems far more accurate to understand Plyler as preventing an isolated measure from becoming pervasive, as anxieties about unauthorized immigrants extend well beyond states along the southern border. Few opinions in American history have had more profound consequences than Plyler’s guarantee that the schoolhouse doors cannot be closed to one of society’s most marginalized, vilified groups. The opinion has single-handedly enabled innumerable children to use education to expand both their minds and their horizons. About two weeks after her blunder, DeVos retreated from claiming that public schools could police students’ immigration status, labeling Plyler a “settled case” and conceding that undocumented students “have the right to an education.” The pressing question now, however, is: how much longer will that right exist? Several factors suggest that Plyler could soon be endangered. Trump’s successful presidential campaign, which cast unauthorized immigrants as boogeymen, revealed unmistakably that nativist sentiment exerts a powerful force throughout the country. That reality indicates it is only a matter of time before localities, states and perhaps even the federal government enact measures challenging Plyler. (One could imagine supporters echoing the Trump Administration’s logic for its family-separation policy: that it would deter parents from bringing their children to the United States illegally.) Although Alabama and California both enacted legislation designed to undermine Plyler several years ago, those efforts were successfully interred in lower federal courts. But this time could be different. Indeed, ample reason suggests the Supreme Court could greet new anti-Plyler legislation favorably. In 1982, a young lawyer working in the Reagan Administration named John G. Roberts, Jr. coauthored a memorandum bemoaning the Department of Justice’s failure to file an amicus brief in Plyler actively supporting Texas. Had it done so, Roberts speculated, the Court would have upheld the law. Now the Chief Justice, if Roberts continues to believe that Plyler erred, then he could well rally his fellow conservative colleagues to overturn the decision. Roberts’s burden on this front appears on the verge of growing easier, as Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearings commence. If — as seems probable — Kavanaugh secures confirmation, he would fill the seat of his old boss, Justice Anthony Kennedy. Kennedy’s jurisprudence often exhibited solicitude for the plight of vulnerable children — the reasoning in Plyler. Yet while it was exceedingly difficult to envision Kennedy abandoning undocumented children, it seems eminently plausible that Kavanaugh would do so. The reason is simple: Kavanaugh, unlike Kennedy, has been a steadfast, even exuberant participant in the Republican party’s movement for constitutional conservatism, and the G.O.P. has now coalesced around an anti-immigrant ethos. Where Kennedy often bucked Federalist Society orthodoxy, only a naïf would doubt Kavanaugh’s devotion. If Democratic Senators press Kavanaugh on Plyler in hearings, he will likely, borrowing from Secretary DeVos, deem the opinion “settled.” But that is no guarantee that he will uphold the precedent, a prospect that undocumented families — and, indeed, all families — should find unsettling.

Judge Brett Kavanaugh, 53, has served for the past 12 years on the appeals court in Washington, D.C., which is considered the second most important court in the country after the Supreme Court. He has a solidly conservative record, including a dissenting opinion last year that would have denied immediate access to an abortion for an immigrant teenager in federal custody. 






Kavanaugh worked in key White House positions when George W. Bush was president and was a member of independent counsel Kenneth Starr’s legal team that investigated President Bill Clinton in the late 1990s, leading to Clinton’s impeachment.


As a young lawyer, Kavanaugh worked for Justice Anthony Kennedy, the man he would replace on the high court. Kennedy retired at the end of July. Trump’s first nominee, Justice Neil Gorsuch, also was a Kennedy law clerk the same year as Kavanaugh.
The first day of the Senate Judiciary Committee hearings Tuesday will feature opening statements from senators and Kavanaugh himself. His remarks are not likely to be released in advance, but nominees often sing the praises of judicial independence. When he was sworn in as an appellate judge in 2006, Kavanaugh called an independent judiciary “the crown jewel of our constitutional democracy.”
Questioning will begin on Wednesday, and votes in committee and on the Senate floor could occur later in September. If all goes as Republicans plan, Kavanaugh could be on the bench when the court begins its new term on Oct. 1.

Sen. Chuck Grassley, the Iowa Republican who is the committee chairman, has called Kavanaugh “one of the most qualified nominees ever picked for the court.” The American Bar Association has given Kavanaugh its highest rating, well qualified.
Rebuffed in their request to delay the hearing, Democrats are planning to shine a light on Kavanaugh’s views on abortion, executive power and whether Trump could be forced to testify as part of special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation.
“I remain troubled by your view of executive power,” Democratic Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware, a committee member, wrote Friday in an open letter to Kavanaugh. “I am not satisfied with your responses to me during our private meeting, and I believe that you owe the Committee and the American people more thorough, candid answers during your hearing next week.”


Many Democratic senators already have announced their intention to vote against Kavanaugh and many Republicans have likewise signaled their support. A handful of Democrats seeking re-election in states Trump carried in 2016 could vote for Kavanaugh.
If no Democrat ultimately supports the nomination, the Republicans have no margin for error in a Senate they control by 50-49. Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska are the only two Republicans even remotely open to voting against Kavanaugh, though neither has said she would do so. Abortion rights supporters are trying to appeal to those senators by focusing on concerns that Kavanaugh could vote to limit abortion rights or even overturn the landmark Roe v. Wade ruling from 1973 that first established a woman’s constitutional right to an abortion.


Democrats have been under intense pressure from liberal voters to resist Trump, and many remain irate, even two years later, over the treatment of Merrick Garland, President Barack Obama’s nominee for the Supreme Court, who was denied so much as a hearing last year by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.
But Democrats are powerless to delay a vote on Kavanaugh since McConnell led Republicans, during the Gorsuch nomination, in eliminating the 60-vote filibuster threshold that had been in place for Supreme Court nominations.
The filibuster rule required 60 of the 100 votes to advance a bill or nomination, in contrast to the simple 51-vote majority that applies in most cases.

Speaking to supporters at a campaign rally in Montana on Thursday, President Trump went on the offensive against Democrats over what he described as ""sick"" attacks against his nominee for the Supreme Court, Judge Brett Kavanaugh.
 
""Heâs doing really well,"" Trump said, acknowledging Kavanaugh's tense three days of confirmation hearings in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee. ""But do you believe the anger and the meanness on the other side? Sick, itâs sick!""
 
Trump took the stage in Billings tonight and appeared to be in cheerful spirits as he launched into a montage of searing attacks against Democrats, the 'deep state,' Jon Tester, the media, and critics who have questioned his fitness for office.
 
During the rally, the president went on a more extended, scripted rift on the ""deep state"" following the New York Timesâ op-ed by the anonymous senior administration official claiming to be part of an anti-Trump resistance.
 
 
 
""Nobody knows who the hell he is. Or she. But they said he. But probably thatâs a little disguise,"" Trump said. ""Unidentified deep state operatives who defy voters to push their own secret agendas are truly a threat to democracy itself. And I was so heartened when I looked, I think itâs backfired.""
 
Speaking of Democratic lawmakers who have threatened him with impeachment if the party takes back the House, the president seemed to indicate that the subject had been on his mind lately as he warned his supporters what it could mean for the future of the country.
 
 At Montana rally, Pres. Trump goes after Democrats for ""sick"" attacks against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. https://t.co/dC6hBoUt0O pic.twitter.com/VlhIOsywKL 
 
""If it does happen it's your fault, because you didn't go out to vote,"" Trump said, after warning it would turn America into a ""third world country"" where every following president would likely be impeached for political purposes.
 
""Todayâs Democratic party is held hostage by haters, absolute haters, left wing haters. Angry mobs, deep state radicals and their fake news allies, those people are the best,"" Trump said.
 
A notable contrast though, was President Trump's willingness to blast his domestic political opponents as ""sick,"" even as he lavished praise on two brutal dictators, Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
 
""[Kim Jong Un] likes me, I like him, who knows what is going to happen!"" Trump said.
 
""One of my best meetings ever was with Vladimir Putin, and they said 'He was too nice,'"" Trump told the crowd. ""They wanted me to have a boxing match on this stage.""
 
Even as the president ginned up the crowd to boo the media, he lavished praise on Rep. Greg Gianforte as a âfighterâ despite his conviction last year for assaulting a journalist.
 
""He's fought in more ways than one for your state,"" Trump said. ""He is a fighter and a winner.""
 
 
 
The president fumed as he recounted Sen. Jon Testerâs treatment of his former personal physician, Adm. Ronny Jackson, who withdrew himself from consideration as VA Secretary after allegations surfaced that he fostered a hostile work environment while serving as head of the White House medical unit.
 
""One of the saddest things Iâve seen is when Jon Tester -- and what he did to a great, great man Adm. Ronny Jackson,"" Trump said. ""Adm. Jackson was subjected to horrible lies and smears, and Iâm a victim of that too but Iâm kind of getting used to it. At least itâs my job. I guess Iâm a politician. Think of it!""
 
Trump seemed to brush off reports heâs furious over the New York Times op-ed, and suggested heâs instead been screaming and raving over trade negotiations with Canada.
 
 Pres. Trump talks about 'gutless coward' behind New York Times op-ed: ""Nobody knows who the hell he is. Or she. Although they put he. But probably that's a little disguise: That means it's she."" https://t.co/9losmf8nmj pic.twitter.com/cWlpB8DMYq 
 
""They had me stomping around screaming with anger up in my area of the White House where I live with my wife and son, Barron. They had me screaming, shouting like a lunatic. I had six people in my office, I was in the oval office, we are having a talk on trade, it actually happened to be trade with Canada. And they said 'Sir, you are not up there screaming and ranting and raving. You're here talking,'"" Trump said.
 
Before taking the stage at his rally, President Trump joined Fox News' Pete Hegseth at a separate side platform in the arena for a 10-minute interview.
 
 
 
The president again unloaded on the New York Times following its Wednesday op-ed.
 
""Well number one, The Times should never have done that because really what they've done is virtually, you know, it's treason,"" Trump said. ""You could call it a lot of things.""
 
 
 
The president added that he's more frustrated about the anonymity, because he believes it's easier to discredit something negative written about him when the author isn't anonymous, alluding to several books published in the past year that have painted the White House as on the brink of chaos.
 
""When somebody writes and you can't discredit because you have no idea who they are, usually you'll find out it was a background that was bad, it may not be a Republican, it may not be a conservative, it may be a deep state person that's been there a long time,"" Trump said. ""We don't know where -- it's a very unfair thing, and it's very unfair to our country and the millions of people who voted for us.""
 
 
 
The president then was asked about his recent threats that he might try and shut down the government over funding for his proposed wall along the U.S.-Mexico border prior to the midterms, but seemed to settle on waiting until after the election is over.
 
 
 
""So most likely I will not do that but weâre going to do it immediately after the election,"" Trump said, adding he had a ""commitment"" from Paul Ryan, Mitch McConnell and other congressional leaders to help push for a shutdown.
 
Trump's visit to the state is the latest swing in what he has promised will be an aggressive effort on behalf of Republicans leading up to the November midterms. Democratic Sen. Jon Tester is looking to fend off a challenge from state auditor Matt Rosendale, who has cozied up with Trump's agenda in a state that Trump won in 2016 by 20 points.",0.116,0.83,0.054,-0.997,0.44966206818616455

Meanwhile, Senate Democrats are looking to block the nominee.   Because of the split nature of the Senate, in which Republicans control 51 seats and Democrats have 49 (including two independents who caucus with Democrats), the confirmation process will come down to the wire. Republicans need a minimum of 50 votes, creating a scenario in which Vice President Mike Pence could cast the deciding vote as the tie-breaker.   Most senators are reliable to toe the party line as to how they vote for Kavanaugh. But the vote count will likely be closer than ever, because of a mix of two moderate Republican in Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine, along with a handful of Democrats facing tough reelection bids this November in traditionally red states.   The Senate Judiciary Committee's series confirmation hearing for Kavanaugh began on Tuesday, September 4, when political infighting enveloped much of the panel. But the committee's chairman, Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley, vowed to continue moving forward with the process.   Kavanaugh's confirmation appeared to be  on the ropes when a woman came forward accusing him of sexually assaulting her when they were both teenagers in the early 1980s.   The Judiciary Committee has scheduled an additional hearing with Kavanaugh slated for Monday, September 24. Christine Blasey Ford, the woman accusing Kavanaugh, has declined to testify until the FBI has investigated the matter.

Christine Blasey Ford says in the interview with The Washington Post that Kavanaugh and a friend — both “stumbling drunk, she says — corralled her into a bedroom during the party in the early 1980s. She says Kavanaugh groped her over her clothes, grinded his body against hers and tried to take off her one-piece swimsuit and the outfit she wore over it. Kavanaugh covered her mouth with his hand when she tried to scream, she says. “I thought he might inadvertently kill me,” says Ford, 51, and a professor at Palo Alto University in California. “He was trying to attack me and remove my clothing.” She says she was able to get away after Kavanaugh’s friend jumped on top of them and everyone tumbled. Kavanaugh has denied the allegation. He repeated that denial again Sunday through the White House. “I categorically and unequivocally deny this allegation. I did not do this back in high school or at any time,” Kavanaugh said. Ford says in the interview that she never revealed what had happened to her until 2012, when she and her husband sought couples therapy. Portions of her therapist’s notes, which Ford provided to the Post, do not mention Kavanaugh by name but say Ford reported being attacked by students “from an elitist boys’ school” who went on to become “highly respected and high-ranking members of society in Washington.” Kavanaugh, 53, is a federal appeals judge in Washington. President Donald Trump nominated him in July to replace retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy on the U.S. Supreme Court. The therapist’s notes say four boys were involved, but Ford says that was an error by the therapist. Ford says four boys were at the party, but only two boys were in the room at the time. Ford had contacted the Post through a tip line in early July after it had become clear that Kavanaugh was on Trump’s shortlist to fill a vacancy but before the Republican president nominated him. A registered Democrat, Ford contacted her representative in Congress, Democrat Ann Eshoo, around the same time. In late July, Ford sent a letter through Eshoo’s office to Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee. Feinstein revealed late last week that she had received a letter, but said the author did not want to come forward. Ford told the Post she decided to come forward after watching portions of her story come out without her permission.

Dianne Feinstein, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said Thursday she has notified federal investigators about information she received — and won’t disclose publicly — concerning Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. The California Democrat said in a statement that she “received information from an individual concerning the nomination.” She said the person “strongly requested confidentiality, declined to come forward or press the matter further, and I have honored that decision.” The Judiciary Committee, which has finished confirmation hearings for Kavanagh, is scheduled to vote next Thursday on whether to recommend that Kavanaugh’s nomination be confirmed by the full Senate. Feinstein’s statement that she has “referred the matter to federal investigative authorities” jolted Capitol Hill and threatens to disrupt what has been a steady path toward confirmation for Kavanaugh by Republicans eager to see the conservative judge on the court. An FBI spokeswoman declined to comment. Feinstein declined to answer questions outside the hearing room, and other senators’ offices largely deferred to the ranking member. Democratic senators on the panel met privately Wednesday evening and discussed the information, according to two Senate aides who were not authorized to discuss the situation publicly but spoke on condition of anonymity. The White House questioned the timing of Feinstein’s move, calling it an “11th hour attempt to delay his confirmation.” “Throughout his confirmation process, Judge Kavanaugh has had 65 meetings with senators — including with Senator Feinstein — sat through over 30 hours of testimony, addressed over 2,000 questions in a public setting and additional questions in a confidential session. Not until the eve of his confirmation has Sen. Feinstein or anyone raised the specter of new ‘information’ about him,” said Kerri Kupec, a White House spokesperson. Kupec added that the FBI has vetted Kavanaugh “thoroughly and repeatedly” during his career in government and the judiciary. Democrats don’t have the votes to block Kavanaugh’s nomination, if Republicans hold unified, but are fighting it and decrying the process that Republicans used to compile his government records for review. At the committee Thursday, Republicans brushed aside a flurry of Democratic attempts to delay the consideration of Kavanaugh or subpoena more documents about his past work, sticking with a schedule that could see him confirmed by Oct. 1. Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut protested that the nomination will be “tainted” and “stained” by the unusual process for vetting the nominee. “We lack the time. We lack the documents.” He called it a “badly broken process.” Feinstein had sought a subpoena for documents from Kavanaugh’s time as Bush’s staff secretary. She said senators “should be able to see this record” and wondered, “What in Judge Kavanaugh’s records are Republicans hiding?” The Republicans have declined to pursue Kavanaugh’s staff secretary documents, saying it would be too cumbersome. They rejected Feinstein’s motion and several others, including motions to subpoena documents and witnesses and a motion to adjourn. Chairman Chuck Grassley set the panel’s vote on Kavanaugh for Sept. 20. New documents released ahead of Thursday’s hearing included Kavanaugh’s 263-page written response to questions from senators, along with dozens of files from the judge’s work in the George W. Bush White House that had been available to senators only on a “committee confidential basis.” Democratic Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey made the Bush documents public. Among the details in the new written responses, Kavanaugh says he would have shaken the hand of a school shooting victim’s father during a break in last week’s Senate hearing had he recognized him before being whisked away by security detail. The 28 new “committee confidential” documents released by Booker, meanwhile, are from Kavanaugh’s time in the White House counsel’s office during the George W. Bush administration and deal with his work on judicial nominations. The documents show Kavanaugh’s involvement in Bush’s nomination of Charles Pickering to an appellate court in the South as Pickering faced questions about his views on race relations. Kavanaugh had indicated in 2006 testimony that he was not substantially involved in the nomination. In releasing a new batch of committee confidential documents about Kavanaugh, Booker, the New Jersey Democrat, was repeating a tactic that could prompt a review from the Senate Ethics Committee. Booker is being criticized by his GOP colleagues and outside groups for releasing the documents. Last week, he released some documents that were later made public by the committee, but also others that weren’t. Wednesday’s disclosure brings the total to 75. The conservative group Judicial Watch delivered a letter Wednesday to the Senate Ethics Committee seeking an investigation. It says Booker violated Senate rules against disclosing confidential documents and could face Senate expulsion. Booker has welcomed the fight. He says the documents about Kavanaugh’s work “raise more serious and concerning questions” about his honesty during his testimony before the committee. At issue has been the unprecedented process the Senate Judiciary Committee used for gathering documents on Kavanaugh, an appellate court judge who is President Donald Trump’s nominee to replace retired Justice Anthony Kennedy on the court. __ Associated Press writer Eric Tucker in Washington contributed to this report.",0.054,0.908,0.038,-0.9445,0.3670650271714102

    When Brett Kavanaugh walked away from a Parkland shooting victim's father after he tried to shake his hand, many people were left wondering, where exactly does Supreme Court nominee stand on gun control laws?
    USA TODAY President Donald Trump's Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, a federal appeals court judge, holds up a worn copy of the Constitution of the United States as he testifies before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington, Wednesday, Sept. 5, 2018, for the second day of his confirmation to replace retired Justice Anthony Kennedy. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik) ORG XMIT: DCAH120(Photo: Andrew Harnik, AP) WASHINGTONÂ âÂ  Supreme Court nomineeÂ Brett Kavanaugh was back before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday for the second day of hearings that are continuing well into the night. This time, though, Kavanaugh was able to respond to questions and the public was able to hear directly from him on several key topics. Kavanaugh, an appeals court judge nominated for the Supreme Court by President Donald Trump, answered senators' questions on high-profile issues ranging from abortion to gun control to presidential power. Here's a look at what the judge had to say on some of the most controversial issues as the day went on. A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.  A coalition of groups opposingÂ Kavanaugh's Supreme Court nomination urged activists across America to travel to Washington to disrupt his Senate confirmation hearings this week, and many answered the call.Â  Capitol police arrested 70 people for outbursts andÂ disruptions during Kavanaugh's hearing TuesdayÂ âÂ and the protests continued during hisÂ testimonyÂ Wednesday. The protests were so constantÂ that Wednesday's hearing assumed a decidedly halting cadence, andÂ senators expressed frustration at the interruptions. Police temporarily closed off the hearing from additional spectators at one point, leaving some seats empty. Â  
    Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh says a 1973 Supreme Court decision that established a constitutional right to an abortion is an ""important precedent"" that has ""been reaffirmed many times."" (Sept. 5)
    AP Kavanaugh is a devout Catholic and some abortion rights advocates fear he could become the deciding vote that overturns Roe vs. Wade âÂ the landmark 1973 case that decided women have a constitutional right toÂ an abortion. ""It has been reported that you have said that Roe is now settled law,"" Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., said to the judge. ""What do you mean by settled law? Do you believe it is correct law?"" More: Brett Kavanaugh: His views on key issues he could face as a Supreme Court justice More: Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh highlights independence in hearing: 'No one is above the law' Kavanaugh said the case ""is an important precedent of the Supreme Court that has been reaffirmed many times."" He said the 1992 case of Planned Parenthood vs. Casey had created ""precedent upon precedent"" by clearly reaffirming Roe in ruling thatÂ ""matters, involving the most intimate and personal choices a person may make in a lifetime ... are central to the liberty protected by theÂ Fourteenth Amendment."" Kavanaugh also told Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, that ""my personalÂ beliefsÂ are not relevant to how I decide cases.""Â  
    Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh is declining to answer questions about the extent of the president's pardon power. (Sept. 5)
    AP Democrats tried to get Kavanaugh's to say how he might rule if matters relating to special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation implicate the president.Â  He would notÂ say if he believes a sitting president has the right toÂ refuse to answer a subpoenaÂ or to pardon himself, asÂ Trump has said he has the rightÂ to do. Kavanaugh called itÂ a ""hypothetical question.Â  When asked if he wouldÂ owe loyalty to President Donald Trump, Kavanaugh said his loyalty would be to the Constitution.Â  ""No one is above the law in our constitutional system,"" he said. And he praised the landmark Supreme Court ruling that President Richard Nixon was required to turn over White House tape recordings and other evidence related to the Watergate scandal. Kavanaugh defended his dissent in a key 2011Â gun control caseÂ before the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The majority of judges upheld Washington, D.C.'s, gun registration law and its ban on semi-automatic weapons, which the city classified as assault weapons. Kavanaugh said he based his dissent on a Supreme Court ruling that ""dangerous and unusual weapons""Â â such as machine gunsÂ â could be banned. But he said he didn't see semi-automatic rifles as ""unusual."" ""Handguns and semi-automatic rifles are weapons used for hunting and self-defense,"" he said. ""Thatâs what makes this issue difficult.""Â  Republican Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona tried not once, but twice, to engageÂ Kavanaugh in questions arising from one of President Donald Trump's tweets, but the Supreme Court nominee declined to respond. Flake said he was concerned about the executive branch and asked whether a president should be able to use his authority to carry out directives for political gain. He specifically referred to Trump's tweet against Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Monday, where he complained that criminal charges against two Republican congressmen could hurt the party in the midterm election. Kavanaugh said maintaining judicial independence ""requires me to avoid commenting on current events."" Flake then took Trump out of the question. Kavanaugh still declined to engage in a hypothetical he said closely resembled the earlier one. Contributing: Nathan Bomey, Associated Press",0.093,0.766,0.141,0.9965,0.46987259816207183

Christine Blasey Ford, a 51-year-old research psychologist and professor, spoke to the Washington Post to identify herself as the previously anonymous subject in a letter that detailed an incident in the early 1980s in suburban Maryland.   The New Yorker reported details about the letter, but did not identify Ford, who recounted the allegation to the Post that a ""stumbling drunk"" Kavanaugh pinned her down and forced himself on her while his friend watched and stifled her screams.   ""I thought he might inadvertently kill me,"" Ford said of the alleged attack. ""He was trying to attack me and remove my clothing.""   The accusation first became publicly known after Sen. Dianne Feinstein  sent the letter to the FBI on Thursday without identifying its contents to fellow lawmakers on the Judiciary Committee.   The California Democrat, and ranking member of the committee, said in a statement she was compelled to honor the request for anonymity, and found the allegations serious enough to be referred to federal authorities.   Kavanaugh denied the allegations in a statement from the White House: ""I categorically and unequivocally deny this allegation. I did not do this back in high school or at any time.""   Feinstein said in a Sunday afternoon statement: ""I support Mrs. Ford's decision to share her story, and now that she has, it is in the hands of the FBI to conduct an investigation. This should happen before the Senate moves forward on this nominee.""   The Post corroborated Ford's account with an interview with her husband, a lie detector test from her lawyer, and notes from therapy sessions that include mention of a ""rape attempt"" by students from an ""elitist boys school"" who would become ""highly respected and high-ranking members of society in Washington.""                                                                                                           Though not confirmed, Ford told the Post she thought it might have happened when she was 15 in the summer of 1982, after her sophomore year at Bethesda's all-girls Holton-Arms School in Bethesda.   Kavanaugh would have been 17 at the time, attending Georgetown Preparatory School in Bethesda. Ford said the friend in the room was Mark Judge, a conservative writer who The New York Times previously identified. The Post wasn't able to reach Judge, and he told The Times, ""I never saw anything like what was described.""   Ford told the Post she decided to come forward after she feared for her privacy and story's accuracy after reporters visited her at home and at work, and another reporter called her colleagues.   ""These are all the ills that I was trying to avoid,"" she said. ""Now I feel like my civic responsibility is outweighing my anguish and terror about retaliation.""   Kavanaugh is in the midst of a high-profile, marathon confirmation process.

Despite efforts by most Senate Democrats to protest his nomination and delay his confirmation hearings, Judge Brett Kavanaugh is set to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee Tuesday to make the case he belongs on the Supreme Court.
 
Following his hearings, the former Bush administration staffer and current D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals judge should have a relatively smooth path to confirmation, which is likely to take place well before the November midterm elections.
 
The Senateâs minority members, save a few centrists, have argued that Kavanaughâs record as a top staffer in the George W. Bush White House has not been adequately vetted and that his hearings should be postponed altogether because of the legal issues surrounding President Donald Trump.
 
They also have specifically raised issues concerning Kavanaugh's views on executive power, suggesting that Trump chose him because he has stated he's opposed to sitting presidents being investigated.
 
But Republicans have dismissed those concerns as politically-driven. They also have the majority status, and, likely, the votes, to confirm Kavanaugh on their terms and schedule.
 
 
 
âI look forward, along with the rest of the Senate, in performing our constitutional duties beginning next week, providing advice and consent on this important nomination,â Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Tuesday.
 
Kavanaugh is virtually assured of the Senate support he needs to be confirmed. He is expected to have the votes of all 50 sitting Republicans, and Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey is required by law to appoint a Republican to fill the seat of the late Sen. John McCain, so it's possible that McCain's replacement (likely someone who would toe the party line) will be seated by the time Kavanaughâs nomination comes before the full Senate, which would bring him the needed 51 votes.
 
There are a handful of Senate Democrats who also might vote for Kavanaugh, particularly red-state Democrats up for re-election this November, including Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, who has said he wouldn't announce how he'd vote âuntil I complete a thorough and fair examination of his candidacy.â
 
In the unlikely event no Democrats join Republicans â and a McCain replacement has not yet been sworn in â Vice President Mike Pence could cast the tie-breaking vote in Kavanaugh's favor.
 
The virtual certainty of Kavanaughâs confirmation, however, has not slowed Democratsâ resolve to voice their objections to Kavanaughâs record and the confirmation process, which they say has been inadequate in scope and timing.
 
Democrats have argued that they deserve to review Kavanaughâs records as White House staff secretary during the Bush administration, a role in which he oversaw all documents that made it to the presidentâs desk, including on controversial policy matters. In a letter to Senate Judiciary Committee Charles Grassley sent Tuesday, all 10 committee Democrats accused the majority of âdiscourag[ing] the National Archives from responding to our separate request for his records as Staff Secretary from 2003 to 2006.â
 
""For Republicans to suggest that records related to his position as White House staff secretary arenât relevant to the committeeâs review of his nomination is distressing,"" Sen. Dianne Feinstein has said previously, noting that Kavanaugh himself has referred to his tenure as staff secretary in describing the full measure of his record.
 
 
 
Grassley, R-Iowa, has argued that Kavanaughâs record as staff secretary is irrelevant to his judicial philosophy and that making all related documents available would run the risk of disclosing classified information.
 
Republicans have also pointed out that more documents have been made available pertaining to Kavanaughâs career than have been provided concerning any other Supreme Court nominee. On Tuesday, the Judiciary Committee released an additional 85,000 pages of material related to Kavanaughâs service as a White House lawyer during the George W. Bush administration.
 
Democrats, including Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn, have also highlighted their concerns related to Kavanaughâs views on executive power, particularly those he laid out in a 2009 article in which he argued that sitting presidents should not be subject to criminal investigations or a prosecutorâs questions while in office, and suggested Congress pass a law to that effect. His views were shaped by his experience serving on independent counsel Kenneth Starrâs team investigating then-president Bill Clinton.
 
The minority members of the Judiciary Committee will likely hammer Kavanaugh with questions on that viewpoint.
 
Most recently, Senate Democrats began calling for a pause in the nomination proceedings in light of former Trump confidante Michael Cohenâs allegations that Trump directed him to make payments to women with whom Trump had affairs, in order to keep them from speaking out. Several Senate Democrats also canceled their meetings with Kavanaugh following the Cohen revelations.
 
âHe's been nominated by a president who's been implicated in a criminal conspiracy,â said Blumenthal, shortly after the Cohen allegations came to light. âThere is no way that his nomination will be untainted. The court itself will be stained.â
 
Cohen did not mention Trump by name in a statement made when he made his plea agreement and Trump was not named as an ""unindicted co-conspirator"" as some Democrats said.
 
But Grassley dismissed the canceled meetings â and the calls for a delay that followed â as political posturing.
 
âThis is just another obvious and opportunistic attempt to push the confirmation past the midterm elections,â Grassley said Tuesday.
 
Amid the partisan sniping, Kavanaugh himself appears to be operating full steam ahead as well. According to a senior White House official, the judge has been drilled in at least two full-day mock hearings and is feeling confident about his upcoming performance.",0.047,0.903,0.05,0.4966,0.44731182795698915

    Democrats are calling for a delay in the confirmation hearings of Brett Kavanaugh, objecting to the late release of documents the evening before. (Sept. 4)
    AP President Donald Trump's Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, a federal appeals court judge, holds up a worn copy of the Constitution of the United States as he testifies before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington, Wednesday, Sept. 5, 2018, for the second day of his confirmation to replace retired Justice Anthony Kennedy. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik) ORG XMIT: DCAH120(Photo: Andrew Harnik, AP) WASHINGTONÂ â Brett Kavanaugh arrived at his Supreme Court confirmation hearing this week seemingly outflanked by his opponents. In front of him, former prosecutors stared down from the Democrats' side of the Senate Judiciary Committee dais. Behind him, scores of protesters loomed, ready to interrupt the proceedings at every turn. For ammunition, both groups had a dispute over withheld documents and the travails of the man who nominated him, President Donald Trump. After more than 24 hours of testimony, however, Kavanaugh emerged largely unbroken, waving not a white flag but his battered copy of the Constitution. How the soft-spoken, 53-year-old federal appeals court judge did it is a lesson in tried and true tactics: Steer clear of politics. Hide behind precedent. Don't answer hypothetical questions. Empathize with opponents. And have a faulty memory. A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.  For two days that went well into the night, Kavanaugh offered a master class in answering the questions he wanted to hear, rather than the ones actually asked. ""You're becoming really good,"" Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, said as the nominee expounded on a response longer than necessary. ""You're learning to filibuster."" Here are fiveÂ 'gotcha' moments from whichÂ Kavanaugh escaped: Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-Rhode Island, was among the Democrats asking whether President Donald Trump chose Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court to save him in a future criminal case. (Photo: USAT) Like Associate Justice Neil Gorsuch, confirmed 54-45 last year, Kavanaugh was asked to answer for some of Trump's most impolitic remarks. In Gorsuch's case, it was the president's 2017 attacks on federal judges. In carefully scripted remarks, theÂ Coloradan called themÂ ""demoralizing"" and disheartening."" Perhaps aware of reports that Trump nearly pulled Gorsuch's nomination out of personal pique, Kavanaugh was even more careful. Confronted several times by Trump's recent attack on the Justice Department for indicting two Republican congressmen, he said he must stay ""three Zip codes away from the line"" of political commentary.Â  Asked later to comment on Trump's attack during the 2016 presidential campaign on Associate Justice Ruth Bader GinsburgÂ â the president said ""her mind is shot"" after Ginsburg criticized himÂ â Kavanaugh said, ""I'm not going to get drawn into a political controversy."" Sens. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, Dick Durbin, D-Illinois, and Sheldon Whitehouse, D-Rhode Island, were among Democrats sharply questioning Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh at his confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee. (Photo: AP) More dangerous were the momentsÂ â and there were manyÂ â when Democrats linked Kavanaugh's strong support for a powerful presidency with the possibility that the Supreme Court will have to decide whether Trump can be subpoenaed, indicted or self-pardoned, or whether he can fire special counsel Robert Mueller.Â  ""It's in the context of the Trump presidency that we ask you these questions,"" Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Illinois, said.Â  Kavanaugh refused to answer the questions on the grounds that they were hypothetical and could come to the justices in the future. But standing accused of becoming Trump's hand-picked puppet on the court, he couldn't leave it there. âI am one not afraid at all, through my record of 12 years, to invalidate executive power,"" he said. The issue on virtually all senators' minds all week was abortion. Would Kavanaugh vote to overrule Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 decision that legalized abortion coast to coast? A simple yes-or-no answer would suffice. Of course, there would be no such answer. What Kavanaugh cited over and over was the importance â but not the inviolability â of Supreme Court precedent. And in this case, not just precedent but ""precedent on precedent""Â â the addition of the court's 1992 ruling in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, which upheld the right but allowed for state restrictions, such as requiring parental consent for minors. Parental consent is what led him to dissent last year when the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit allowed an undocumented teenager in federal custody to get an abortion. Kavanaugh said more time should have been allowed to find a sponsor, so the government would not be involved. ""I made it clear it had to happen very quickly,"" he said, so that the anonymous 17-year-old from Central America wouldn't bump up against Texas' 20-week limit. He noted he did not agree with a fellow judge who wrote that illegal immigrants lack abortion rights. ""I did the best I could,"" he said. Angry protesters interrupted Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation hearing for four days to vent their grievances over potential changes for abortion rights, health care, gun control and other issues. (Photo: Getty Images) On other issues that galvanized protesters â gun control, health care and voting rights among themÂ â Kavanaugh pointed to the kinder, gentler rhetoric in his opinions that nevertheless went against liberals' interests. His dissent that would have struck down a District of Columbia ban on semi-automaticÂ  weapons? Required by precedent, Kavanaugh said, but ""the violence in the schools is something we all detest."" His dissent in a case upholding the Affordable Care Act? Just for procedural reasons, he said, and âI expressed my respect for the congressional goal in that legislation.â His opinion upholding a photo ID law in South Carolina? ItÂ allowed for exceptions and was delayed for a year so that those affected could prepare, he said, adding, ""I was all over the real-world effects."" Sen. Kamala Harris, D-California, a former prosecutor, had some of the sharpest questions for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh at his Senate Judiciary Committee hearing. (Photo: EPA-EFE) The most unusual moment came late Wednesday night when Sen. Kamala Harris, D-CaliforniaÂ â one of five former prosecutors among the committee's 10 DemocratsÂ â asked if he had discussed the Mueller investigation with any lawyers from a firm headed byÂ Marc Kasowitz, one of Trump's many former lawyers.Â  ""Be careful with your answer, sir,"" Harris intoned, perhapsÂ causing Kavanaugh to do just that. He acknowledged talking about the case with fellow judges but said he didn't know who the senator had in mind. ""I think you're thinking of someone, and you don't want to tell us,"" she said. But the encounter ended in a stand-off, and by Thursday Kavanaugh had refreshed his memory enough to deny her chargeÂ â one apparently intended to force a Justice Kavanaugh to recuse himself from a potential futureÂ case.Â  ""I've had no inappropriate discussions with anyone,"" he told Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Connecticut. Later, he added, ""Iâve had no discussions of the kind that I think youâre asking about.â And, ultimately to Harris, he said, ""The answer's no.""

Dean had a massive role in the Watergate scandal, and his cooperation with prosecutors eventually led to Nixon's resignation from the White House.

The witness list also includes a student who survived the high school shooting in Parkland, Florida,Â and former Solicitor General Theodore Olson.Â  The testimony of the student,Â Aalayah Eastmond, likely will revolve around gun control and the movement started after the February shooting that left 17 people dead.Â Kavanaugh has written extensively about his support of gun rights and religious freedoms.Â  Olson served as solicitor general in the George W.

But Democrats and Republicans alike believe the verdict is already in. Barring a bad performance, Kavanaugh’s confirmation to be the next Supreme Court justice appears all but assured. That’s because Republicans can push through his nomination with a simple majority, so long as their caucus holds together. And despite Democrats’ best efforts, there’s little evidence they’ve been able to persuade any GOP senators to vote against him. “There’s no procedural silver bullet to any of this,” says a Senate Democratic aide. “The only way to defeat Brett Kavanaugh is to flip votes.” Not that they haven’t tried. Democrats have spent the summer fighting mightily to derail Kavanaugh’s nomination. Outside groups have funneled time and money into probing his record from the White House and his writings as a judge. Activists have held protests. And Senate Democrats have assailed Kavanaugh’s record on issues like abortion, healthcare and executive power. Democrats have painted Kavanaugh, who worked as a lawyer in George W. Bush’s White House and as a member of Kenneth Starr’s independent counsel investigation of President Bill Clinton, as a partisan who would roll back Roe v. Wade and shape the court through his expansive views of executive power. “I don’t have any doubt where he comes down on these issues,” Illinois Senator Dick Durbin, a member of the Judiciary Committee and the number two Democrat in the Senate, tells TIME. “With all due respect, Judge Kavanaugh speaks fluent Republican.” Read More: Inside Trump’s Plan to Dramatically Reshape U.S. Courts The Democratic minority has focused much of its efforts on senators Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, two moderate Republicans who support abortion rights. Neither woman has announced which way she plans to vote on Kavanaugh. But Collins said she had an “excellent session” with him when they met in August and that he told her he believes Roe v. Wade is “settled law.” Murkowski said she hasn’t seen anything in Kavanaugh’s record she would consider disqualifying, CNN reports. Both Collins and Murkowski voted for Trump’s first Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch last year. With limited power and long odds, Democrats are gearing up to grill Kavanaugh this week, hoping he’ll stumble. “I think the Democrats realize the only way they’re going to be able to stop him is if there were some sort of explosive thing” to come out during the hearings, says Carrie Severino, chief counsel and policy director of the conservative group Judicial Crisis Network. As Democrats attacked Kavanaugh, conservative groups launched a forceful campaign to shape voter perceptions of the judge, who has sat on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals since 2006. Judicial Crisis Network has spent $4.3 million to support Kavanaugh’s nomination, running ads on Fox, MSNBC and CNN. That’s more than Democratic counterparts, like the progressive judicial advocacy group Alliance for Justice, have been able to spend. “They’re willing to put up millions of dollars in order to get their judges confirmed,” marvels Nan Aron, president of Alliance for Justice. “Putting judges and justices on the bench is one thing [President Trump] can offer to the right-wing base of his party.” There’s some evidence that the Left’s campaign against Kavanaugh is working. A CNN poll from August found that just 37% of Americans want the Senate to confirm him, the lowest public support for a Supreme Court nominee since Robert Bork’s nomination by President Ronald Reagan in 1987. Republicans say the opposition has been unfair. “I honestly think that they hate Trump so much that if Donald Trump nominated Barack Obama to sit on the Supreme Court, they’d struggle to be a ‘Yes’ with that as well,” says Antonia Ferrier, Staff Director for the Senate Republican Communications Center. But more importantly, Kavanaugh has maintained support among Republicans: 74% of them would still like to see Kavanaugh confirmed, according to the same poll. Read More: The Era of the Swing Justice Is Over. Here’s How Democrats May Adapt As Democrats hammer Kavanaugh on his record, they’re also fighting the process. Kavanaugh has a longer paper trail than most other Supreme Court nominees in history, working for years in Bush’s White House counsel’s office and then as staff secretary, a key position that oversees the flow of all documents to the President. The vast trove of papers from Kavanaugh’s three years as staff secretary won’t be made public before the hearings. While Democrats complain that the Senate Judiciary Committee has received just 6% of documents from Kavanaugh’s time in the White House, Republicans note that the more than 200,000 pages from Kavanaugh’s government work mark a new record for Supreme Court confirmations. 200k pages of Kavanaughs govt work r now public Thats new record for public docs in SCOTUS confirmation HISTORY My staff will finish reviewing all docs received well ahead of public hearing Sept4 /Thats TRANSPARENCY — ChuckGrassley (@ChuckGrassley) August 24, 2018  Democrats have called for the release of more documents and asked to delay the hearings until they’re available. “There is this determination now that hell or high water we’re going to go forward with this Kavanaugh nomination and do it as fast as possible,” says Durbin. He and the nine other Democratic members of the Judiciary Committee all signed a letter registering their opposition to the process. But Republican leadership won’t budge. “Unfortunately, some have tried to criticize what is the most transparent confirmation process in history,” Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley said on Aug. 16. “But they’re failing. And they’re failing because Democratic leaders have made their true goal obvious: stall the confirmation as long as possible in the hope that Democrats take over the Senate in the midterm elections.” Democrats bear some of the blame for their own powerlessness. Democratic Senate Leader Harry Reid began to erode the rules surrounding judicial nominations when he eliminated the filibuster on all presidential nominees—except those to the Supreme Court— in 2013. In March 2016, Republicans took it to another level when they refused to hold hearings to confirm Judge Merrick Garland, President Obama’s nominee to fill Justice Antonin Scalia’s Supreme Court seat. Senate Republicans said they wouldn’t hold a hearing for Garland because it was Obama’s last year in office. After they refused to consider Garland, Trump won the presidency and nominated conservative judge Neil Gorsuch to fill the seat instead. Traditionally, Supreme Court confirmations had required some measure of bipartisan consensus to clear a 60-vote threshold, but with Democrats still furious over Garland, in 2017 Republicans invoked the same so-called nuclear option Reid had five years prior, this time for Supreme Court nominees. They confirmed Gorsuch with a simple majority. “Majorities in the Senate matter more than they ever did before with regard to the issue of judicial selection and confirmation,” says Leonard Leo, who advises Trump on judicial selections. Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell have used the majority to great effect, filling 60 judgeships so far in the President’s term. That’s more than Bush and Obama combined had appointed at the same point in theirs, according to Pew Research Center. And if they confirm Kavanaugh, it will cement a conservative majority on the nation’s highest court for decades.",0.08,0.806,0.114,0.9936,0.46187639380821194

    Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh is declining to answer questions about the extent of the president's pardon power. (Sept. 5)
    AP President Donald Trump's Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, a federal appeals court judge, holds up a worn copy of the Constitution of the United States as he testifies before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington, Wednesday, Sept. 5, 2018, for the second day of his confirmation to replace retired Justice Anthony Kennedy. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik) ORG XMIT: DCAH120(Photo: Andrew Harnik, AP) WASHINGTON â Brett Kavanaugh steered a narrow courseÂ toward confirmation to the Supreme Court Thursday, sidestepping tough questions from Democrats about President Donald Trump's myriad controversies and a Senate battle over documents withheld from his years in George W. Bush's White House. The multiple challenges facing Trump's nomineeÂ â including the third day of sudden outbursts from angry protestersÂ â did little to slow his progress toward becoming the ninth and decisive vote on the high court. The Trump administration released a statement late Thursday night praising Kavanaugh's performance during the hearings and saying the White House looks forward to his nomination being advanced.Â  âOver the past three days, Judge Kavanaugh demonstrated exactly why President Trump nominated him to the Supreme Court,""Â White House Spokesman Raj Shah said in the statement. ""His fidelity to the Constitution, impeccable qualifications, and extraordinary temperament were on full display for the American people to see."" Democrats who had sought to adjourn the hearing before it began appeared resigned to his ascendance. Before Thursday's session even got underway, they vowed to publicize documents that shed light on Kavanaugh's previously stated views aboutÂ abortion and racial profiling. Not even their repeated efforts to get Kavanaugh, a defender of presidential powers, to comment onÂ investigations swirling around the president himself knocked him off his game. They raised Trump's attacks on the Justice Department and special counsel Robert Mueller's probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 election, but to no avail. Time and again, the 53-year-old federal appeals court judge sidestepped invitations to criticize the president, saying he wanted to stay at least ""three zip codes away from the political arena."" Perhaps recognizing that Kavanaugh's confirmation appears inevitable, Democrats asked him whether he has discussed the Mueller investigation with anyone from a law firm headed by one of Trump's lawyersÂ â talks that could taint his independence in a future Supreme Court case.Â  ""I've had no inappropriate discussions with anyone,"" Kavanaugh said as he approached 20 hours of exhausting testimony over two days. Later told by Sen. Kamala Harris, D-California, that his response sounded equivocal, he added, ""The answer's no."" Sen. Cory Booker, D-New Jersey, said it appears that Kavanaugh was nominated to protect Trump if a case involving him comes to the court. Because of that, Booker said, he should recuse himself from any case involving the president. Kavanaugh said recusing in advance would be the same as tipping his hand in advance on a case not yet before the court.Â  Democrats have said Kavanaugh's nomination is more fraught with controversy than others because of Trump's authoritarian instincts as presidentÂ â ""not a particular case, but a particular moment in history,"" Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Illinois, said.  In response, Kavanagh painted himself as willing to stand up to any president. âI am one not afraid at all, through my record of 12 years, to invalidate executive power,"" Kavanaugh said. When a court blocks a president's action, he said, ""that is the final word."" The third day of the confirmation hearing began with a bitter dispute over documents. Democrats have complained about getting none for three years of Kavanaugh's career,Â when he served as White HouseÂ staff secretary. On Thursday they focused on 190,000 pages released to the Senate but withheld from public release. At the start of the day, Booker threatened to flout Senate protocol and release an email elucidating Kavanaugh's views on racial profiling. Republicans beat him to it, releasing a range of documents requested by Democrats. Another confidential email concerning abortion was leakedÂ to The New York Times. It showedÂ that in 2003Â as aÂ White House associate counsel, Kavanaugh saidÂ some legal scholars did not consider the right to abortion, legalized by the Supreme Court in 1973 and reiterated in 1992,Â ""settled law."" He stuck by that description during his confirmation hearing, calling the high court's abortion rights jurisprudence ""precedent on precedent"" but not settled law. By contrast, he applied the latter term to Brown v. Board of Education, which struck down school segregation. The judge stands weeks away from being confirmed to replace Justice Anthony Kennedy, whose votes most often decided 5-4 cases for more than a decade. The four-day confirmationÂ hearing is scheduled to conclude Friday, with committee and full Senate votes coming later this month. Republicans have a 51-49 Senate majority. Thus far, no Republicans have opposed Kavanaugh's nomination, and no Democrats have supported it. As the hearing wore on late Thursday, protesters sporadically shouted grievances from the back of the room, briefly interrupting the process. The catcalls likely shocked current and former members of Kavanaugh's Catholic Youth Organization basketball teams, arrayed behind him. ""They're getting an introduction to democracy,"" he said.Â  More:Â Kavanaugh claims independence in hearing More: Five reasons Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court is controversial More: Brett Kavanaugh is President Trump's nominee for the Supreme Court A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

Kavanaugh released a new statement calling the allegation “completely false” and saying he “had no idea who was making this accusation until she identified herself” on Sunday to The Washington Post. “I am willing to talk to the Senate Judiciary Committee in any way the Committee deems appropriate to refute this false allegation, from 36 years ago, and defend my integrity,” Kavanaugh said. Kavanaugh, meanwhile, was seen arriving at the White House late Monday morning. There was no immediate explanation of the reason for his visit. He had been on a smooth confirmation track, but the new allegations have roiled that process. Republican senators have expressed concern over a woman’s private-turned-public allegation that a drunken Kavanaugh groped her and tried to take off her clothes at a party when they were teenagers. Debra S. Katz, the attorney for the woman, Christine Blasey Ford, said her client considered the incident to be an attempted rape. “She believes that if were not for the severe intoxication of Brett Kavanaugh, she would have been raped,” Katz told NBC’s “Today.” Kavanaugh, 53, “categorically and unequivocally” denied the allegations when they came out anonymously last week. “This has not changed,” said White House spokesman Kerri Kupec on Monday. “Judge Kavanaugh and the White House both stand by that statement.” Still, White House counselor Kellyanne Conway said of Ford: “She should not be insulted. She should not be ignored. She should testify under oath and she should do it on Capitol Hill.” Conway, who said she had discussed the situation with President Donald Trump, said that both Ford and Kavanaugh should testify, but made clear it was up to the Judiciary Committee. She said Sen. Lindsey Graham had told her it could happen as soon as Tuesday and the White House will “respect the process.” Stressing that Kavanaugh had already testified and undergone FBI background checks, Conway said: “I think you have to weigh this testimonial evidence from Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh along with the considerable body of evidence that is already there about the judge’s temperament and qualifications and character.” In morning television interviews, Katz said her client was willing to tell her story in public to the Judiciary panel, although no lawmakers or their aides had yet contacted her. Katz also denied that Ford, a Democrat, is politically motivated. “No one in their right mind regardless of their motives would want to inject themselves into this process and face the kind of violation that she will be subjected to by those who want this nominee to go though. … She was quite reluctant to come forward.” Initially the sexual misconduct allegation was conveyed in a private letter, without revealing Ford’s name. With a name and disturbing details, the accusation raised the prospect of congressional Republicans defending Trump’s nominee ahead of midterm elections featuring an unprecedented number of female candidates and informed in part by the #MeToo movement. Ford told the Post that Kavanaugh pinned her to a bed at a Maryland party in the early 1980s, clumsily tried to remove her clothing and put his hand over her mouth when she tried to scream. She said Kavanaugh and a friend — both “stumbling drunk,” she says — corralled her in a bedroom when she was around 15 and Kavanaugh was around 17. She says Kavanaugh groped her over her clothes, grinded his body against hers and tried to take off her one-piece swimsuit and the outfit she wore over it. Kavanaugh covered her mouth with his hand when she tried to scream, she says, and escaped when the friend, Mark Judge, jumped on them. Kavanaugh attended a private school for boys in Maryland while Ford attended a nearby school. A split seemed to be emerging among the GOP. The GOP-controlled Judiciary Committee has previously scheduled a Thursday vote on whether to recommend approval of Kavanaugh’s nomination in the full Senate. Democrats, led by Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York, called for a delay in the vote, and two committee Republicans — all 11 on the GOP side are men — Sens. Jeff Flake of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, said they wanted to hear more from Ford. Flake went as far as to say he was “not comfortable” voting for Kavanaugh for the time being. A potential “no” vote from Flake would complicate the judge’s prospects. A Republican not on the committee, Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee, said the vote should be postponed until the committee heard from Ford. Contacted Sunday by CNN, Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, wouldn’t say if the vote should be postponed. A committee spokesman said late Sunday that its chairman, Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, was trying to arrange separate, follow-up calls with Kavanaugh and Ford, but just for aides to Grassley and Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., before Thursday’s scheduled vote. Critics have already accused the GOP of fast-tracking the process to get Kavanaugh on the court by Oct. 1, the first day of the fall term. The allegation against Kavanaugh first came to light late last week in the form of a letter that had been for some time in the possession of Feinstein, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee and one of its four female members. On Sunday, The Washington Post published an interview with Ford. “I thought he might inadvertently kill me,” said Ford, 51, a clinical psychology professor at Palo Alto University in California. “He was trying to attack me and remove my clothing.” In the interview, Ford says she never revealed what had happened to her until 2012, when she and her husband sought couples therapy. Ford’s husband, Russell Ford, said he recalled his wife using Kavanaugh’s last name and expressing concern that Kavanaugh — then a federal judge — might someday be nominated to the Supreme Court. Senate Republicans, along with the White House, see no need to postpone voting over what they consider uncorroborated and unverifiable accusations, according to a person familiar with the situation but not authorized to speak publicly. In considering their options Sunday, Republicans largely settled on the view that Ford’s story alone was not enough to delay Kavanaugh’s confirmation. Grassley could invite Ford to testify, likely in closed session before Thursday. Kavanaugh would also probably be asked to appear before senators. The panel would also likely seek testimony from Judge, Kavanaugh’s friend and classmate who Ford says jumped on top of her. Judge has denied that the incident happened. Republicans have not settled on the strategy, the person familiar with the situation said, but were weighing options, including doing nothing. Republicans say the allegations have already cast a shadow over Kavanaugh but that it does not appear to be enough to change the votes in the narrowly divided 51-49 Senate. Key will be the views of Collins and Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. Both are under enormous pressure from outside groups who want them to oppose Kavanaugh on grounds that as a justice he could vote to undercut the Roe v. Wade ruling legalizing abortion in the U.S. The White House has accused Feinstein of mounting an “11th hour attempt to delay his confirmation.” The White House has also sought to cast doubt about Ford’s allegation by noting that the FBI has repeatedly investigated Kavanaugh since the 1990s for highly sensitive positions he has held, including in the office of independent counsel Ken Starr, at the White House and his current post on the federal appeals court in Washington. Sixty-five women who knew Kavanagh in high school defended him in a separate letter, circulated by Senate Judiciary Committee Republicans, as someone who “always treated women with decency and respect.”",0.072,0.869,0.059,-0.9562,0.4432376857376857

I had no idea that, in the blink of an eye, I had lost both my legs when a grenade tore through the helicopter I was piloting just north of Baghdad. It took me days to recognize the reality of my disability, months to learn how to walk again and years to get used to the constant, hammering pain that’s still there, even when I’m just sitting down. Despite it all, I consider myself pretty lucky — not only because of the fantastic medical team that helped me recover and the VA care I still receive today, but also because I am an American with disabilities, which means the Americans with Disabilities Act is in place to safeguard the basic rights I rely on to lead a full life. The rights that activists with disabilities fought so hard for, for so long. That they left their wheelchairs and crawled up the Capitol steps for. The rights that thankfully, finally, got enshrined into law in 1990. That isn’t to say there aren’t still struggles, and we still have a long way to go to achieve true equality. Nearly three decades after the ADA became law, far too many public places continue to be inaccessible and difficult to navigate. On every issue — including transportation, housing, education, health care and employment opportunities — we’re still working hard toward the goal of ensuring that Americans with disabilities are able to live independently in their communities. But even so, it’s hard to imagine the exhaustion and frustration that Americans with disabilities must’ve felt every day in the years before the ADA became law — when our country openly and unabashedly discriminated against our entire community. And I worry that rather than making progress, the hellish, relentless discrimination of pre-ADA America could become a reality once again for me and for millions of other people with disabilities if Judge Brett Kavanaugh is confirmed to the Supreme Court. Judge Kavanaugh has shown us what he believes about disabled Americans. In Tarlow v. D.C., he ruled that those with mental disabilities shouldn’t have the right to make medical decisions about their own bodies. In Baloch v. Kempthorne, he declared that businesses’ profits are more important than our health. And in Johnson v. Interstate Management Company, he decided that it’s okay for employers to discriminate against us, too. The cases are different, the plaintiffs change, but one fact remains the same: Judge Kavanaugh’s rulings make clear that he’s just not concerned whether we’re able to go to school, get decent health care, eat at a restaurant like anyone else or even earn a livable wage. Well, I am. And I’m going to fight as hard as I can these next few weeks to make sure that our next Supreme Court justice isn’t someone who thinks we’re less worthy of our rights than able-bodied Americans. But I can’t do it alone, which is why I’m so lucky to have the disability community at my side, pushing to expand access and protect our rights against attacks from Donald Trump, the Republicans and Judge Kavanaugh. The disability community proved the power that it wields during last year’s fight to protect the Affordable Care Act. It proved that power again when it helped me lead a group of 43 Senators to block Republican efforts to roll back ADA protections and reward businesses who’ve failed to comply with the law after nearly 30 years. And when it comes to Judge Kavanaugh, we need to show that same strength 10 times over. Because it’s not “just” our health care on the line in this fight — though that’s at stake too, as his record suggests that he’d vote to take away protections for people with pre-existing conditions. Our civil and voting rights are also on the line, as cases rise through the courts that would make it harder for Americans with disabilities to participate in the democratic process and vote. Women’s rights are on the line, as the judge has previously sided against expanding health care access to more women—and would likely be the deciding vote to repeal or roll back Roe v. Wade, putting the government in between women and their doctors. Immigrants’ rights are on the line. As are LGBTQ rights. As is our economic security and our kids’ future. Our public schools and our planet, too. Every issue is a disability issue, because our community — at 60 million strong — is beautifully diverse. That’s a gift, but also a responsibility. Because it means we have to fight for every American with disabilities, whether they’re undocumented or disenfranchised or sick and in need of care. No matter what. Truthfully, this confirmation process isn’t really about whether some judge can sit in fancy robes in a courtroom in D.C. This is about our most basic rights. And there are only a few weeks left to stop a confirmation that could change our lives forever. So from this moment until the final vote is cast, I’m going to be fighting right alongside every other activist with a disability. Working together. Speaking as one. Proving the power of a community that only grows stronger every time someone like Brett Kavanaugh tries to strip us of our rights.",0.083,0.777,0.14,0.9958,0.4585123886953155

Jon Tester, a top GOP target in the fall elections. Trump also raised the specter of impeachment if Democrats win control of Congress. As he stood alongside Tester’s opponent, state Auditor Matt Rosendale, Trump said Tester “will never drain the swamp because he happens to live in the swamp.” Seeking to portray the Montana farmer as a tool of liberal Democrats, Trump said, “Jon Tester talks like he’s from Montana, but he votes like he’s Nancy Pelosi” — a reference to the House minority leader, a frequent Trump target. Trump said many of the Senate Democrats whom Tester had helped elect “are attacking Judge Kavanaugh and looking like fools.” He said Kavanaugh — who is strongly opposed by Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee — deserved “overwhelming bipartisan support.” “It’s embarrassing to watch those people make fools of themselves as they scream and shout at this great gentleman,” Trump said after three days of committee hearings on the nomination. The president’s strategy on the Supreme Court nomination aims to turn the screws on Tester and Sen. Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, where Trump planned to appear Friday. Both red-state Democrats find themselves caught between their Senate leaders and their states’ more conservative voters, who are more broadly supportive of Trump’s pick. Neither senator has laid down clear markers on how they will vote on Kavanaugh’s nomination, which Senate Republican leaders hope to bring to a floor vote later this month — just weeks before the Nov. 6 general election. White House officials contend the Supreme Court was a powerful motivator for Republican base voters in 2016, when Trump won the White House, and they’re seeking to capitalize on Kavanaugh’s nomination to help overcome an enthusiasm gap with Democrats. Likewise, a vote for Kavanaugh by either Tester or Heitkamp could frustrate a Democratic base eager for a more confrontational approach to the Trump administration. Democrats question whether the Kavanaugh vote will resonate in the race to unseat Tester. He has emphasized his independence and willingness to cross the aisle to work with Trump, who carried Montana by 20 percentage points two years ago. “It’s not like you’re standing in the grocery store line and people are talking about the Kavanaugh confirmation. It’s pretty inside baseball for folks,” said Barrett Kaiser, a Montana-based Democratic strategist. Kaiser said Tester had demonstrated a “proven bipartisan record of working with this administration when it helps Montana and oppose them when it doesn’t.” Tester opposed Trump’s first Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch, and the Republican tax bill, but took flak from the left for supporting a bill easing the rules on banks. He has a television ad promoting his collaboration with Trump as he seeks to inoculate himself against conservative critics. Likewise, Heitkamp is locked in a tough re-election fight in heavily Republican North Dakota, where she narrowly won six years ago and now faces a more formidable opponent in Rep. Kevin Cramer. Cramer has been a fervent supporter of Trump, who remains popular in North Dakota. During the rally, Trump claimed Democrats would “hurt” Social Security and “kill” Medicare. Trump promised during his 2016 campaign that he would save those programs. Trump also warned that a Democratic-controlled Congress would pursue impeachment despite the strong economy and set a precedent that would hurt future presidents. A few Democratic lawmakers have called for Trump to be removed from office. “Let’s say a Democrat gets elected and let’s say we have a Republican House. We will impeach that Democrat, right?” Trump said. “You’re going to have a country that’s going to turn into a third-world country because if the opposite party becomes president, every time before it even starts, before you even found out whether or not he or she is going to do a great job, they’ll say, ‘We want to impeach him!'” “If it does happen, it’s your fault because you didn’t go out to vote,” Trump said. Trump also lit into Tester for his role in torpedoing Trump’s nomination of Ronny Jackson to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs. Earlier this year, Tester released unsubstantiated, anonymous allegations against Jackson that accused him of on-the-job drunkenness, overprescribing medication and fostering a hostile work environment. Jackson, a Navy rear admiral who was Trump’s personal physician, denied the claims and eventually withdrew his nomination. “What Tester did to Admiral Jackson should never, ever be allowed,” Trump said, calling the allegations “lies.”",0.064,0.775,0.161,0.9981,0.4861973775017253

    During today's Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh said he would ""keep an open mind on every case.""
    USA TODAY A woman stands and voices her opposition to Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, during a Senate Judiciary Committee confirmation hearing on his nomination for Supreme Court, on Capitol Hill, Tuesday, Sept. 4, 2018, in Washington.  (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin) ORG XMIT: DCJM101(Photo: Jacquelyn Martin, AP) WASHINGTONÂ â The first day of confirmation hearings for Brett KavanaughÂ â President Donald Trump's nominee for the Supreme CourtÂ â quickly lurched out of control Tuesday with screaming protesters and senators who refused to stick to the 10-minute timeline for their partisan speeches. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, vowed to take charge of the hearings on Wednesday when senators get a chance to start questioning Kavanaugh in a grueling session that is expected to last at least 12 hours. Here's a look at some of the highlights of Tuesday's session and what to expect on Wednesday: A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.  The first 90 minutes of the hearing were taken up by dozens of protesters interrupting the proceedings by yelling out anti-Kavanaugh slogans. At the same time,Â Democratic members made a last-ditch effort to postpone the hearing to give them time to review a mountain of documents about Kavanaugh and to demand more. The protesters were removed from the hearing room by Capitol Police, and attempts by Democrats to delay the proceedings failed when Grassley ruled them out of order. Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, the second-highest-ranking Republican in the Senate, dubbed the raucous scene ""mob rule."" Democrats said the hearing should be delayed until they receiveÂ all of the documents from Kavanaugh's three-year tenure as staff secretary for former President George W. Bush. The White House has withheld more than 100,000 pages based on claims of executive privilege. DemocratsÂ also complained that Republicans dumped 45,000 documents on the committee the night before the hearing, giving senators little time to review them. WASHINGTON, DC - SEPTEMBER 04:  Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh is greeted by committee chairman Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) as Kavanaugh arrives for testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee during his Supreme Court confirmation hearing in the Hart Senate Office Building on Capitol Hill September 4, 2018 in Washington, DC. Kavanaugh was nominated by President Donald Trump to fill the vacancy on the court left by retiring Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy.  (Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images) ORG XMIT: 775208795 ORIG FILE ID: 1026649294 (Photo: Win McNamee, Getty Images) But Grassley said the committee has already received 483,000Â pages of records from Kavanaugh's time working in the White House counsel's office during the Bush administration. About 300,000 pages were posted on the committee's website for public review, while the remainder were restricted to senators. ""The American people haveÂ unprecedented accessÂ and more materials to review for Judge Kavanaugh than they ever had for a Supreme Court nominee,"" Grassley said in refusing to delay the hearing. After a day filled with lengthy speeches from the 21 senators on the Judiciary Committee, Kavanaugh had a chance to introduce himself to the public as he read his introductory statement. More:Â Parkland victim's father tries to shake Brett Kavanaugh's hand Kavanaugh's comments were the least controversial of the hearing.Â When it was finally his turn to speak, Kavanaugh told senators that, if confirmed to the high court, he wouldÂ be a legal ""umpire"" who would not choose sides ahead of time. ""I donât decide cases based on personal or policy preferences.Â I am not a pro-plaintiff or pro-defendant judge.Â I am not a pro-prosecution or pro-defense judge,"" Kavanaugh said. ""I am a pro-law judge."" Senators told Kavanaugh some of the top issues that they will bring up when they get a chance to begin questioning him on Wednesday. Both Republican Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona and Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut said they plan to ask Kavanaugh questions about his views on presidential power and the limits of that power. ""I want to know where you think executive powers begin and end,"" Flake told Kavanaugh, who is currently a federal appeals court judge. Blumenthal said the issue is especially important since Kavanaugh could be the deciding vote on whether or not special counsel Robert Mueller can indict Trump or compel him to testify as part of the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. ""Your responses to our questions will be highly enlightening about whether you join us in defending the Department of Justice and the rule of law,""Â Blumenthal said Democrats also indicated that they will ask the judge about his views on abortion rights, gun control, civil rights, and healthcare. The committee expects the hearing to last at least 12 hours, and possibly longer. Each of the 21 senators will get 30 minutes to ask questions of Kavanaugh, whose ability to survive the endurance contest is a key test of whether he will be confirmed. If Kavanaugh is like most recent nominees, he will answer the questions cautiously and try to avoid saying how he would rule on a particular issue.

""Save Roe, vote no!"" one woman yells. Another woman, wearing a red bandannaÂ in the style of Rosie the Riveter, joins her: ""Health care is a human right!"" The rows of reporters, typing feverishly on their laptops, lookÂ up. Senators stopÂ midsentence. Officers lined against the walls of the chamber pounceÂ on the women, dragging them out of the large wood-paneled room.Â  This isn't chaos, though. It is a highly organized effort to disrupt and delay the confirmation hearings for Brett Kavanaugh, the presidentâs choice for the U.S. Supreme Court. ""CancelÂ Kavanaugh!""Â Phoebe Hopps, president and founder of Women's March Michigan, chanted at Wednesday's hearing before being dragged out of the chamber and arrested with other protesters.Â  She couldn't stay in her home in the northwestern Michigan town of Kewadin whileÂ the Senate spent last week considering Kavanaugh for a seat on the highest court in the nation.Â  A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.  ""I told my husband that I had to get to D.C.Â because I knew what was on the line,"" said Hopps. ""I used my airline (frequent flier) miles.

The Womenâs March organizers are a steady force, a persistent group that while doesnât always gain national exposure for its efforts, has kept up pressure on Republicans and their conservative agenda. Even if they've been unable to alter the conservative path completely,Â theyâve made it clear theyâre not going away as they find new and different ways to voice their often loud objections. Some of the same individuals rallied against the separation of immigration families at the border. They helped young students organize massive rallies to counter gun laws. They rose up against the president'sÂ travel ban and helped boost women nominees in political races across the nation. They held gatherings in support of women's reproductive rights and access to health care.Â  A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

It took one single enormous act for all of us to wake up âÂ President Trump in the White House,"" said Alex Dodds, 34.Â  Dodds attended the first Women's March event in 2017 and helped formÂ aÂ local groupÂ in the Washington area to keep up pressure on the Trump administration.Â She rallied againstÂ Kavanaugh this week and said his nomination could be one of the most long-lasting and encapsulating decisions the Trump administration and Republicans would make.Â  ""I think we've learned there are a lot of intersections of issues, whether it be women's health to immigration to guns, and Kavanaugh will have a huge deciding factor on all of them,"" she said.Â  It seems at every turn, the Women's March organization has taken a stand against the Trump administration's controversial policies, sometimes headlining events and other times backing up or partnering with other activist groups in an attempt to slow or place a roadblock on the president's agenda.Â  Women's reproductive rights activists that oppose the nomination of circuit judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, protest Sept. 7, 2018, outside Senate Judiciary Committee's confirmation hearing on Kavanaugh in Washington. (Photo: MICHAEL REYNOLDS, EPA-EFE) More: Parkland shooting survivor gives powerful testimony at Kavanaugh hearings More: Analysis: What Cory Booker's 'Spartacus' moment at the Kavanaugh hearing accomplished More: Brett Kavanaugh: Most dramatic moments from Supreme Court confirmation hearings Women's March organizers paired with students in Parkland, Florida,Â and across the nation after the February high school shooting, which killed 17 people, and assisted in planningÂ both theÂ school walkout protests and the March for Our Lives rallies.Â  ""We played a very strong role in organizing and mobilizing youth across the country and in fact from there, in the aftermath of that launch, we put out a call and said, 'Hey, who wants to start a youth chapter?"" said Rachel O'Leary Carmona, chief operating officer of Womenâs March National. About 170 local Youth Empower chapters were formed after that with an aim to register voters and create transformative social change in neighborhoods across the nation.Â  It's not always marches. Sometimes the group creates letter writing campaigns or takes over a lawmakers office. Other times, like duringÂ theÂ Kavanaugh hearings, it's showingÂ civil disobedience and getting arrested.Â  ""Itâs a spectrum and itâs a tactic and itâs one that we have deemed necessary because of the serious encroachments on civil and human rights that the Trump administration has performed,"" O'Leary Carmona said.Â  She added the first march started a movement that has grown over time into an intricate network, many might call its members part of the ""resistance."" ""ThereÂ are people all across the country and in fact all across the world who are working in collaboration to move the needle on issues that we articulated in our unity principles,"" she said. ""Itâs really easy to look at the headlines and say theyâre here and theyâre there and thereâs these big mobilizations, but our chapters are really building power and pushing work in communities all around the world.""Â  The group and those like it have become a thorn in the side of Republicans, including the president, who recently suggested in an interview that protesting should not be allowed at the hearing.Â  A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.  After seeing the protesters who gathered forÂ Kavanaugh's hearings, Trump told the Daily Caller, a conservative website: ""In the old days, we used to throw them out. Today, I guess they just keep screaming."" ""I donât know why they donât take care of a situation like that,"" Trump said. ""I think itâs embarrassing for the country to allow protesters. You donât even know what side the protesters are on."" But the Women's March organization has continued to attractÂ followers like Barbara Bearden, who was one of the many arrested throughout theÂ Kavanaugh protests.Â  Bearden yelled ""NO TRUMP PUPPET!"" before she was arrested by officers. She says the $35 fine and discomfort of being handcuffed were worth it to voice her opposition toÂ Kavanaugh's appointment.Â  Wearing a ""Be a Hero"" T-shirt outside the Hart building, Bearden said she didn't know whether the protests would change the minds of any lawmakers during the hearings, which are over for now. The committee is expected to vote on his nomination in two weeks, leaving time for a full Senate vote before the high courtâs 2018 term start on Oct. 1.Â  Still, Bearden refused to sit on the sidelines of history.Â  ""When I look back at this point, I don't want to remember watching the news and not doing everything in my power to stick up for my beliefs,""Â Bearden said. ""So no, I don't know my actions will change things, but I would rather fight tooth and bone than let these moments go by without trying.""

""Throughout his confirmation process, Judge Kavanaugh has had 65 meetings with senators—including with Senator Feinstein—sat through over 30 hours of testimony, addressed over 2,000 questions in a public setting and additional questions in a confidential session,"" Kupec told the White House pool. ""Not until the eve of his confirmation has Sen. Feinstein or anyone raised the specter of new 'information' about him.""   ""Throughout 25 years of public service, the Federal Bureau of Investigation has thoroughly and repeatedly vetted Judge Kavanaugh, dating back to 1993, for some of the most highly sensitive roles.

    USA TODAY Current Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, center, walks alongside independent counsel Ken Starr in 1997 during their investigation of President Bill Clinton.(Photo: Associated Press) WASHINGTON âÂ Twenty years ago this month, Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh urged fellow investigators in the independent counsel's office to ask President Bill Clinton extremely graphic questions about his affair with Monica Lewinsky. The point, Kavanaugh said, was to help Congress ""decide whether the interests of the presidency would be best served by having a new president."" While the general nature of Kavanaugh's memo was previously reported, the National Archives and Records Administration on Monday released the two-pagerÂ following a Freedom of Information Act request from the judicial transparency group Fix the Court. Kavanaugh wanted colleagues preparing to interview Clinton to ask about such details as oral sexÂ in the Oval Office, vaginal stimulation, masturbation and phone sex, all as a way of determining if the president would deny what Lewinsky had told investigators. ""The president has disgraced his office, the legal system, and the American people by having sex with a 22-year-old intern and turning her life into a shamblesÂ â callous and disgusting behavior that has somehow gotten lost in the shuffle,"" Kavanaugh wrote. Kavanaugh saw things differently when it came to issuing independent counsel Ken Starr's final report, urging that it not be so salacious. And more than a decade later, he wrote that presidents should be spared from responding to civil lawsuits or criminal investigations while in office.Â  ""A president who is concerned about an ongoing criminal investigation is almost inevitably going to do a worse job as president,"" he wrote in the Minnesota Law Review.

He praised Kavanaugh, saying he was “at a level that we rarely see,” but said he supported a review process in the Senate. Kavanaugh’s nomination has been threatened by a woman’s allegation that he sexually assaulted her when they were high schoolers. He has denied the charge. Kavanaugh and his accuser, Christine Blasely Ford, have both been asked to testify Monday, but it is not clear if Ford will appear.

    Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh says he believes the first thing that makes a good judge is ""independence."" Amid constant disruptions from protesters, Kavanaugh is answering questions in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee. (Sept. 5)
    AP Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh appears before the Senate Judiciary Committee during the first day of his confirmation hearing on Sept. 4,  2018.(Photo: Jack Gruber, USA TODAY) WASHINGTONÂ â Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh answered senators' questions Wednesday on high-profile issues ranging from abortion to gun control to presidential power. Kavanaugh, an appeals court judge nominated for the Supreme Court by President Donald Trump, refused to discuss hypothetical cases that he may have to help decide if he is confirmed. However, he told members of the Senate Judiciary Committee his views on some of the high court's most important cases. Here's a look at what the judge had to say on some of the most controversial issues: Kavanaugh could become the deciding vote on whether Trump can be indicted or forced to testify as part of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election. ""Can a sitting president be required to respond to a subpoena?"" Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., asked the judge.Â  Kavanaugh replied: ""I can't give you an answer on that hypothetical question."" He noted that Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and other justices â when they were nominees ârefused to answer hypothetical questions because they didn't want to prejudge future cases. However, Kavanaugh praised the Supreme Court's landmark 1974 decision in United States vs. Nixon. The court ruledÂ unanimously in that case that President Richard Nixon had to turn over tape recordings and other evidence related to the Watergate scandal. Kavanaugh called that ruling ""one of the greatest moments in Supreme Court history"" because the court stood up at a ""crisis moment"" and showed its independence. He refused to answer a question about whether the president can pardon himself, as Trump has said he has the right to do. Kavanaugh called itÂ a ""hypothetical question that I can't begin to answer in this context as a sitting judge and nominee."" A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.  Kavnaugh is a devout Catholic and some abortion rights advocates fear he mightÂ try to overturn Roe vs. Wade âÂ the landmark 1973 case that decided women have a constitutional right toÂ an abortion. ""It has been reported that you have said that Roe is now settled law,"" Feinstein said to the judge. ""What do you mean by settled law? Do you believe it is correct law?"" Kavanaugh said the case ""is an important precedent of the Supreme Court that has been reaffirmed many times."" He said the 1992 case of Planned Parenthood vs. Casey had created ""precedent upon precedent"" by clearly reaffirming Roe in ruling thatÂ ""matters, involving the most intimate and personal choices a person may make in a lifetime ... are central to the liberty protected by theÂ Fourteenth Amendment."" Kavanaugh also told Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, that ""my personal beliefs are not relevant to how I decide cases.""

    AP Kavanaugh defended his dissent in a key 2011 gun control case before the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The majority of judges upheld Washington, D.C.'s, gun registration law and its ban on semi-automatic weapons, which the city classified as assault weapons. Kavanaugh said he based his dissent on a Supreme Court ruling that ""dangerous and unusual weapons""Â â such as machine gunsÂ â could be banned. But he said he didn't see semi-automatic rifles as ""unusual."" ""Handguns and semi-automatic rifles are weapons used for hunting and self-defense,"" he said.

    Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh says the Court âmust never, never be viewed as a partisan institutionâ - a tacit response to Democratic fears he would be President Donald Trumpâs advocate on the high court. (Sept. 4)
    AP 9/4/18 4:53:46 PM -- Washington, DC, U.S.A  -- Supreme Court Associate Justice nominee Brett Kavanaugh appears before the Senate Judiciary Committee during his confirmation hearing on Sept. 4, 2018 in Washington. Kavanaugh was nominated by President Donald Trump to replace Justice Anthony Kennedy,who retired from the Supreme Court in July.  --    Photo by Jack Gruber, USA TODAY Staff ORG XMIT:  JG 137433 Kavanaugh Confir 9/4/2018 (Via OlyDrop)(Photo: Jack Gruber, USA TODAY) Supreme Court nomineeÂ Brett KavanaughÂ answered senators' questions Wednesday during his nomination hearing.Â  Day 2Â of Brett Kavanaughâs Supreme Court confirmation hearing has made clear that too many questions from his political operative days in the George W. Bush White House remain unanswered. We must know more about our Supreme Court nominees. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley refused calls to postpone the hearing and request millions of pages of Kavanaughâs record from his time in the Bush White House â meaning neither the Senate nor the public will see them. The questions from Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.,Â about Kavanaughâs involvement in controversial domestic surveillance programs and judicial nominations make this need for postponement even more urgent. For senators to carry out their solemn obligation faithfully, they must be given access to all relevant documents, including Kavanaughâs record as a high-profile political operative. Most important, the American people should see these records, as well. On hearing protestors: KavanaughÂ hearing protests are as American as apple pie Conservative view: Abortion rights advocates donât speak for all women on KavanaughâsÂ nomination There is simply too much at stake to allow a secretive, politicalÂ and incomplete process to continue â a process that has been shamefully flawed from the start. Grassley issued a partisan letter requesting a narrow set of Kavanaugh's White House records rather than a bipartisan request for the entire record â as called for by tradition. Only 7 percent of Kavanaughâs White House records have been sent to the Judiciary Committee. And only 4 percent are available to the public. None of these records comes from the National Archives. Rather, they come from Bill Burck, a Republican lawyer who happens to be Kavanaughâs former deputy and who has representedÂ Steve Bannon, Don McGahn, Reince PriebusÂ and Judge Alex Kozinski, Kavanaughâs former boss who retired last year following multiple accusations of sexual misconduct. It gets worse. Just last week, the Trump administration invoked executive privilege to withhold more than 100,000 documents from Kavanaughâs time in the White House. And on the night before the hearing, Burck dumped 42,000 pages of Kavanaughâs records, with virtually no time for the committee to thoroughly review and assess these records before the hearing started. What are they trying to hide? What we already know about Kavanaughâs judicial record is deeply troubling. His rulings suggest that if confirmed to the Supreme Court, he would lead efforts to limit access to health care, deny women the freedom to control their own bodies, undermine voting rights, disregard the interests of people with disabilities,Â and dramatically curtail protections for working people and the environment. Those are critical issues for the communities we represent and for the future of civil and human rights. And they are issues that undoubtedly will come before the Supreme Court. To make an informed decision, all 100 senators, and the millions of Americans they represent, need to see Kavanaugh's full White House record. And if they cannot, senators must vote to oppose Kavanaughâs confirmation. Too much is at stake to do otherwise. Lena Zwarensteyn is the fair courts campaign director at The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. You can folow her on Twitter: @lenazwarensteyn.Â  Qualified is in the eye of the beholder. It's obvious why President Donald Trump wants Brett Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court. Special counsel Robert Mueller is coming, and Kavanaugh has essentially said he believes that a president is above the law. â William Travis Whiny Democrats saidÂ they needed to passÂ the AffordableÂ Care Act without reading it. Now they demand thousands ofÂ documents from Kavanaugh's tenure at the George W. Bush White House;Â everyone in America knows they won't read them. â Craig Worrall I just watched two hours of the nomination hearing. Anytime a serious question was asked, Kavanaugh diverted and would not answer. When pressed, Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley jumped in and cried foul. This is a circus show being rammed down America's throat. Be honest and answer the questions, Kavanaugh. Is it really that hard? â Brian Mitrzyk Looks to me like DemocratsÂ are asking a lot of Trump-loaded questions, rather than questions about laws that affect average citizens. â Andy Rus Sherrilyn Ifill,Â  CNN.com: ""The ongoing investigation into President Donald Trump's conduct in the 2016 election is not just an inquiry into whether he or his associates committed crimes. It is a test of America's commitment to the basic principle that our justice system should treat every citizen equally. If the U.S. Senate is serious about upholding that principle, it will delay Judge Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court confirmation hearing until special counsel Robert Mueller has completed his investigation. If it does not, it risks tarnishing the Supreme Court and undermining the rule of law â blows from which our nation will not easily recover."" Emily BazelonÂ andÂ Eric Posner,Â  The New York Times: ""Judge Kavanaugh hasnât earned his originalist badge. Itâs being fixed to him to mask the fact that as an appeals court judge, he relentlessly pressed forward a Republican agenda favoring business and religious interests. ...Â If Judge Kavanaugh is confirmed, there will be only one dyed-in-the-wool originalist left among the justices â Clarence Thomas â who is also, at 70, the oldest member of the courtâs conservative wing. ... This shift away from originalism is a window into the conservative movementâs priorities as it prepares to lock in a five-member Supreme Court majority. Originalism is no longer the powerful tool it once was for advancing a conservative jurisprudence."" The Wall Street Journal,Â  editorial: ""The main charge is that Senate Judiciary Committee ChairmanÂ Chuck Grassley is 'denying'Â crucial documents to 'hide'Â Judge Kavanaughâs record. The senators are ignoring the 307 opinions he has written, and the 17,000 pages of material he provided in response to the committeeâs questionnaire â the most extensive ever demanded of a nominee. The senators have already received more than half a million pages about his time as a lawyer and judge â more documents than were provided for the past five Supreme Court nominees combined. Democrats havenât found a killer issue in all of this, so they are demanding documents from Judge Kavanaughâs time as a staff secretary in the Bush White House. The documents would reveal little about Judge Kavanaughâs legal thinking, since as staff secretary his job was to vet and monitor what President George W. Bush saw each day.""

    USA TODAY Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, here in Sen. Rob Portman's office, has met with 65 senators since his nomination to the Supreme Court.(Photo: AP) WASHINGTON âÂ For eight weeks since President Donald Trump nominated him for the swing seat on the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh's judicial record and legal philosophy has gottenÂ lost amid disputes over his partisan past and withheld documents. But when the Senate Judiciary Committee holds four days of hearings this week, those controversies probably will take a back seat to issuesÂ affecting millions of Americans: Abortion. Guns. Health care. And, inevitably, the president himself. Kavanaugh, 53, will be questioned for 17 hours or more about the conservative views he espoused in more than 300 opinions and dissents over 12 years on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia CircuitÂ â a traditional  steppingstone to the Supreme Court.Â  For half that time, Republicans who have fawned over Kavanaugh since his nomination July 9 will call attention to his pedigree and character: Yale University and Yale Law School, three prestigious federal court clerkships, nearly a decade of public serviceÂ and a reputation for open-mindedness and collegiality. Explainer: Five reasons Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court is controversial For the other half, Democrats whose opposition is all but assured will highlight the WashingtonÂ native's rulings and writings on controversial issues and seek assurances on how he would rule in future casesÂ â questions Kavanaugh will parry without makingÂ any promises. âThere will be sparks at this hearing. Sparks will fly,"" said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn. ""And there will be a lot of heat.â ThereÂ already has been a lot of money spent on both sides of the Kavanaugh nomination,Â nearly all of it in the few states from Maine to Alaska where senators' votes are in play. Conservative groups including the National Rifle Association have spent more than $4 million on television ads alone, outpacing liberal groups concerned about abortion rights, health care and the financing of election campaigns. Supreme Court confirmation battles are always controversial, but only in recent years have they become so partisan and the Senate votes razor-thin. The last two justices to leave the courtÂ â Antonin Scalia, who died in 2016, and Anthony Kennedy, whose retirement in July created the current vacancyÂ â were confirmed unanimously. The vote in 1991 on Clarence Thomas was 52-48, and the last four justices to be confirmed received 54 toÂ 68 votes. Justice Neil Gorsuch's nomination last year was controversial because Senate Republicans refused in 2016 to consider President Barack Obama's nominee, Merrick Garland. Gorsuch replaced Scalia, a like-minded conservative, 17 months ago. A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.  Not since Justice Samuel Alito replaced Justice Sandra Day O'Connor in 2006Â has the ideological balance of power on the court been threatened. Kennedy was the perennial swing vote on social issues ranging from abortion to same-sex marriage. Kavanaugh is likely to align more reliably with the other four conservative justices. To that initial hurdle, Trump's choice of Kavanaugh from a list of 25 potential nominees added several others. Kavanaugh's career choices have included a stint investigating President Bill Clinton, which led to his impeachment, and working for President George W. Bush as deputy White House counsel and staff secretary. The paper trail from those jobs proved to be too voluminous for the Senate to pile through before the high court's 2018 term opens in October, or even before the midterm elections in November. So Republicans have released only those documents they consider most relevantÂ â about 440,000 pages for senators to see, and fewer than 300,000 publicly. That's far more than for any previous Supreme Court nominee. But Democrats said millions ofÂ pages have been withheld. Friday, the Trump administration said it would withhold more than 100,000 pages on the basis of presidential privilege. âWe were not able to get a lot of documentsÂ we felt we were entitled to,"" said Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, the top Democrat on the committee. ""Weâre laboring under this disadvantage.â Abortion rights supporters and anti-abortion protesters demonstrate in front of the Supreme Court July 9 after President Donald Trump nominated federal appeals court Judge Brett Kavanaugh. (Photo: Getty Images) Trump made clear during the 2016 presidential campaign that he wanted to promote judges who were ""pro-life"" and who would defend  Americans' gun rights under the Second Amendment. He has sought to overturn Obama's signature legislative achievement, the Affordable Care Act, through the courts if necessary. On those issues and more,Â Kavanaugh passed the test. âItâs not often that a presidentÂ states full-out before the nomination is even made that heâs looking for someone who will overturn the ACA and Roe v Wade,"" which legalized abortion nationwide, said Nan Aron, president of the liberal Alliance for Justice. ""We have to take Donald Trump and the White House and (Senate Republican leader) Mitch McConnell atÂ their word.â â¢On abortion,Â Kavanaugh dissented from his court's ruling last year that allowed anÂ undocumented teenagerÂ in federal custody to get an abortion.Â He cited Supreme Court precedents under which he said ""the government has permissible interests in favoring fetal life, protecting the best interests of a minor, and refraining from facilitating abortion."" During his confirmation hearing for the circuit court in 2006, KavanaughÂ said he would ""follow Roe v. Wade faithfully and fully. ... It's been reaffirmed many times."" Two weeks ago, he told Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, an abortion rights supporter whose support is crucial, that he considered the 1973 decision ""settled law.""Â  But inÂ a speech last year, KavanaughÂ heaped praise on the late Chief Justice William Rehnquist, citing among other things Rehnquist's dissent in Roe. Rehnquist, he said, ""stated that under the courtâs precedents, any such unenumerated right had to be rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people."" â¢On gun control,Â Kavanaugh dissented in 2011 from an appeals court ruling that upheld a District of Columbia ban on semiautomatic rifles. Under the Supreme Court'sÂ precedent in District of Columbia v. Heller in 2008 âÂ with Kennedy in the majority â Kavanaugh said theÂ banÂ was unconstitutional. As someone who grew up in the District of Columbia when it was plagued by guns, drugs and gang violence, Kavanaugh indicated he was conflicted on a policy basis, but ""the law and the Constitution ... compel the result.â â¢On health care, Kavanaugh dissented in 2011 from an appeals court ruling upholding theÂ Affordable Care ActÂ but only on procedural grounds. He said the law's mandate that individuals purchase health insurance or pay a tax penalty to the Internal Revenue Service could not be challenged before any payment was made.Â  ""History and precedent counsel caution before reaching out to decide difficultÂ  constitutional questions too quickly, especially when the underlying issues are of lasting significance,"" he wrote. ""After all, what appears to be obviously correct now can look quite different just a few years down the road."" Though those issues may resonate most withÂ average Americans, Democrats are likely to delve even more deeply into Kavanaugh's views of presidential power. He has written that Congress should immunize presidents from criminal investigations and personal civil suits while in office. The question picked up steam last monthÂ whenÂ Michael Cohen, the president's personal lawyer and ""fixer,"" pleaded guilty to violations of campaign finance law and implicated the president in payoffs during the 2016 campaign to a former Playboy model and a porn star.

The moment Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley began his opening remarks, Sen. Kamala Harris, a California Democrat, interrupted to take issue with lawmakers' access to documents from Kavanaugh's tenure as a staffer in the George W. Bush White House.   When Grassley did not allow it, Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut called the hearing ""a charade and a mockery of our norms"" while motioning to adjourn the hearing as protesters opposing Kavanaugh erupted in applause and chants.   Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey then began asking for postponement while Grassley banged his chairman's gavel and called for regular order.   ""What is the rush? What are we trying to hide by not having the documents out front?"" Booker asked. ""What is with the rush? What are we not hiding by not letting those documents come out? Sir, this committee is a violation of the values that we as a committee have striven for.""   But Grassley would not have any of it, instead insisting the hearing would continue as planned.   ""Maybe it isn't going exactly the way the minority would like to have it go, but we have said for a long period of time that we were going to proceed on this very day,"" Grassley said. ""And I think we ought to give the American people the opportunity to hear whether Judge Kavanaugh should be on the Supreme Court or not.""   While Grassley was pleading for regular order, a protester began screaming loudly in the hearing room. Sen. Orrin Hatch, the most senior Republican senator, could be overheard on camera saying, ""Get her thrown out of here, my God.""   Eventually, the fight among senators calmed down and Grassley proceeded with his opening remarks.   ",0.049,0.883,0.067,0.8369,0.30099622599622594

Cory Booker releasing confidential documents to the public in a knowing violation of Senate rules. “I knowingly violated the rules that were put forth, and I’m told that the committee confidential rules have knowing consequences,” he said. “I am going to release the email about racial profiling, and I understand that the penalty comes with potential ousting from the Senate.” Booker said on Thursday morning that he felt compelled to publicly release the documents from Kavanaugh’s time in the George W. Bush Administration, because he felt the process has not been fair and that the public should know what is in them. The documents he released related to his line of questioning for Kavanaugh last night, about an e-mail discussing racial profiling. “I knowingly violated the rules that were put forth, and I’m told that the committee confidential rules have knowing consequences,” Booker said during the hearing. “I am going to release the email about racial profiling, and I understand that the penalty comes with potential ousting from the Senate.” “I openly invite and accept the consequences of my team releasing that document right now,” he added. After Cornyn read the Senate rules about the repercussions for disclosing confidential business of the Senate, which includes committees, which carries the punishment of expulsion from the chamber, Booker responded, “bring it.” Less than a half hour later, his office released the documents. Neither his office nor the Senate Judiciary Committee immediately responded to questions about the possible repercussions for the Senator. The e-mail, dated January 17, 2002, and titled “racial profiling,” Kavanaugh says he generally favors race neutral security measures, but needs to grapple with the question of what to do in the interim before a “truly effective and comprehensive race-neutral system is developed and implemented.” Booker’s fellow Democrats on the committee immediately jumped to his defense, as did Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. “All of these documents belong to the people of the United States,” said Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal, who is Booker’s committee colleague. “They will come out eventually.” Booker’s decision appears to be a culmination of Democrats’ anger over the way the documents from Kavanaugh’s time in the Bush White House has been handled. Kavanaugh served in the White House Counsel’s office during the Bush Administration and subsequently served as staff secretary. Democrats insisted they should have access to all of the documents from his time as staff secretary, but Republicans demurred. Senate Republicans requested documents from Kavanaugh’s time in the White House counsel, but Democrats weren’t satisfied. Their anger only grew after the National Archives said it could not complete the document review until October, leading Republicans to rely on the Bush Presidential library. The documents are now being reviewed — and designated for viewing — by attorney Bill Burck. Burck has represented several figures connected to Trump, including his former strategist and current White House Counsel Don McGahn (who is leaving this fall), causing to Democrats to claim the process is even more partisan. “No Senate rule accounts for Bill Burck’s review of the documents,” said Booker. “No Senate rule and no history of the Senate accounts for what is going on right now.” In a statement after the documents were released, Burck said Booker had requested publicizing them last night, and he had acquiesced. “We were surprised to learn about Senator Booker’s histrionics this morning because we had already told him he could use the documents publicly,” Burck wrote in an e-mail to TIME. “In fact, we have said yes to every request made by the Senate Democrats to make documents public.” Republicans immediately dismissed Booker’s mechanisms as grandstanding and an open audition for a 2020 presidential campaign. “Running for President,” said Texas Senator John Cornyn, “is no excuse for violating Senate rules.”  ",0.049,0.903,0.047,-0.5075,0.34564935064935065

Here's your briefing on some of the most important and interesting stories happening in the week ahead. What's happening? On Tuesday, confirmation hearings will begin into President Donald Trump's nominee for the US Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh. Why is this important? If he gets confirmed by the Senate, Mr Kavanaugh will help turn the Supreme Court in a more conservative direction for a generation. As a result, the fate of divisive issues such as abortion and immigration could come into focus.  Mr Kavanaugh is likely to be confirmed, but he could face some awkward questions during the hearings. Chief among them is likely to be: would you excuse yourself from ruling on a case involving the president who nominated you to the top court in the land? What's happening? The economy in Venezuela, a country of about 30m people, is in freefall - experts warn inflation this year could hit 1,000,000%. So on Saturday, a new minimum wage, 34 times its previous level, came into force to try to help workers.  Why is this important? It's far from the first time the government has raised the minimum wage - but it's never done so to this extent. This presents businesses, particularly small ones, with a problem: if they stay open and pay their employees the increased wage, they may be forced out of business. But because of price controls on many items, it will be hard for them to balance out the increased costs (a step that could repel customers anyway). From early this week, we may get a sense of how businesses are coping and whether this move actually ends up making things worse. More than two million Venezuelans have fled the country since 2014, with hundreds of thousands leaving for neighbouring countries in the past year. What's happening? On Sunday, 9 September, the Arirang Mass Games begin in North Korea. Prepare for enormous co-ordinated displays unlike anything else seen anywhere in the world. Why is this important? They're the first Games in five years, and are reportedly being held to give the people of North Korea a morale boost and to help the economy. Tickets to each event reportedly cost up to â¬800 ($933; Â£717) - meaning the country could rake in good money at a time it is still under sanctions from many Western nations. The colourful displays may well be striking, and will no doubt make headlines, but it's important to remember that the UN says that children are forced to take part, or to help in the build-up. How big will these Games be? If the sneaky satellite images taken in the past two weeks are any indication, they're going to be very big indeed. What's happening? The last big battle in the seven-year Syrian war looks like it could be about to begin. Why is this important? There are about three million people living in north-western Idlib province, the last major area held by the opposition. The province is dominated by jihadists and rebel fighters, though most of the people there are civilians. Many fighters and their families have been evacuated there from other rebel-held areas under truce deals with the government. A major build-up of the military outside Idlib has already started and Russia, the Syrian government's ally, has been stepping up its presence nearby in the Mediterranean Sea. Meanwhile, Russia and Syria have accused rebel fighters of preparing to use chemical attacks in Idlib to blame pro-government forces. UN investigators say government forces have used chemical weapons several times during the conflict, despite Syria's denial. What's happening? Executives from Facebook, Twitter and Google will give evidence on Wednesday about what they are doing to stop foreign powers from using their online platforms to influence US politics. Why is this important? We're two months away from the US mid-term elections, that will help shape the country's politics for the next two years and beyond. After Russian attempts to influence voters in the 2016 presidential election via social networks, there's a lot of attention on who might be trying to do the same this time around. So are tech companies doing enough in 2018? What evidence have they seen that foreign powers are trying to meddle?

Dozens of protesters were removed from Judge Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation hearing for a second day on Wednesday as the Supreme Court nominee answered questions on a wide variety of legal issues for the first time.
 
The questioning ended more than 12 hours later Wednesday night and Kavanaugh faced a second round Thursday.
 
In the first round, Senate Judiciary Committee members had 30 minutes each to question Kavanaugh on his record, including his time on the federal bench. Senators' questions Wednesday ranged from Kavanaugh's philosophy on the role of a judge, his opinion of Roe v. Wade, and his role in programs implemented after 9/11 at the Bush White House.
 
Here are five of the key questions asked:
 
How does he view the role of a judge and judicial independence?
 
What does he mean by referring to Roe v. Wade as ""settled law?""
 
Can a president be forced to respond to a subpoena?
 
Can a president pardon himself?
 
 Involvement in Bush-era detainee interrogation programs?
 
Kavanaugh's responses are below:
 
How does he view the role of a judge and judicial independence?
 
Chairman Charles Grassley started off the questioning by asking Kavanaugh to describe his idea of a good judge. As protesters interrupted repeatedly, Kavanaugh said that a good judge is independent, citing cases such as Brown v. Board of Education and United States v. Nixon, in which courts issued unpopular rulings despite political or public pressure.
 
""I'm a pro-law judge and I've ruled for parties based on whether they have the law on their side. That's part of being an independent judge -- is ruling for the party no matter who they are so long as the party is right. If you walk into my courtroom and you have the better legal arguments, you will win,"" he said.
 
 
 
 
 
Democrats questioned Kavanaugh on his views on previous Supreme Court decisions, including Roe v. Wade, but he said ""nominee precedent"" weighs heavily on him as he answers questions. He cited previous Supreme Court nominees as insisting in their confirmation hearings that judges can offer no forecasts or hints on how they might rule on a case.
 
""If I say something and the case comes before me five years from now I'll feel morally bound by what I said here. If I've crossed the line of what I should say, then I'm not going to have an open mind in that case. That's a violation of judicial independence,"" he said.
 
Kavanaugh also said that when he makes decisions he considers the language Congress intended and possible compromises that were negotiated in a law before it was passed. He said that judges interpret the law but it isn't their role to change it from what Congress intended.
 
""I try to point out when we're having oral argument in a case or deciding cases if we deviate from what Congress wrote we're potentially upsetting careful compromise even if we think we would have struck the compromise in a different place as judges, that is not really our role,"" he said.
 
Tuesday's hearing was interrupted and delayed by protesters and protests from Democrats who say the hearing should be delayed until they receive more documents from Kavanaugh's time working for President George W. Bush.
 
 
 
Republicans accused the minority of playing politics with a nomination they've already promised to oppose, but that won't stop them from asking charged questions about a number of high-profile issues as they press Kavanaugh to discuss his views on abortion, gun rights, the powers of the presidency and whether President Donald Trump could be subpoenaed in the special counsel's investigation.
 
There were some lighthearted moments in Wednesday's hearing. When Sen. Lindsey Graham asked Kavanaugh how he would like to be remembered the nominee said as a good father and a good judge, but ranking member Dianne Feinstein interjected that the nominee should add ""a good husband"" to the list.
 
 A light-hearted moment at the Kavanaugh hearing:
 
""How would you like to be remembered?"" Sen. Lindsey Graham asks.
 
""A good dad, a good judge,"" Kavanaugh says.
 
""A good husband,"" Sen. Dianne Feinstein chimes in, prompting laughter https://t.co/Xt5uE6CyvV pic.twitter.com/cbw8BlOkwu 
 
More than once during the hearing Kavanaugh held up or referred to a pocket Constitution that appeared to be well-worn. Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, asked Kavanaugh if he will owe loyalty to the President if he is confirmed.
 
 
 
""If confirmed to the Supreme Court and as a sitting judge, I owe my loyalty to the Constitution. That is what I owe loyalty to. And the Constitution establishes me as an independent judge bound to follow the law as written, the precedents of the Supreme Court as articulated subject to the rules of stare decisis,"" Kavanaugh said, referring to the Latin term for legal precedent.
 
What does he mean by referring to Roe v. Wade as ""settled law?""
 
The ranking Democrat on the committee, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, was the first to ask Kavanaugh about abortion. She asked him to explain what he means when he says the Roe v. Wade decision is ""settled law.""
 
Kavanaugh called Roe v. Wade ""important precedent of the Supreme Court"" that has been reaffirmed many times over the years, most importantly in the Planned Parenthood v. Casey decision in 1992. In that case, he said the Supreme Court evaluated all the points of Roe using the legal process for evaluating previous cases and reaffirmed the decision, which makes Casey ""precedent upon precedent"" for the Roe decision, which established the legal right to an abortion in the United States.
 
 Sen. Dianne Feinstein asks Brett Kavanaugh if his views on Roe v. Wade have changed: ""Do you believe it is correct law?""
 
Kavanaugh: ""I said that it's settled as a precedent of the Supreme Court entitled to respect ... it has been reaffirmed many times"" https://t.co/WQ5biYuAIX pic.twitter.com/Cq697yPb4k 
 
He said he understands Feinstein's point of view that women should have a right to legal abortion, though he did not say he agreed with that view.
 
""I understand how passionate and how deeply people feel about this issue. I understand the importance of the issue. I understand the importance that people attach to the Roe versus Wade decision, to the Planned Parenthood versus Casey decision. I don't live in a bubble. I understand, I live in the real world. I understand the importance of the issue,"" he said.
 
Planned Parenthood v. Casey did support the Roe decision that women have a right to abortion but also said states can impose restrictions as long as they aren't an ""undue burden,"" or exist solely to make it more difficult for a woman to get an abortion before the fetus is viable.
 
 
 
Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., asked Kavanaugh to explain his use of the phrase ""abortion on demand"" in his dissent in the case regarding an undocumented minor. He said the phrase is a signal to conservatives and anti-abortion groups that Kavanaugh would be open to overturning Roe v. Wade if on the court.
 
Kavanaugh emphasized that the young women in the case was a minor and that his dissent focused on parental consent laws and that his dissent did not deny she had a right to an abortion, just that the procedure could be delayed until she was out of the government detention facility.
 
""I'm not familiar with the code word. What I am familiar with is Chief Justice Burger in his concurrence in Roe v. Wade itself. So he joined the majority in Roe v. Wade, and he wrote a concurrence that specifically said that the court today does not uphold abortion on demand. That's his phrase, and he joined the majority in Roe v. Wade. And what that meant in practice over the years, over the last 45 years, is that reasonable regulations are permissible so long as they don't constitute an undue burden,"" Kavanaugh said.
 
Some Democrats and abortion rights groups have said that merely saying Roe v. Wade is precedent is not enough for them to support Kavanaugh because the Supreme Court can change precedent.
 
Earlier in the hearing, Kavanaugh said that leading up to his nomination, he was not asked his opinion on Roe or how he would rule in specific cases.
 
Can a president be forced to respond to a subpoena?
 
Kavanaugh said the United States v. Nixon decision that forced President Richard Nixon to turn over tapes to the special prosecutor was ""one of the greatest moments in Supreme Court history"" because the justices stood up for judicial independence in a moment of national crisis.
 
But he declined to answer Feinstein's question about whether a sitting president can be required to respond to a subpoena, saying any answer would violate the principle that nominees shouldn't give views on hypothetical cases.
 
""I can't give you an answer on that hypothetical question,"" he said.
 
 Sen. Dianne Feinstein: ""Can a sitting president be required to respond to a subpoena?""
 
Brett Kavanaugh: ""... I can't give you an answer on that hypothetical question"" https://t.co/WQ5biYuAIX pic.twitter.com/dHl7IqmvBI 
 
Kavanaugh also declined to say that he would recuse himself from any criminal or civil case related to President Trump, who nominated him.
 
""I think to be consistent with the principle of the independence of the judiciary I should not and may not make a commitment about how I would handle a particular case and the decision to participate in a case is itself a decision in a particular case,"" he said.
 
 
 
Feinstein also asked Kavanaugh about his frequently cited comments that a president should not face criminal investigation while in office.
 
Kavanaugh said he proposed ideas for Congress to consider in a 2009 law review article but ""they were not my constitutional views"" and that he has never taken a position on what the Constitution says about investigating a sitting president or whether a sitting president can be indicted.
 
Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., pushed Kavanaugh on comments he made during the Ken Starr investigation in 1998. Coons quoted comments Kavanaugh made on a panel where he reportedly said no one should investigate possible criminal conduct by a sitting president and wrote that a congressional inquiry should take precedence over a criminal investigation.
 
But Kavanaugh said his comments were misconstrued, and that he actually argued in favor of independent counsels in a law review article the same year. He also said that he's never taken a position on whether a sitting president can be investigated or indicted and that it's actually the Justice Department position that a president can't be indicted while in office.
 
""I have never taken a position on indicting or investigating a sitting president,"" he said.
 
But Coons said he wanted to discuss the issue further.
 
""Frankly, judge, your views about executive power that you have detailed, what you like to overturn and what limits you think there should be, really leaves me concerned. It's because of our current context, because of the environment that we're operating in,"" Coons said.
 
Republican Jeff Flake asked Kavanaugh to comment on one of President Trump's recent tweets complaining to Attorney General Jeff Sessions about Justice Department indictments of two GOP congressmen, both early Trump supporters, close to the midterm elections.
 
""Should a president be able to use his authority to pressure executive or independent agencies to carry out directives for purely political purposes?"" Flake asked.
 
""I don't think we want judges commenting on the latest political controversies because that would ultimately lead people to doubt if we're independent or politicians in robes,"" Kavanaugh answered.
 
There were some tense moments late Wednesday night when Democrat Kamala Harris asked Kavanaugh whether he had discussed the Mueller investigation with anyone at Kasowitz Benson Torres - the law firm of President Trump's personal lawyer, Marc Kasowitz.
 
When Kavanaugh asked for a name, she declined to say but seemed to suggest she had more information.
 
""I want to be careful,"" Kavanaugh said.
 
""It's a very direct question,"" Harris replied, finally saying, ""I'll move on. Clearly, you're not going to answer the question.""
 
Can a president pardon himself?
 
Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, asked Kavanaugh if a president could pardon himself, as President Trump has said he could do, or could pardon someone in exchange for a bribe for a promise not to testify against him.
 
Kavanaugh declined to answer, saying it was a hypothetical question that he couldn't comment on as a judge.
 
 
 
 Involvement in Bush-era detainee interrogation programs?
 
Republican Orrin Hatch asked Kavanaugh whether he misled the committee in his 2006 confirmation hearings for the federal bench. At the time, Kavanaugh was questioned about his knowledge of the crafting of detainee interrogation programs while working in the Bush White House Counsel's office.
 
""I told the truth and the whole truth in my prior testimony. I was not read into that program,"" Kavanaugh said.
 
Leahy pressed Kavanaugh on whether he was involved in interrogation programs or programs allowing warrantless surveillance of U.S. citizens put in place after September 11.
 
Kavanaugh said he can't rule out that he offered a legal opinion in those discussions because it was ""all hands on deck"" after the attacks, but denied that he was ever read in or explicitly involved in creating those programs.
 
During his questions Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., lamented the drama from Democrats and interruptions from protesters at Tuesday's hearing, saying, ""I just wish if we could have a hearing where the nominee's kids could show up."" Kavanaugh's two daughters were at Tuesday's hearing but were escorted out during the protests.
 
""I want your daughters to know that what happened yesterday is unique to the times that we live in. And I want to give you a chance to say some things to the people that have attended this hearing. I think there is a father of a Parkland student who was killed. I think there is a mother of a child who has got terrible health care problems. And there are many other people here with personal situations. What would you like to say to them, if anything, about your job as a Supreme Court justice?"" Graham asked.
 
Fred Guttenberg, whose daughter was killed in the school shooting in Parkland, Florida, attended the hearing Tuesday and accused Kavanaugh of refusing to shake his hand when he approached the nominee during a break.
 
Kavanaugh, noting he volunteers at a Catholic charity, said he is sensitive to the impact of his legal decisions on the parties involved.
 
""I want to reassure everyone that I base my decisions on the law, but I do so with an awareness of the facts and an awareness of the real world consequences. And I've not lived in a bubble. And I understand how passionately people feel about particular issues. And I understand how personally people are affected by issues. And I understand the difficulties that people have in America,"" he said.

Democrats tried valiantly to draw the federal appeals court judge out on a number of controversial issues but were unable to pull him off his talking points on presidential power or a host of social issues, from abortion to workers' rights.Â  The potential that Kavanaugh, 53, will play a key role in a future high court case involving President Donald Trump cast a cloud over the process. Several Democrats even questioned whether the judge was chosen to protect Trump, because he has written that presidents should be immune from criminal investigation and civil lawsuits while in office. Friday's final day featuresÂ emotional testimony, including from a student who survived February'sÂ shooting atÂ Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida; the attorney who represented an undocumented teenager whose request for an abortion Kavanaugh sought temporarily to block; and former White House counsel John Dean, whose testimony during the Watergate scandal in 1974 helped lead to President Richard Nixon's resignation. Aalayah Eastmond, the 16-year-old Parkland student, recounted lying beneath the body of a dead classmate and being sure she was going to die. Her testimony was in response to Kavanaugh's dissent in a District of Columbia case, inÂ which he would have struck down the district's ban on semi-automatic weapons. ""I told God that I knew I was going to die. I asked Him: please make it fast. I didn't want to feel anything,"" she said. As some senators cried, she asked them to ""remember my story, remember my classmates who died, remember the victimsÂ of color that face mass shootings every day, remember all victims of gun violence."" On Kavanaugh's side were former law clerks, students,Â friends and even Boston Marathon running mates, along with two prominent former U.S. solicitors generalÂ during George W. Bush's administration, when he worked in the White House. Two representatives of the American Bar Association testified that Kavanaugh received the group's unanimous highest rating after a rigorous review involving about 120 interviews. âWhat we saw was an allegiance to the law,"" said John Tarpley, who headed the review panel. ""I did not see a pattern to his decisions.â Opponents invited by Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee criticized Kavanaugh's rulings and writings on abortion, contraception, disability and racial justice.Â  Rochelle Garza, an attorney who represented a 17-year-old undocumented immigrant whose request for an abortion was blocked by the Trump administration, said Kavanaugh's opinion would have required her to wait longerÂ â potentially beyond the 20-week limit under Texas law. His appeals court ultimately allowed the abortion. âNo one should be shamed for making the right decisionÂ for themselves,â Garza said. Kavanaugh's law clerks, students, friends and fellow attorneys chosen by Republicans to represent him on the hearing's last day uniformly called him even-tempered and open-minded. Akhil Reed Amar, a liberal law professor at Yale University and a renowned constitutional scholar, warned Democrats against rejecting Kavanaugh, whom he described as the best potential nominee of a Republican president. âIf not Brett, who?â Amar said.Â âDonât be mad, be smart. Be careful what you wish for.â Kavanaugh, who serves on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, was nominated two months ago from a list of 25 potential nominees. Since then, he has been endorsed by nearly all the Senate's Republicans but not a single Democrat.Â  The committee is expected to vote on Kavanaugh's nomination in two weeks, leaving time for a full Senate vote before the high court's 2018 term starts Oct. 1.

Kavanaugh currently faces allegations of sexually assaulting a woman when they were both teenagers with the help of one of his friends from school.   The woman, Christine Blasey Ford, alleges Kavanaugh attempted to force himself onto her at a party in the early 1980s. Kavanaugh's friend,  Mark Judge, is accused of being his accomplice in the alleged act.   Kavanaugh and Judge both attended Georgetown Prep, one of the top high schools for boys in the DC area, and graduated in 1983.   While delivering remarks at the Columbus School of Law in March 2015, Kavanaugh made a jocular reference to his alma mater: ""We had a good saying that we've held firm to to this day as the dean was reminding me before the talk, which is what happens at Georgetown Prep stays at Georgetown Prep. That's been a good thing for all of us.""    Both Kavanaugh and Judge have both vehemently denied Ford's allegations, which could derail Kavanaugh's Supreme Court nomination.   Kavanaugh and Ford have been invited to testify on the alleged incident before the Senate Judiciary Committee next Monday. Kavanaugh has accepted the invitation but Republicans on Tuesday said Ford had yet to respond.   Judge on Tuesday issued a statement claiming he had no memory of the alleged assault and  said he did not wish to testify, rejecting calls from Senate Democrats for him to do so.                                                                                               Judge is the author of two memoirs, ""Wasted"" and ""God and Man at Georgetown Prep."" In both,  he details the drinking and debauchery he took part in while at Prep.

    US Senator Kamala Harris on Wednesday questioned Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh about whether he had spoken with a particular law firm about special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation. (Sept. 6)
    AP Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh at his Senate Judiciary Committee confirmation hearing, Sept. 6, 2018, Washington, DC.(Photo: Jacquelyn Martin, AP) The nomination and confirmation of a Supreme Court justice is supposed to be a grave and solemn exercise of carefully apportioned constitutional powers. These Justices, granted lifetime terms in order to insulate them from political considerations, must be exemplars of sound judgment, even temperamentÂ and, above all else, impartiality. I know this because I keep hearing Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee say this stuff. But having served alongside them for three Supreme Court confirmations âÂ and now watching Brett Kavanaughâs confirmation process unfold âÂ I have to say, I donât think they really mean it. Recall that, in his opening remarks at the White House ceremony announcing his nomination, Judge Kavanaugh praised President Donald Trumpâs diligence, declaring that âno president has ever consulted more widely, or talked with more people from more backgrounds, to seek input about a Supreme Court nomination.â This was extremely untrue. President Barack Obama, for example, had taken a month or close to it to pick bothÂ Sonia SotomayorÂ and Elena Kagan. Trump had taken just 12 days to make his pick. And, of course, he made that pick from a list of 25 names presented to him by the right-wing Federalist Society. If judgment matters, and if we want judges who make their judgments based on a full and fair understanding of the facts, a big, fat, easily debunked lie like Kavanaughâs should have been instantly disqualifying. Instead, it became just the first example of how Kavanaughâs selection to the Supreme Court represents a perfect illustration of what the conservative movement has been doing to the judicial system for decades. Kavanaugh is the very model of a young, archconservative judge who has been groomed for moments like this one precisely because conservative activists know that he will issue expansive, activist rulings to further their agenda. Advancing the goals of the Republican Party and the conservative movement âÂ starting by lavishing obviously nonsensical praise on a president whose own staff, per this weekâs anonymous New York Times op-ed, considers him to be an unstable idiot who operates out of whim âÂ thatâs what Kavanaugh is there to do. And no matter how much civics-class pabulum we get from Republicans on the Judiciary Committee this week, make no mistake: Theyâre in on it. More: Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court hearing protests are as American as apple pie Don't consider Brett Kavanaugh for Supreme Court until Mueller investigation is over Facts, nuance should matter more in Al Franken rush to judgment Just look at the way Chairman Chuck Grassley has treated documents related to Kavanaughâs time as a senior official in the George W. Bush administration. He allowed Bill Burck â a former assistant and close friend of Kavanaughâs and also the attorney for several prominent Trump administration figures âÂ to sort through Kavanaughâs papers in order to decide which should be released publicly. I can only imagine what that was like: âNothing, nothing, nothing, smoking gun. Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, smoking gun, nothing ...â In the end, thousands of documents were declared âconfidentialâ and withheld, although they were likely on extremely relevant topics such as torture during the war on terror. And in the middle of the night before the first day of hearings, the committee received a dump ofÂ 42,000 pagesÂ (which,Â GrassleyÂ insisted roughly 42,000 times, his staff had somehow been able to review over the course of a few hours). Why the secrecy? Why the rush? Because Republicans are intent on getting a fifth vote on the bench to protect Trump from special counsel Robert Mueller'sÂ investigation in time for the Supreme Courtâs fall term. I had to laugh when, during the hearings, Kavanaugh called the question of whether a president can be subpoenaed a âhypothetical.â Really? Kavanaugh wasÂ part of independent counselÂ KenÂ Starr's investigationÂ of President Bill Clinton in the 1990s âÂ and, therefore, he is one of the few people on this earth who has actually participated in subpoenaing a president. Brett Kavanaugh is a partisan who was nominated, and will likely be confirmed, in order to help achieve the Republican Partyâs goals: destroying protections for people with pre-existing health conditions, eradicating whatâs left of workersâ rightsÂ and, yes, overturning Roe v. Wade. Everyone knows it âÂ including Sen. Susan Collins. When she emerged from her meeting with Kavanaugh, she said he told her he considers Roe v. Wade ""settled law.âÂ If she somehow believed it then âÂ even after Trump had promised to make overturning Roe a litmus test for his nominees âÂ she canât possibly believe it now, given new emails showing that Kavanaugh himself has questioned whether Roe is indeed settled. Itâs maddening to watch her and the rest of the Republicans continue to pretend that they still have any respect for the high-minded ideals that are supposed to preserve the impartiality and independence of the Supreme Court. Kavanaugh is proof that there is no precedent they wonât trample, no revelation they wonât shrug off, no principle they wonât contradict, if it means getting the outcomes they want. Democrats should stop letting them get away with it. The decision by Judiciary Committee Democrats to ignore Grassleyâs hiding of documents and release them directly was a good start. But itâs time for all of us on the left to recognize that Republicans have already destroyed the independence of our judicial system and turned it into yet another partisan battlefield âÂ and then figure out how weâre going to start fighting back.

Born into a well-off family in Montgomery County, Maryland, Ford has said she spent years working to recover from an assault as a young girl in that world of prep school parties — by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, she would disclose years later. Long before she decided to come forward, Ford, now 51, had built a new life for herself in Malibu, Honolulu and the San Francisco Bay area, embracing academia, surfing, cheering on the Stanford football team and taking in outdoor rock concerts. Ford settled in the Silicon Valley in the 1990s, when the first wave of the tech boom was transforming lives around her and startups were replacing peach orchards. She began working as a research psychologist and biostatistician at Stanford University, one of the most elite universities in the country. She later was hired as a professor in a consortium between Stanford and Palo Alto University. Soon, she married her husband in a nearby coastal town, and they bought a classic Eichler home in Palo Alto and had two sons. “She is very friendly, outgoing and brilliant, and she is a great mother,” said clinical psychologist Erin Heinemeyer, a mentee of Ford’s who is also a friend. “I know in general she supports women’s rights, and she often stands up for students, and she had expressed concerns to me about other students who might be struggling.” Months after anonymously contacting her elected officials, Ford went public on Sunday telling The Washington Post that Kavanaugh pinned her to a bed at a Maryland house party in the early 1980s and tried to take her clothes off. He put his hand over her mouth when she tried to scream, she said, and she feared he might inadvertently kill her. She said she was around 15 at the time and he would have been about 17. Through the White House, Kavanaugh issued a statement saying he “categorically and unequivocally” denied the allegation. “He is an incredible man. He’s an incredible intellect. He will make an incredible Supreme Court justice,” said President Donald Trump on Tuesday. The allegation has shaken up the battle over Kavanaugh’s confirmation, and Republicans are calling for a public hearing with both accuser and accused testifying. But lawyers for Ford say that she wants an FBI investigation of her allegation in advance of a Judiciary Committee hearing set for Monday. The lawyers said in a letter that Ford wants to cooperate with the panel. But they say that in the days since she gone public with her allegation, she has been the target of “vicious harassment and even death threats.” Her family has relocated, they said. An FBI investigation “should be the first step in addressing the allegations,” the lawyers wrote Tuesday in a letter obtained by The Associated Press. Kavanaugh supporters have called Ford’s credibility and motivations into question. Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, told NBC News that Ford is “mixed up,” and called Kavanaugh “honest” and “straightforward.” Several former colleagues said that, as a biostatistician and psychologist, Ford was known for her scrupulous and meticulous professional conduct. She has published several books and more than 65 peer-reviewed journal articles. Her work often involves analyzing data gathered in medical studies ranging from investigations of new depression treatments to opioid addiction interventions and traumatic brain injury research. Sarah Adler, a former student of Ford’s who is now a clinical psychologist at Stanford, co-organized a letter in support of her former professor that had been signed by more than 300 colleagues and former students by Tuesday afternoon. Another letter of support has been signed by more than 700 graduates of her private prep school, Holton-Arms. “I think she felt morally compelled to come forward, which is very much in line with what I know of her,” said Adler. “She analyzes the data and lets the data tell the story.” Ford values clear professional boundaries and isn’t one to share personal struggles with coworkers, the former colleagues said. “She never said a word about this,” said Allan Reiss, a Stanford professor of psychiatry with whom she has written numerous scholarly publications. “But the fact that I know her as a person of integrity and honesty, it doesn’t surprise me that she came forward and that she has a personal sense of the importance of what she has to say.” It was in couple’s counseling with her husband in 2012 that she first described an encounter with Kavanaugh in her freshman year of high school, she would later disclose. Friends who knew her from the beach and children’s sports circles said she struggled with the decision to come forward. “She’s been trying to forget about this all of her life, basically,” Jim Gensheimer, a friend of Ford’s told The San Jose Mercury News. “But she felt like somebody should know what this person was like and what he’s done before.” Timothy Avery, a former student who is now a postdoctoral research fellow, said he and many others admire her intellect and her kindness on the job. “She has reviewed statistics for trials and research being presented to the federal government,” Avery said. “This all requires a great deal of integrity. Other statisticians review her work, and she reviews theirs.” Colleagues and former students described her as competent and laid back, someone who is sure of her own footing and who balances work and family. Even as her appearance before the Senate Judiciary Committee remains up in the air, Avery said he thinks Ford can handle the blazing national spotlight. “It’s obviously terrible to have to deal with but because her dedication to truth is more important than her personal difficulties, I think she can handle it,” he said.",0.068,0.806,0.125,0.9965,0.3756663860830528

    USA TODAY A hurricane watch has been posted for coastal areas of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida, Â as  dangerousÂ Tropical Storm Gordon is expected to strengthen into a hurricane late Tuesday when it hits the Gulf Coast with winds of 74 mph and over.Â Strong wind gusts, battering waves, above-normal tides, minor coastal flooding, flash flooding and a couple of isolated tornadoes and waterspouts will be the main threats from the storm, AccuWeather said. The National Hurricane Center also issued a storm surge warning,Â meaning possible ""danger of life-threatening inundation,''Â for the area stretching from Shell Beach, Louisiana, to Dauphin Island, Alabama.Â   
    In the middle of Hurricane Season, Florida is getting hit with more extreme weather. The National Hurricane Center says Tropical Storm Gordon is bringing 45-mile-an hour winds to parts of South Florida including the keys.
    Time Kerry Perry, whose nine-month tenure as USA Gymnastics CEO was marked by heavy criticism and little tangible action in helping the organization recover from the Larry Nassar sexual abuse scandal, is expected to resign Tuesday.Â Though she preached transparency when she began the job, Perry's resignation, confirmed to USA TODAY Sports by two people with knowledge of the decision,Â was seen as inevitable â she madeÂ very few public statements and had no experience in gymnastics or the Olympic movement when she took over Dec. 1.Â Her expected departure will be the latest in USA Gymnastics afterÂ former CEO Steve Penny was forced to resign under pressure from the USOC in March 2017 for the way the organization handled sexual abuse complaints.Â  Students at Detroitâs city schools are starting the school year Tuesday with concerns about the safety of the cityâs water. The school district shut off drinking water to all of its schools after test results found elevated levels of lead or copper in 16 of 24 schools recently tested.Â Detroit's water department and the regional water and sewer agency for southeast Michigan issued a statement to assure residents that the lead and copper contamination with water in the school buildings do not extend to the pipes that deliver water to customers' homes.Â The district will be providing bottled water and using portable water coolers at schools when classes start.

From left to right: Neil Gorsuch, Nathan Forrester, Justice Kennedy, Brett Kavanaugh, Miles Ehrlich and Gary Feinerman.(Photo: Provided) WASHINGTONÂ â The 38 law clerks who began work at the Supreme Court in the summer of 1993 were a typically talented bunch. Three-quarters of them boasted degrees from Yale, Harvard, Stanford or the University of Chicago, the nation's four topÂ law schools.Â  They were an ambitious bunch as well. Among them were a future university president, U.S. solicitor general, Federal Communications Commission chairman, Pulitzer Prize winnerÂ and, predictably, several federal judges.Â  Amid that heady crowd, Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy's five clerks didn't stand out. Most of them played inÂ weekly pickupÂ basketball games on the building's fifth floor â the ""highest court in the land."" When it was their turn to host the clerks' weekly happy hour, they opted for PopeyesÂ chicken and beer. No one could have known that Kennedy's chambersÂ included not just one, but possibly two future Supreme Court justicesÂ âÂ Neil Gorsuch, confirmed to the high court last year, and Brett Kavanaugh, whose nomination is pending in the Senate.Â  âHad I known that I was walking among giants and breathing this rarefied air, I would have at least posed for more pictures with them,â Miles Ehrlich, a fellow Kennedy clerk andÂ now aÂ white-collar defense attorney in California, quipped. Only seven Supreme Court law clerks have ascended to the bench themselves, including four current justices. In addition to Gorsuch, Chief Justice John Roberts and Associate Justices Stephen Breyer and Elena Kagan were clerks.Â  But if Kavanaugh is confirmed, it would make Kennedy the first justice to watch two former clerks reach the benchÂ âÂ much less two from the same term. Gorsuch, polished and erudite byÂ age 26,Â was known as a no-nonsense clerk who split his time between Kennedy and retired Justice Byron White from his home state of Colorado. His duties for White at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit kept him away from Washington for much of the time. Kavanaugh, genial and down-to-earth at 28,Â had a reputation for burning the midnight oil, as well as shooting jump shots and organizing social events. When his name was added to President Donald Trump's list of potential nominees last fall, he instantly became the front-runner for the next opening âÂ an opening that Kennedy created with his retirement last month.Â  His fellow clerks apparently saw it coming long ago.Â  ""I thinkÂ people had a sense that he was somebody who was on an upward trajectory,â fellow Kennedy clerk NateÂ Forrester, now an attorney-adviser with the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel, said. ""He worked prodigiously long hours.â âAll of us would stay pretty late, but Brett might stay exceptionally late,"" federal District Court Judge Gary Feinerman, another of the Kennedy clerks that term, recalled. ""Justice Kennedy would often encourage Brett to take his foot off the gas just a bit.â Feinerman âÂ who in 2010 becameÂ Barack Obama's choice for a judgeship in the president's home state of Illinois âÂ saidÂ Kennedy's clerks were no smarter or more capable than their peers, whether they worked for the senior justice,Â Harry Blackmun, or the rookie, Ruth Bader Ginsburg. ""At the time, we were just a typical group of clerks,"" he said. The 1993 term coincided with the start of Bill Clinton's presidency and ended just months before the ""Republican revolution"" in Congress.Â But for Kennedy, Gorsuch and Kavanaugh, the caseload was ratherÂ ordinary,Â ranging from jury rulesÂ to waste disposal. A copyright case that stood out involved the hip-hop group 2 Live Crew's parody of Roy Orbison's hit song, ""Oh, Pretty Woman."" Ehrlich recalledÂ reading aloud lyrics, such as ""Bald-headed woman, girl your hair won't grow,""Â for Kennedy to compare to the version he knew. ""Iâm not sure any of us were particularly competent to be pop music critics, but it was a rather memorable moment,â Ehrlich said. The clerks split up the workloadÂ â preparing memos for all the justices on thousands of cases that would not be heard, asÂ well as digging into more than 90 casesÂ granted for oral argument. Each month, they divided up those cases, with Gorsuch joining inÂ group discussions held in Kennedy's office. By allÂ accounts, Kavanaugh put in the longest hours.Â âHe seemed to have sort of an extra gear that he could kick into when the rest of us were just absolutely exhausted,â Ehrlich said. The clerks were divided ideologically â Gorsuch, Kavanaugh and Forrester on the right, Ehrlich and Feinerman on the left. That led to heated discussions that Kennedy encouraged. âHe valued that, because he would like to hear different perspectives on cases when we were discussing them,â Feinerman recalled.Â âIt was all very friendly and professional."" In most of those discussions,Â âI donât think itâs any surprise that Brett and NeilÂ were on the right side of the 50-yard line,â he said. Ehrlich shared office space with Kavanaugh throughout the term. ""There were times on some cases when Brett and IÂ would really go at it,â he said.Â âBut over time, there were also plenty of cases where we agreed.â A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.  Â  Kavanaugh himself often has recalled organizing a clerks' trip to a Baltimore Orioles baseball game,Â with not just Kennedy but former Chief Justice William Rehnquist in tow. The chief went virtually unrecognized riding the rails and walking the streets. For security, the group had a single U.S. marshal. ""The whole day went off without a hitch, although I can't say I enjoyed any of it until we were all safely back in D.C. and went our own ways,"" Kavanaugh said last year in a speech honoring Rehnquist.Â  ""But I do remember when the chief said to me as we left Union Station at the end of the day that the trip had been enjoyable and very well-organized. â¦ From the chief, that was the highest praise."" When they weren't working, Kavanaugh would join Feinerman, Erhlich, ForresterÂ and clerks from other justices' chambers to play hoops. The 4-on-4 games were organized by Julius Genachowski, who clerked for Associate Justice David Souter and would become Federal Communications Commission chairman under Obama.Â  It was a way to blow off steam in the late afternoon, but it didn't signify the end of the work day. After the games, they would shower, grab dinner and return to their desks. Kavanaugh was known for his ball-handling skills and ""a running, one-handÂ floater"" of the type later made famous by Tony Parker, Forrester said. ""He had a decent jump shot, a proficient jump shot, better than most,"" Feinerman judges. ""And he was pretty quick.â But Ehrlich, the most liberal of the Kennedy clerks, noticed one proclivity. âBrett was a pretty skilled ball-handler and very good at driving to the right,"" Ehrlich said. ""But come to think about it â I donât think I ever saw him drive left.â More: Brett Kavanaugh is President Trump's nominee for the Supreme Court More: Will Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh deliver the change conservatives crave?

    USA TODAY Judge Brett Kavanaugh and President Donald Trump on July 9 at the White House. (Photo: Evan Vucci, AP) WASHINGTONÂ â Democratic senators are using the news of Paul Manafort's criminal convictions and Michael Cohen's guilty pleasÂ as a reason to try to delay a confirmation vote on Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii,Â announced Wednesday that she was cancelling her meeting with Kavanaugh because President Donald Trump ""does not deserve"" a meeting with his nominee after Tuesday's news about Manafort and Cohen. She called Trump ""an unindicted co-conspirator,"" apparently referring to the Cohen case. Cohen, who was Trump's personal attorney, pleaded guilty toÂ lyingÂ about his income to evade income taxes, lying to banks to obtain loansÂ andÂ making illegal contributions to benefit Trumpâs campaign.Â Manafort, who is Trump's former campaign chairman, was convicted of eight counts of tax and bank fraud. I have cancelled my meeting with Judge Kavanaugh. @realDonaldTrump, who is an unindicted co-conspirator in a criminal matter, does not deserve the courtesy of a meeting with his nomineeâpurposely selected to protect, as we say in Hawaii, his own okole. Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., also vowed Wednesday not to meet with Kavanaugh in the wake of Cohen's guilty pleas. It is customary for Supreme Court nominees to meet with as many senators as possible before the Senate votes on whether or not to confirm them. I will not take a meeting with Brett Kavanaugh. He has been nominated by someone implicated, and all but named as a co-conspirator, in federal crimes. His nomination is tainted and should be considered illegitimate. White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders called the meeting cancellations ""a desperate and pathetic attempt by Democrats to obstruct a very highly qualified nominee."" George Hartmann, a spokesman for Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, noted that Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer was confirmed by the Senate while then-President Bill Clinton's records were subpoenaed by a grand jury in the Whitewater investigation. ""Obviously, we are nowhere close to that situation today,"" Hartmann said.Â ""Calls to delay the hearing are just the latest tactic from opponents who decided to vote 'no' weeks ago, frantically looking for anything that sticks. The hearing will begin as planned on September 4."" Hirono said Kavanaugh was selected by Trump to ""protect, as we say in Hawaii, his own okole."" Okole is a Hawaiian term for a person's rear end.Â  Democratic senators have expressed concern that Kavanaugh's views on executive power could protect Trump from being subpoenaed to testify or hand over documents to special counsel Robert Mueller as part of Mueller's investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election. ""On the issue of executive power, on which Judge Kavanaugh seems to hold an almost unbounded view: I asked him whether he believed that a sitting president must comply with a subpoena to testify or provide records,"" said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. ""He would not say that the president must comply with a subpoena or provide records."" Both Schumer and Hirono said Grassley should delay Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings, which are set to begin on Sept. 4 and last for four days. Judge Kavanaughâs refusal to say a POTUS must comply w a duly issued subpoena & Mr Cohenâs implication of POTUS in a federal crime make the danger of Kavanaugh's nomination to the SCOTUS abundantly clear.It's a game changer & Chairman Grassley should delay confirmation hearings Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said Trump ""has been implicated"" in the Cohen case and that the Senate should not consider Kavanaugh's confirmation so soon. The President of the United States has been implicated in a criminal plot to violate campaign finance laws & influence the outcome of an election. Under no circumstances should we be considering his nomination of Judge Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court in just one week. Contributing: John Fritze",0.118,0.808,0.074,-0.9891,0.6001931972789116

John Cornyn of Texas spoke out as Democrats demanded an adjournment. Seventy people were arrested as protesters interrupted the proceedings. Brett Kavanaugh faces four days before the Senate Judiciary Committee. If approved, the conservative appeals court judge would be expected to tilt the court's balance to the right.  Minutes after Mr Kavanaugh, 53, entered the committee rooms on Tuesday, the hearing was disrupted by angry shouts from members of the public and lawmakers alike. The mostly female demonstrators shouted out that Mr Kavanaugh would allow President Trump to pardon himself.  Others claimed the judge would let people with pre-existing medical conditions be stripped of medical coverage. ""This is a travesty of justice!"" shouted one. Another cried: ""Our democracy is broken!"" Amid the almost continuous disruption, Texas Republican John Cornyn said it was ""the first confirmation hearing for a Supreme Court justice I've seen basically according to mob rule"". Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley of Iowa bridled at the suggestion he had lost control of the proceedings.  The US Capitol Police said 61 people were removed from the committee room and arrested for disorderly conduct.  A further nine were charged with crowding, obstructing or incommoding in the building. The Trump administration has refused to release thousands of documents about the judge's work for President George W Bush. The White House cited ""constitutional privilege"".  Democrats are demanding they be allowed to review the 100,000 documents about Mr Kavanaugh's record. They are also up in arms that some 42,000 documents were released to the committee just on the eve of the hearing. Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey said they would have had to read 7,000 pages an hour overnight just to review the files shared on Monday evening. But the panel chairman refused to delay the process.  Vermont's Democrat Patrick Leahy said it was the ""least transparent vetting for any Supreme Court nominee I have ever seen"". But Republican Senator Orrin Hatch dismissed the concerns raised about the judge as ""ridiculous"".  Democrats have warned that Mr Trump's choice will usher in a more socially conservative approach to abortion, gay rights and gun control. Senior Democrat Dianne Feinstein questioned in her opening remarks on Tuesday whether the nominee would leave the landmark Roe v Wade abortion law untouched if confirmed. The nine-justice court has until now been balanced between conservatives and liberals, with Anthony Kennedy considered the ""swing vote"". He retired in July.  They are also concerned about his argument in a 2009 legal article that a sitting president should be immune to prosecution.  President Trump said the judge's critics were ""despicable"".

End of Twitter post 2 by @realDonaldTrump In his opening statement, Mr Kavanaugh pledged to be a neutral arbiter of the law. ""The Supreme Court must never be viewed as a partisan institution,"" he said. ""The justices on the Supreme Court do not sit on opposite sides of an aisle."" He said: ""If confirmed to the Supreme Court, I will keep an open mind in every case. I will do equal right to the poor and to the rich.""  Mr Kavanaugh also told senators: ""My judicial philosophy is straightforward. A judge must be independent and must interpret the law and not make the law.""  Republicans have a slim majority in the 100-seat upper house. They can confirm Mr Kavanaugh if they stay united. So far, there are no signs of Republican defections.  Not all Democrats have said they will oppose Mr Kavanaugh, and several may even support his nomination.  The Senate is likely to vote on confirmation by the end of the month. The court begins its next term in October. More than 20 witnesses are being called for the coming days of hearings.  A resident of the wealthy Washington suburb of Chevy Chase, Mr Kavanaugh studied law at Yale.  He worked under special counsel Kenneth Starr in his investigation into President Bill Clinton's relationship with intern Monica Lewinsky in the 1990s.  Under George W Bush, he served as deputy White House counsel and, from 2003-06, as Mr Bush's staff secretary.

In a heated exchange Thursday morning, Democratic Sen. Cory Booker said he would release an email that had been designated committee confidential. That prompted Republican Sen. John Cornyn to snap, “Running for President is no excuse for violating the rules of the Senate or of the confidentiality of the documents we are privy to.” “I don’t ever plan on running for president in 2020 or at any point in the future,” North Carolina Republican Thom Tillis quipped minutes later when he also criticized Booker. During the past few days of hearings, all eyes have been on Kavanaugh. But he’s not the only person being evaluated. Democratic Sens. Booker, Kamala Harris of California and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, all widely considered to be potential presidential contenders in 2020, have each used their time in the highly publicized hearings to maximum effect to lay groundwork for a potential campaign. That has prompted an eye-roll from the Right. “Instead of treating the judge’s hearing seriously, they’re soaking up every minute of camera time to appeal to their far Left base,” said RNC spokesman Michael Ahrens. Read More: Can President Trump Pardon Himself? Kavanaugh Won’t Say Each senator played a different role in the dramatic piece of political theater. Booker’s 2020 persona was one of righteous indignation and idealism. During his lofty opening statement on Tuesday, Booker wound from the special counsel investigation to Russian election meddling to labor rights to healthcare to suicide rates among farmers to dark money to Martin Luther King Jr. to the Three-Fifths Compromise of 1787. “Right now millions of American families are watching this in sincere concern and fear,” Booker said, wearing a blue tie and sounding every bit the presidential candidate. “I’ve heard them, I’ve gotten the calls, I’ve traveled this country. I’ve talked to Republicans and Democrats… I’ve talked to workers all over my state, all over this nation.” (Booker also joked that he was a “trailblazer” because his statement was twice as long as the allotted time.) The following day, Booker zeroed in on racial injustice in his questioning of Kavanaugh, including pressing him on an email about racial profiling, which is the note that had been marked committee confidential that Booker broke the rule to release Thursday morning. Releasing committee confidential documents could result in expulsion from the Senate, but on Thursday Booker called it an act of civil disobedience and challenged Republican Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, “Apply the rule. Bring the charges.” It was a political dare to expel him in a blaze of glory, sure to endear him to voters on the Left. “This is the closest I will ever come to an ‘I am Spartacus’ moment,” Booker said. “No matter their stage personas, it’s clear that Senators Booker and Harris are not actually interested in hearing from the nominee, but rather want to continue giving their 2020 presidential stump speeches,” said conservative group Judicial Crisis Network’s Chief Counsel Carrie Severino. “They are turning their solemn constitutional duty to advise and consent into a made-for-TV circus.” It turned out to be even more of a political show than it had first seemed. Hours later, Bill Burck, George W. Bush’s representative who led the review of Kavanaugh’s documents, released a statement saying his office had cleared Booker’s release of the email the previous evening. “We were surprised to learn of Senator Booker’s histrionics this morning because we had already told him he could use the documents publicly,” Burck said. “Senate Republicans are doing everything they can to distract from their sham process to rush through a Supreme Court justice who will overturn Roe v. Wade, demolish the Affordable Care Act, and protect President Trump from being investigated,” said Kristin Lynch, Booker’s spokesperson. “Cory and Senate Democrats were able to shame the committee into agreeing to make last night’s documents publicly available, and Cory publicly released those documents as well as other committee confidential documents today. And he’ll keep releasing them because Republicans are hiding Brett Kavanaugh’s record from the American people.” If Booker seemed to be raising his hand for 2020 like the top student in class, Klobuchar was giving a more subtle nod from the back of the classroom. Klobuchar, wearing a blue jacket and top, publicly supported Booker during his act of civil disobedience on Thursday, saying that the hearing was “ramrodded through” for “political reasons.” And on Wednesday, Klobuchar pointedly used female pronouns to describe the president when she questioned Kavanaugh on hypotheticals about executive power. “You said in our meeting that Congress would likely act quickly if the president does something, in your words, ‘dastardly,’” Klobuchar said. “What about a president who commits murder? Or if she jeopardizes national security?” Klobuchar’s office did not response to request for comment. Another woman potentially vying for the top job: Harris. To make her mark on the hearings, Harris demonstrated her past as a prosecutor, highlighting her ability to ask tough questions and make opponents squirm under pressure. In a nearly eight-minute exchange on Wednesday, Harris grilled Kavanaugh on whether he had ever had a conversation with anyone at the law firm Kasowitz, Benson & Torres, which was founded by Donald Trump’s lawyer Marc Kasowtiz, about Robert Mueller’s investigation. As Kavanaugh hesitated, saying he didn’t remember, Harris said, “Are you saying with all that you remember— you have an impeccable memory, you’ve been speaking for almost 8 hours, I think more, to this committee about all sorts of things you remember— how can you not remember whether or not you had a conversation about Robert Mueller or his investigation with anyone at that law firm? This investigation has only been going on for so long, sir. “ Later, when Kavanaugh continued to stumble over response, Harris said, “I asked the question just a minute ago, I’m surprised you forgot.” And when he asked if Harris had a specific person in mind that he may have talked to, she replied, “I think you’re thinking of someone and you don’t want to tell us.” It was just the sort of tense exchange in which Harris, the former attorney general of California, thrives. “Under questioning from Senator Harris and Democrats, Judge Kavanaugh has been evasive, failed to answer simple questions, and demonstrated he’s a partisan who has executed a political agenda as a judge,” Tyrone Gayle, press secretary for Harris, tells TIME when presented with Ahrens and Severino’s comments. “It’s no wonder they are attempting to attack those who have questioned his record and his views.”",0.066,0.859,0.075,0.7925,0.39110433604336037

Brett Kavanaugh, 53, made the comments while working as a lawyer in 2003 for then-President George W Bush. His record is being closely examined as his appointment is seen as likely to tip the court towards the right. The Supreme Court is America's highest and has the final word on many contentious matters. Judges are appointed for their lifetime and getting his nominee approved would mark a victory for President Trump and his supporters. The email shows Mr Kavanaugh considering an opinion piece which states ""it is widely accepted by legal scholars across the board that Roe v Wade and its progeny are the settled law of the land"", referring to the landmark ruling that legalised abortion in the US. In response, Mr Kavanaugh says: ""I am not sure that all legal scholars refer to Roe as the settled law of the land at the Supreme Court level since court can always overrule its precedent, and three current justices on the court would do so."" The nominee is currently attending day three of a four-day confirmation hearing in Washington. Asked about the document, he repeated what he said on Wednesday that Roe v Wade was an ""important precedent of the Supreme Court, reaffirmed many times"". While campaigning for the presidency, Mr Trump promised to appoint pro-life judges, raising the possibility of Roe v Wade being overturned. Thursday's committee hearing began with Democrats threatening to release emails from Mr Kavanaugh detailing his time working as a White House lawyer. The emails are not classified but are considered ""committee confidential"", meaning they are only intended for senators and their staff, not the general public. Democrats, who have argued that the hearing should be delayed to allow them to completely review all of Mr Kavanaugh's records, released the emails after disputing the White House's claim that they pertain to national security. Emails released by Democrat Corey Booker show Mr Kavanaugh expressing concern about law enforcement's ability to conduct ""race-neutral"" policing policies in the years after the 11 September attacks. The 12-page email thread occurred under the subject line ""racial profiling"". Hawaii Democrat Mazie Hirono released emails showing the judge questioning whether native Hawaiians should have access to the same programmes available to other indigenous groups. Republicans bristled at the Democrats' unusual move, with Texas Senator John Cornyn accusing Mr Booker of ""conduct unbecoming of a senator"". ""Running for president is not an excuse for violating the rules of the Senate,"" said Mr Cornyn, calling the move ""irresponsible and outrageous"". Mr Booker said he was aware he could be ousted from the Senate over his decision, but struck a defiant tone. ""Bring the charges, go through the Senate process to take on somebody you said is unbecoming to be a Senator,"" he told his Republican colleagues.  ""Let's go through that process because I think the public should understand that at a moment someone is up for a lifetime appointment."" On Wednesday, Mr Kavanaugh refused to answer whether he thought presidents can pardon themselves if they face criminal charges.  In one exchange with Democrat Kamala Harris, he declined to answer whether he had had discussions about the special counsel's probe of alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 election.

Leahy. We watched the testimony of Judge Brett Kavanaugh before the Senate Judiciary Committee with dismay and disbelief. His many misleading and false statements cast serious doubt on whether he should be confirmed to a seat on the U.S. Supreme Court. The events of this weekend only make it clearer the Senate must not act in haste. At the very least, the Senate should not vote on his nomination until still-secret documents from his time in the George W. Bush White House are made public and until the sexual misconduct allegations that have just become public are thoroughly investigated. This is not about the dance many nominees attempt in order to avoid expressing an opinion on legal issues they might face on the court. It is about a pattern of deceptive answers on a range of questions about his past activities and agenda to change our laws through the courts. We believe this deception, both earlier this month and in his 2004 and 2006 nomination hearings for the D.C. Circuit, was intentional. His truthfulness, of course, is very much at issue in the latest allegations against him, since he has categorically denied the sexual assault of which he is accused. Kavanaugh’s nomination to the D.C. Circuit in July 2003 was highly controversial because of his role in very partisan matters, including judicial nominations. Emails revealed during the hearing, and some just a few weeks before, show that he went to great lengths to mislead Senators in 2004 and 2006 about his true role in those matters, as well as his knowledge of and reliance on confidential information about the strategy of Democratic Senators, whose files had been stolen by Manuel Miranda. Miranda, who worked closely with Kavanaugh on judicial nominations, was at the time a Republican staffer for Sen. Orrin Hatch and then the nominations counsel for Majority Leader Bill Frist. This is important because the American people need judges who are honest on both the facts and the law. Kavanaugh’s deception was about files that were stolen from the Senate itself and about his role promoting judicial nominees with very controversial records that caused their nominations to stall. Kavanaugh’s sworn testimony goes to the heart of the question of whether he should be entrusted with a lifetime job on our highest court. He should not. Miranda’s thefts over the period from December 2001 through early April 2003 were as serious an incident as we experienced during our congressional service — police tape was wrapped around the committee server room when the thefts were discovered. And an extensive report on the incident was issued by Senate Sergeant-at-Arms William Pickle in March 2004 the month before the Judiciary Committee’s first hearing on Kavanaugh’s nomination to the D.C. Circuit. Makan Delrahim, who President Donald Trump appointed last year to head the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice, worked for Hatch at the time of the theft. In connection with his nomination hearing, he said, “I find the misconduct described in the [Pickle Report] to be completely inappropriate, do not excuse it, and deeply regret that any such conduct by Senate Judiciary Committee staff occurred.” Chairman Hatch, Delrahim’s boss, concurred at the time of the report, saying in March 2004, “I am mortified that this improper, unethical, simply unacceptable breach of confidential files occurred.” At his first confirmation hearing in April 2004, Kavanaugh said he had never received material stolen from Democrats. He repeated that testimony in May 2006 under questioning by both Democratic Senators and Chairman Hatch. But emails released earlier this month, after originally being deemed “committee confidential,” show that Kavanaugh was in frequent contact with Miranda and received material that had been stolen from the Senate Judiciary Committee server. These emails contradict his testimony under oath. When confronted by Senator Leahy in the 2018 hearing, Kavanaugh stood by his earlier testimony, claiming that he never suspected the material he received was stolen and even arguing that it was “common” for the White House to receive strategic materials, like confidential letters or talking points, of Democratic staff. He repeated the claim that it was typical multiple times. He even testified: “It seemed like a lot of times the staff was cooperating at times … about judicial nominations. And so, it would not have raised anything in particular in my mind if we learned, Oh, Senator Leahy is concerned about this.” As former staffers who were there at the time, we find this testimony preposterous. While Democrats and Republicans worked together on non-controversial legislation and nominations, the fights over nominees Senators did oppose strongly — such as Miguel Estrada, Priscilla Owen, Bill Pryor and Charles Pickering — were full-fledged and often bitter on both sides. To suggest it would have been common to receive contents or descriptions of our memos, talking points, letters and other items about Democratic Senators’ strategies on how to defeat these highly controversial nominees is ridiculous. This is yet another deceptive claim by this nominee. Kavanaugh also misled the Senate in his 2006 nomination hearing about his involvement in pushing controversial nominees like Pryor and Pickering. Then, he said the Pryor nomination was not one that he had “worked on personally,” and that the Pickering nomination was not one that he had “primarily handled.” He denied awareness of Pryor’s incendiary comments that Roe v. Wade was the “worst abomination in the history of constitutional law,” and of Pickering’s unethical solicitation of recommendation letters from lawyers with cases pending before him as a trial judge. But this no longer appears true. The limited number of documents now available show that Kavanaugh interviewed and recommend Pryor for the 11th Circuit defended Pryor’s record to the Washington Post, drafted letters and prepared background material for Senators and their senior staff on Pickering, coordinated strategy with the Justice Department and the Judiciary Committee, and took part in or was invited to meetings about the nominees, including with Pickering’s son and other top supporters. All of this was known to Kavanaugh when he testified under oath in 2004 and 2006, but it was not known to Senators until emails contradicting his testimony were released this year. That Kavanaugh was pushing to nominate someone who made statements like Judge Pryor did about Roe v. Wade certainly casts doubt on his statement in 2004 that he rarely had knowledge of nominees’ ideological views Whether any of these statements should be the subject of federal charges for perjury or impeachment proceedings is a question for prosecutors, the courts and Congress. What is clear now, however, is that Brett Kavanaugh knew what he was being asked in his hearings and was intentionally evasive and misleading in his answers to questions under oath. Why would he do that? Because downplaying his participation in the most partisan and hard-fought judicial nominations of that period was a key part of the effort to secure his own spot on the federal bench. Had the documents that are now available to the public been seen by Senators in 2006, he very well might never have been confirmed to the D.C. Circuit. It is crucial to note that the Senate still does not have access to all of Kavanaugh’s records on these matters. The National Archives has estimated that it has millions of pages of documents from his time as a political appointee in the Bush White House. We simply do not know what’s still being hidden from the committee and the American people about these and other issues. What we do know is that Kavanaugh’s former Deputy, Bill Burck, has asserted a blanket claim of privilege on over 100,000 pages of documents, including those about Kavanaugh’s work on Bush judicial candidates. We are unaware of any previous time where executive privilege has been used to block the release of documents to the Senate during a Supreme Court nomination. It would be unprecedented and unwise for the Senate to act on the nomination without reviewing the full record. Furthermore, especially in light of the serious and credible charges that became public this weekend, it would be irresponsible for the Senate to rush this nominee to a vote with so many unresolved questions about his honesty and integrity. To uphold the integrity of the U.S. Senate’s nomination process, and maintain the integrity of the U.S. Supreme Court, Judge Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination must not move forward.",0.063,0.877,0.06,0.6869,0.4965975422427034

Dr. Christine Blasey Ford looks forward to working with you and the Committee. As you know, earlier this summer, Dr. Ford sought to tell her story, in confidence, so that lawmakers would have a fuller understanding of Brett Kavanaugh’s character and history. Only after the details of her experience were leaked did Dr. Ford make the reluctant decision to come forward publicly. In the 36 hours since her name became public, Dr. Ford has received a stunning amount of support from her community and from fellow citizens across our country. At the same time, however, her worst fears have materialized. She has been the target of vicious harassment and even death threats. As a result of these kind of threats, her family was forced to relocate out of their home. Her email has been hacked, and she has been impersonated online. While Dr. Ford’s life was being turned upside down, you and your staff scheduled a public hearing for her to testify at the same table as Judge Kavanaugh in front of two dozen U.S. Senators on national television to relive this traumatic and harrowing incident.

As the Judiciary Committee has recognized and done before, an FBI investigation of the incident should be the first step in addressing her allegations.

 Whatâs next for Brett Kavanaugh? The US supreme court nomineeâs path to the bench has been stalled by accusations that he tried to rape a girl when they were both in high school; that girl, now a professor in her 50s, initially tried to tell her story anonymously, but put her name to the charges when it became clear she was going to be outed anyway. Senate Republicans faced a quandary on Monday: reopen the Kavanaugh hearings and allow the woman to testify, potentially torpedoing his nomination and convincing more moderate Republicans to vote against him; pull his nomination entirely and start over with someone new, running the risk that they lose the Senate to Democrats in the coming months and see any far-right nomination rendered impossible; or push Kavanaughâs nomination forward and inevitably see significant blowback at the polls in November. The Republican party doesnât have a lot of good options. But they did the right thing and announced on Monday that they will reopen the hearings so that Kavanaugh and his accuser can testify before the judiciary committee next Monday. Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who wrote the initial letter to her congresswoman and California senator Dianne Feinstein alleging Kavanaugh assaulted her when she was a teenager, says she is willing to testify about her experience. Kavanaugh has offered a full denial, saying: âI have never done anything like what the accuser describes â to her or to anyone.â It is in the best interests of this process to fully air the accusations, with both Ford and Kavanaugh under oath. He is, after all, vying for a lifetime appointment to the highest court in the land, and so far, his confirmation process has been remarkably opaque and disturbingly superficial. Unlike supreme court justice Elena Kagan, who worked for the Clinton administration and released all of her White House communications during her confirmation process, Kavanaugh has not allowed a full look into his time working in the Bush White House. He was appointed by a president who may yet be indicted himself and who continues to preside over the country under a cloud of suspicion, deception and criminality. And now, he stands accused of attempted rape. The Trump administration has already undermined American confidence in so many of our institutions, and they seem to be gunning for democracy itself. The Kavanaugh hearings are a crucial moment for members of both parties to put a stop to this administrationâs habit of running roughshod over the very thing that makes our democracy admirable and functional (if occasionally maddening): fair, predictable and transparent processes. No one who has committed an act of violence against women should be in a position to make decisions about womenâs lives â even if they were a reckless teenager when they attacked a woman; even if theyâre very sorry; even if they are good people in myriad other ways. The promise of rehabilitation is always on the table, and people who do terrible things must always have the option of paying for their crimes, atoning fully and reintegrating into society. Itâs not asking too much to say that there should be a hard rule for judges: no rapists (or attempted rapists) allowed But Brett Kavanaugh isnât a criminal who has done his time and simply wants to be able to support himself. Heâs trying to sit on the highest court in the land. And itâs not asking too much to say that there should be a hard rule for judges: no rapists (or attempted rapists) allowed. As it stands, we of course donât know if Kavanaugh is guilty of what Ford says he did. Testimony from both of them will not bring about perfect clarity either. And if this were a criminal case, Kavanaugh would almost certainly walk away being declared not guilty â if charges were brought at all. There simply isnât much in the way of evidence beyond Fordâs word. But this isnât a criminal case, and whatâs at stake isnât the deprivation of Kavanaughâs life or liberty, but the privilege to hold one of the most important positions in the nation, for which good character and fair treatment of others is necessary. Kavanaugh has trotted out a slew of people attesting to his good character, making it clear that he and his Republican supporters believe who he is as a person is directly relevant to his fitness as a supreme court justice. Fordâs story, if true, would make him flat-out unfit to serve. Which is why it must be heard, and why senators who believe sheâs credible will then have an obligation to vote against Kavanaugh. This is more akin to a very important job interview than a criminal case. Fordâs testimony does not have to prove Kavanaugh guilty beyond a reasonable doubt; it just has to be credible and convincing enough to sway lawmakers. That is precisely what terrifies Republicans. But they have a duty to do this the right way â their office demands it, voters demand it, and the American democratic process requires it.",0.139,0.735,0.125,-0.9343,0.5889984258166077

Doubts were even raised whether she would appear. Meanwhile, Kavanaugh was at the White House for a second straight day. Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, said on radio’s “Hugh Hewitt Show” that he’d not yet received confirmation from the accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, that she would appear, despite several attempts to reach her camp. “So it kind of raises the question, do they want to come to the public hearing or not?” Grassley said. A day earlier, Republican abruptly agreed to hold a public Judiciary Committee hearing at which Kavanaugh and Ford have been invited to testify. Party leaders made that concession under pressure from senators demanding that the nominee and his accuser give public, sworn testimony before any vote on President Donald Trump’s nominee. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Democrats want more than two witnesses, including Mark Judge, who Ford has said was a Kavanaugh friend present during the alleged incident. Limiting the hearing to just Kavanaugh and Ford would be “inadequate, unfair, wrong and a desire not to get at the whole truth,” Schumer said. He also said the FBI should be given time to reopen its background investigation into Kavanaugh so it could check Ford’s assertions. And he said the Judiciary Committee should not rush the nomination through by voting on Kavanaugh a day or two after Monday’s hearing. As both sides contemplated the hearing, Republicans were thinking through the optics of a nationally televised showdown between Kavanaugh and his accuser at which all 11 GOP Judiciary Committee members are men. The hearing is certain to be conflicting and emotive. It will offer a campaign season test of the political potency of a #MeToo movement that has already toppled prominent men from entertainment, government and journalism and energized female voters and political candidates. Asked by Hewitt if he was considering including a female counsel who would ask questions, Grassley said, “All those things are being taken into consideration.” He added later, “You’re raising legitimate questions that are still in my mind.” Meanwhile, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell stood strongly behind Brett Kavanaugh, saying her claims that he’d sexually attacked her when both were high schoolers “stands at odds” with everything known about the Supreme Court nominee’s background. McConnell said that “blatant malpractice” by Democrats — not releasing a letter by the accuser until the confirmation process was nearing its end — “will not stop the Senate from moving forward in a responsible manner.” The remarks by McConnell, R-Ky., seemed aimed at signaling that while Ford will be given her opportunity to detail her allegations under oath, party leaders — certainly for now — were not easing off their support of President Donald Trump’s nominee. Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, who received Ford’s letter over the summer, said she didn’t reveal it to protect Ford’s confidentiality. Kavanaugh spoke with the Judiciary panel’s counsel Monday and gave a “clear and consistent” account of what happened 36 years ago, said a person who wasn’t authorized to be identified while describing the process. The person described Kavanaugh as “resolute” and eager to defend himself. Kavanaugh met Monday with White House Counsel Don McGahn and others at the White House and called several senators. Ford says that at a party when both were teenagers in the early 1980s, an intoxicated Kavanaugh trapped her in a bedroom, pinned her on a bed, tried to undress her and forced his hand over her mouth when she tried to scream. She said she got away when a companion of Kavanaugh’s jumped on him. Kavanaugh, 53, has vehemently denied the accusation. He said in a statement Monday that he wanted to “refute this false allegation, from 36 years ago, and defend my integrity.” If the Judiciary committee’s timetable slips, it would become increasingly difficult for Republicans to schedule a vote before midterm elections on Nov. 6 elections, when congressional control will be at stake. With fragile GOP majorities of just 11-10 on the Judiciary committee and 51-49 in the full Senate, Republican leaders had little room for defectors without risking a humiliating defeat of Trump’s nominee to replace retired Justice Anthony Kennedy. Among the GOP defectors was Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona, a Judiciary Committee member who has clashed bitterly with Trump and is retiring from the Senate. Flake said he told No. 2 Senate Republican leader John Cornyn of Texas on Sunday that “if we didn’t give her a chance to be heard, then I would vote no.” There was enormous pressure on GOP Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, two moderates who have yet to announce their positions on Kavanaugh and aren’t on the Judiciary Committee. Collins said that in a telephone conversation with Kavanaugh on Friday he was “absolutely emphatic” that the assault didn’t occur. She said it would be “disqualifying” if Kavanaugh was lying. Murkowski said Ford’s story “must be taken seriously.” Neither Collins nor Murkowski faces re-election this fall. Democrats say they want the FBI to investigate Ford’s claims. But the Justice Department said in a statement late Monday that the accusation against Kavanaugh “does not involve any potential federal crime.” It said the FBI had forwarded to the White House a letter, evidently from Ford, describing alleged misconduct in the 1980s by Kavanaugh. The statement seemed to suggest that the FBI was not currently investigating it. Ford is now a psychology professor at California’s Palo Alto University. Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, widely viewed as the nation’s second-most-powerful court.",0.064,0.857,0.079,0.8593,0.4118045112781954

 The Senate confirmation hearing of Donald Trumpâs choice to be the next judge on the US supreme court, ultra-conservative Brett Kavanaugh, has been a tumultuous affair. The event was marked by noisy protests, interruptions, âhandmaidsâ, a grieving father, a squirming nominee, a document dump and a master class in evasion. Here are the highlights of the week. â¢ Immediately before the hearing began on Tuesday morning on Capitol Hill, Democrats expressed outrage at the âhistorically secretive and opaqueâ vetting process of Kavanaugh, 53. Tens of thousands of documents about the judgeâs track record were released just the night before and many more remained withheld. â¢ Protesters dressed as handmaids, resembling the characters in the televised drama of Margaret Atwoodâs dystopian novel The Handmaidâs Tale, staged a silent demonstration. Their presence spoke volumes about the perceived threat of a conservative-leaning court to the landmark 1973 Roe v Wade decision that effectively legalized abortion in the US. Protesters wearing Handmaids Tale robes outside of the Supreme Court confirmation Heading for Brett Kavanaugh this morning pic.twitter.com/ZAKajK3Dy7 â¢ A few moments into the hearing, Democrats on the Senate committee repeatedly interrupted the Republican chairman to demand an adjournment on the grounds of the late document dump. Requests denied. Chaos ensued as protesters in the room jumped up, waving womenâs rights posters and screaming criticism of Kavanaugh and Trump. Seventy arrests were made during the morning inside and outside the hearing. â¢ Kavanaugh spent most of the day taking notes or sitting with a strange expression of displeasure as Democrats attacked. It read as a mix of horror and dismay, badly disguised as po-faced, as if someone had passed him a note in class saying: âItâs worms for dinner. By the way, no one likes you.â â¢ Further drama was only a lunch break away. As the hearing paused, the father of a student killed in the school shooting in Parkland, Florida, approached Kavanaugh, introduced himself and reached out to shake hands. Kavanaugh paused, stared at him, then turned abruptly without saying a word and walked out. â¢ Kavanaugh faced hours of intense questioning on Wednesday. He declined to say how he would rule on the legality of abortion and similarly dodged on whether the president has the authority to pardon himself. The atmosphere was calmer, but there were outbursts such as: âSham president, sham justice!â and âNo Trump puppet!â â¢ Californiaâs Democratic senator and former attorney general, Kamala Harris, opened her blistering grilling of the nominee with: âHas the judge ever spoken with anyone at Kasowitz, Benson &Torres â the law firm of Donald Trumpâs [former] personal attorney Marc Kasowitz â about the ongoing investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller?â Kavanaugh visibly squirmed, then spluttered. âIâm asking you a very direct question â yes or no?â Harris said icily. Kavanaugh obfuscated. â¢ Before the Thursday session began, the New York Times printed leaked confidential documents from Kavanaughâs stint in the George W Bush White House, in which he questioned whether the Roe v Wade decision on abortion was âsettled lawâ. And the New Jersey Democrat Cory Booker announced he would leak a confidential document containing Kavanaughâs thoughts on racial profiling, noting that he could be ousted from the Senate for doing so. â¢ Not to be outdone by handmaids, nine protesters stood outside the White House dressed in black judicial robes and Trump masks. âStop Trumpâs Supreme Court Takeoverâ - a protest outside the White House featuring 9 people in Trump masks and black robes #SCOTUS pic.twitter.com/RjZRWMfNQf â¢ Late on Thursday, the inquisition was over for Kavanaugh personally. Fridayâs session would hear from witnesses speaking against or in support of the judge. â¢ After all the hurly-burly, Kavanaugh now faces a vote by the full Senate, expected later this month. Republicans have a wafer-thin majority, with 51 of the 100 seats, and Kavanaughâs confirmation would be considered a major victoryfor the embattled president before the midterm election in November.",0.144,0.791,0.065,-0.996,0.3579091830155661

Over the weekend Christine Blasey Ford, a psychology professor at Palo Alto University in California, put her name to previously anonymous allegations of sexual misconduct from Kavanaugh at a high school party.   Kavanaugh ""categorically"" denied the allegation, and a classmate present at the party also dismissed the claim.   But for Kavanaugh, whose confirmation had already met stiff resistance from Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee, protestors who swarmed the hearings, and high-profile Democrats like Hillary Clinton misleadingly quoting him to paint him as anti-abortion, the allegation could tap the final nail in his bid's coffin.   As Republican Senators on the committee balk at hurrying towards the confirmation vote in the light of the fresh allegation, strategists advising Kavanaugh may try to push Ford to publically testify about the assault, Axios reports.   This move banks on Ford, who first requested anonymity, and is on the record as having discussed the event with a therapist, backing down. This would allow Republican senators to claim they tried to investigate the claims, but couldn't, according to Axios.   Ford, in a letter to Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein, to whom she is a constituent, accused Kavanaugh of physically restraining her and attempting to disrobe her with another person whose name has been redacted.   ""It is upsetting to discuss sexual assault and its repercussions, yet I felt guilty and compelled as a citizen about the idea of not saying anything,"" wrote Ford.

Susan Collins’ office during the confirmation hearings of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. So far, around 3,000 coat hangers have been sent to the Senator’s office in Maine over the course of a few months, according to the Associated Press. The coat hangers symbolize the danger of making abortion illegal again, serving as a reminder of the back-alley abortions that women resorted to before Roe v. Wade became settled law in 1973. Many fear that, if confirmed, Kavanaugh would work to overturn the established court case. Collins is a crucial swing vote in Kavanaugh’s confirmation to the court, along with Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski. Confirming a Supreme Court nominee takes just 51 votes and Republicans currently hold 51 seats. Either Collins or Murkowski, who are seen as more pro-choice than many other Republican Senators, could be the deciding vote in whether Kavanaugh is appointed to the court.  Collins has previously said she would not support a nominee that would not uphold Roe v. Wade. She also told reporters that Kavanaugh reassured her by saying he considers Roe v. Wade settled law, but in a 2003 email recently unearthed at his confirmation hearings he wrote he was “not sure” whether the case was settled law. People have been sending coat hangers to Collins’ office since July, when Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy announced his retirement. President Donald Trump has said if he is able to put a second or third justice on the court — he nominated Neil Gorsuch to the court earlier this year — Roe v. Wade being overturned would “happen automatically.” The Senate Judiciary Committee is expected to vote on Kavanaugh in the next few weeks.",0.027,0.904,0.069,0.9363,0.44027777777777777

Bush Administration was front and center the first day of his confirmation hearings, which was just how Democrats wanted it. Kavanaugh’s hearing began less than 24 hours after the Senate had received 42,000 pages of documents from Kavanaugh’s tenure, and three days after the White House asserted executive privilege and refused to release a hundred thousand documents. Those decisions were perfect fodder for Democrats, who have been pushing for a full release of these documents since President Donald Trump nominated Kavanaugh in July, to pounce. As Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley began reading his opening statement, he was interrupted by Democratic Sen. Kamala Harris, who asked him about the thousands of pages she’d received the night before. “We have not had an opportunity to review, or read or analyze,” she said. “We cannot possibly proceed.” “You’re out of order,” Grassley told Harris. But Harris persisted in pushing for delaying the hearing to review the documents. As Grassley continued to try reading his opening statement, every other Democrat on the committee, with the exception of ranking member Dianne Feinstein, who stayed above the procedural fray, followed Harris’ lead, calling for the hearing to be adjourned because they lacked the necessary information to make a decision. “What is the rush? What are we trying to hide by not having the documents out front? What are we hiding by not letting these documents come out?” Democratic Sen. Cory Booker asked Grassley. The partisan infighting over the seemingly mundane topic of document release isn’t new; its been the primary focus for Senate Democrats, led by minority leader Chuck Schumer, for nearly two months. Kavanaugh served in the White House Counsel’s office during the Bush Administration subsequently served as staff secretary; his paper trail was always going to be longer than any of the other nominees the President was considering after Justice Anthony Kennedy resigned from his position in June. Democrats said they wanted to see all of the documents from his time as White House staff secretary before the hearings, but Republicans did not request those documents, arguing they were irrelevant to his nomination. Although Senate Repulicans did ask for documents from Kavanaugh’s time in the White House counsel, the Democrats weren’t satisfied. The tension was only exacerbated after the National Archives said it would be unable to release all of the documents that the Senate had requested from Kavanaugh’s time in the White House counsel before October. Senate Republicans, who want to confirm Kavanaugh before the Supreme Court starts its new term in October, have instead been relying on the documents to be released through the Bush presidential library after they were reviewed by attorney William Burck, a process Democrats have deemed too partisan. Democrats still have an uphill battle to derail Kavanaugh’s nomination. Republicans need just 50 votes — their entire conference at the moment — to clear Kavanaugh’s nomination. The two Senators the Democrats had pinned their hopes on, Alaska’s Lisa Murkowski and Maine’s Susan Collins, don’t appear to have given any indication they won’t vote with their party. Additionally, several Democratic Senators are facing reelection battles in states where Trump won by double digits in 2016, meaning a vote against Kavanaugh could be potentially toxic for them. And on Tuesday, Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey announced he would appoint former Republican Sen. Jon Kyl to fill the late Sen. John McCain’s seat, giving Republicans even more of a cushion. But on Tuesday, Democrats were finally given a chance to tell the public why they are so intent on reviewing certain documents. “During your time in the White House, when you were staff secretary — some people regard it as kind of a monitor, monitoring things going in and going out. But I think it’s much more,” Feinstein told Kavanaugh in her opening statement. .”And you yourself have said that that’s the period of my greatest growth. And so we try to look at it. And the only way we can look at it is to understand the documents and it’s very, very difficult.”",0.036,0.894,0.07,0.9821,0.4660044320758607

The decision, which will likely push back the confirmation timeline – the committee was expected to vote on Kavanaugh’s nomination this coming Thursday – came one day after Ford publicly identified herself in an interview with the Washington Post as the woman who had written a letter to Sen. Dianne Feinstein describing her alleged ordeal with Kavanaugh when they were in high school. Ford told the Post Sunday that she and Kavanaugh were at a high school house party in the 1980s when Kavanaugh, who she says had been drinking, pinned her to a bed and groped her in an effort to pull off her clothes. When she tried to scream, Ford told the Post that Kavanaugh put his hand over her mouth. “As I said earlier, anyone who comes forward as Dr. Ford has done deserves to be heard …. to provide ample transparency, we will hold a public hearing Monday to give these recent allegations a full airing,” Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley said in a statement Monday evening announcing the evening. Kavanaugh, who has denied the incident ever occurred, had said in a statement released through the White House Monday that he was willing to testify as soon as possible. Ford’s attorney, Debra Katz, said Monday morning on cable television that her client was willing to do so as well. She did not immediately respond to request from comment for TIME.  Grassley’s decision capped off a hectic day in the Senate that was filled with calls from senators on both sides of the aisle who wanted to hear from both Ford and Kavanaugh about the elections. Those pushing for testimony included Sens. Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski, two members of the Republican conference Democrats have targeted as possibilities for bucking the party line and voting against Kavanaugh. “Allegations surrounding sexual assault must be taken seriously and the Judiciary Committee must look into this further. Despite the length of time since the alleged incident, Dr. Ford’s allegations should be heard and she must have an opportunity to present her story before the committee under oath, with Judge Kavanaugh having the opportunity to respond under oath as well,” Murkowski said in a statement Monday. Collins said it would it be “disqualifying” if Kavanaugh had lied about the allegations, but said she did not have information to asses the veracity of Ford’s allegations.  “I believe in order for me to assess the credibility of these allegations that I want to have both individuals come before the senate judiciary committee and testify under oath,” she told reporters in the Capitol Monday. Feinstein’s office did not immediately respond to request for comment. All of the Democrats on the judiciary committee sent a letter to Grassley earlier in the day asking to delay the hearing until the FBI conducted a thorough investigation. At the end of the day, they had also sent a letter to White House Counsel Don McGahn to ask the FBI to re-open Kavanaugh’s background check. And Democrats refused to attend the meeting where judiciary staffers questioned Kavanaugh on the allegations, claiming the efforts weren’t sufficient. When asked earlier in the day if committee Democrats would be satisfied with a hearing instead of re-opening an FBI investigation, a spokesperson for Feinstein said the focus was on the FBI and declined to discuss any hypotheticals.",0.03,0.938,0.032,0.2591,0.4418390804597701

Over the weekend a psychology professor at Palo Alto University in California put her name to previously anonymous allegations of sexual misconduct from Kavanaugh at a party when he was in high school.   The woman, Christine Blasey Ford, on Monday offered through her lawyer to testify publicly to the Senate Judiciary Committee and ""do whatever it takes to get her story forth,"" according to CNN.   Kavanaugh has ""categorically"" denied the allegation, and a classmate present at the party also dismissed the claim.

Three Democratic sources familiar with the Senate Judiciary Committee's planning  told HuffPost that Republican senators are looking to have women question Ford. But every Republican senator on the committee is male, so doing to would require senators' aides to step in.   The party is reportedly looking to avoid aggressive questioning of Ford as she accuses Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her while they were in high school as it could potentially backfire on the party.  The committee has 11 Republican members, including Chairman Chuck Grassley, all of whom are men. There are 10 Democrats on the committee, four of whom are women.   Republicans are also considering other options for questioning Ford. Republican Senator John Cornyn of Texas told HuffPost: ""We've discussed various options, including hiring outside lawyers and supplementing that with senators asking questions.   So, any senator who wants to ask questions remains free to do so. But I don't want want to get in front of the chairman.""   It is not yet clear if Ford will testify in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee, though both she and Kavanaugh have said that they are  willing to do so.   Lawmakers had been waiting Ford's response to their request for  a public hearing set for Monday.  The likelihood that Ford will agree to a hearing on Monday may have been reduced after her lawyers wrote a letter on Tuesday night that said  a federal investigation must be conducted before any hearings.

I believe this is a copy for full transparency.” Ford came forward to The Washington Post on Sunday, putting her name on an allegation that had been circulating anonymously since Wednesday. According to Ford, during a party in the early 1980s, Kavanaugh pinned her to a bed, groped her over her clothes and attempted to undress her. “I thought he might inadvertently kill me,” Ford, now 51, told the Post. “He was trying to attack me and remove my clothing.” Kavanaugh has denied Ford’s allegation. “I categorically and unequivocally deny this allegation. I did not do this back in high school or at any time,” he said in a statement. Senator Dianne Feinstein, the leading Democrat on the committee overseeing Kavanaugh’s confirmation, has called Ford’s allegation “extremely serious” and that they “bear heavily on Judge Kavanaugh’s character.” Feinstein received a letter detailing Ford’s claim in July, but the allegation contained therein was not widely known until last week. While Democrats and numerous protestors have tried to delay or derail Kavanaugh’s nomination process, the Trump-nominated judge’s eventual ascension to the Supreme Court was seen as inevitable given Republicans’ control of the Senate. However, Ford’s allegation could lead the Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee to reconsider their support for Kavanaugh. Ford’s lawyer said on CNN Monday morning that Ford would be willing to testify in front of that committee.

Christine Blasey Ford accused Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her nearly four decades ago at a high school party. Both are now slated to testify at a public hearing on Monday — a situation that has elicited comparisons to Hill’s testimony, where she faced intense scrutiny and changed the national conversation about sexual harassment. Kavanaugh has denied the allegation, calling it “completely false.” “Today, the public expects better from our government than we got in 1991, when our representatives performed in ways that gave employers permission to mishandle workplace harassment complaints throughout the following decades,” Hill wrote in the Times. “That the Senate Judiciary Committee still lacks a protocol for vetting sexual harassment and assault claims that surface during a confirmation hearing suggests that the committee has learned little from the Thomas hearing, much less the more recent #MeToo movement.” Hill noted some of the members that were on the Senate Judiciary Committee when she testified in 1991 are still on the committee including Vermont Sen. Patrick Leahy, Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch and Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley. She urged the Senate Judiciary Committee not to pit the need for a fair confirmation hearing against the need to confront sexual harassment, calling for a “neutral investigative body with experience in sexual misconduct cases” to investigate Ford’s accusation. She also said Senators should rely on those investigative conclusions and expert advice when framing their questions. “The investigators’ report should frame the hearing, not politics or myths about sexual assault,” Hill wrote. She urged Senators not to rush the hearings, warning that a Monday deadline does not allow “enough time for meaningful inquiry into very serious charges.”  “In 1991, the phrase ‘they just don’t get it’ became a popular way of describing senators’ reaction to sexual violence,” Hill wrote. “With years of hindsight, mounds of evidence of the prevalence and harm that sexual violence causes individuals and our institutions, as well as a Senate with more women than ever, ‘not getting it’ isn’t an option for our elected representatives. In 2018, our senators must get it right.”",0.15,0.794,0.056,-0.9928,0.5993632174277335

The Times' source added that Ford has also received supportive messages after giving her account of the alleged incident: ""Ninety percent of people think she's a hero and are extremely supportive of her, and 10 percent want her to die immediately,"" the person told the newspaper.   In July, Ford initially wrote about her allegation in a letter that was eventually sent to Sen. Diane Feinstein of California, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee.

The lawyers wrote that Ford, who is now a college professor in California, wants to cooperate with the committee. But in the days since she publicly accused Kavanaugh of the assault when they were teens at a party 35 years ago, the lawyers said, she has been the target of “vicious harassment and even death threats.” Her family has relocated, they said. An FBI investigation “should be the first step in addressing the allegations,” the lawyers wrote in the letter, which was obtained by The Associated Press. The development comes after President Donald Trump showered sympathy on his embattled nominee and as Senate Republicans and Democrats fought determinedly over who should testify at a high-stakes hearing on the allegation just six weeks before major congressional elections. Trump has already rejected the idea of bringing in the FBI to reopen its background check of Kavanaugh. Should he order such a review, it would likely delay a confirmation vote until after the election. Republicans hope to have Kavanaugh confirmed by Oct. 1, the start of the next Supreme Court term. Meanwhile, Republicans are suggesting that Ford, whose allegations have upended Kavanaugh’s nomination — the committee’s vote was already pushed from Thursday to likely next week — will have one chance to testify, and one chance only. “Monday is her opportunity,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said Tuesday, a line that was echoed by other Republicans throughout the day. McConnell expressed confidence that Kavanaugh would be confirmed. “I’m not concerned about tanking the nomination,” he said. “We should proceed as planned,” said Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, a key Republican on the panel. The furious jockeying over Ford’s testimony underscores the political potency so close to an election that will decide control of both the House and Senate, not to mention the confirmation of a conservative justice likely to serve on the high court for decades. Democrats complain that Ford was not consulted before the hearing was announced. They also want more witnesses besides Kavanaugh and Ford, hoping to avoid what they said would turn into a “he-said-she-said” moment. The lawyers for Ford predicted the hearing, as now scheduled, “would include interrogation by senators who appear to have made up their minds” that she is “mistaken” and mixed up. But Democrats also said Tuesday they were planning to attend the hearing even if Ford did not show up. Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said he had “a lot of questions” for Kavanaugh. “A simple denial is not the end of questioning.” As Democrats press for more time to investigate, Republicans have been careful to say that Ford should have her chance to speak, and they have stressed that they are willing to move Monday’s hearing behind closed doors, if she prefers. “Were planning on a hearing Monday. It can be open. It can be closed, whatever Ms. Ford wants,” said Sen. John Kennedy, a member of the Judiciary panel from Louisiana. “We’re ready to hear anything she has to say. I am, anyway, and I think most of us are.” GOP Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee — among a handful of Republicans who insisted on hearing from Ford before voting — said it would be a “shame” if Ford didn’t show up to testify. But he suggested Republicans will not bend from their offer of a hearing Monday. “That would be quite something if she decided she did not want to testify,” Corker said. “I’d assume the committee would then move on as they should.” One witness the Democrats want to hear from is Kavanaugh’s high school friend Mark Judge, who Ford said was in the room when she was assaulted. Kavanaugh has denied Ford’s allegation, and Judge says he doesn’t remember any such thing. “More to the point, I never saw Brett act in the manner Dr. Ford describes,” Judge said in a letter to the panel. The risks of a public hearing starring the all-male lineup of Republicans on the committee could be high. Republicans said late Tuesday they were considering hiring outside attorneys, presumably including women, to question the witnesses. But that may be moot if Ford declines to appear. Kavanaugh, 53, was at the White House on Tuesday for a second straight day, but again did not meet with Trump. The president said he was “totally supporting” Kavanaugh and felt “terribly” for him and his family. “I feel so badly for him that he’s going through this, to be honest with you, I feel so badly for him,” said Trump, who has himself faced numerous accusations of sexual harassment that he’s denied. “This is not a man that deserves this.” The No. 2 Senate Republican leader, John Cornyn of Texas, was one of the few Republicans who openly questioned Ford’s version of events. He called the allegations a “drive-by attack” on the judge’s character. “There are gaps in her memory,” Cornyn said. “She doesn’t know how she got there, when it was and so that would logically be something where she would get questions.” Criticism like that fed a Democratic narrative that the GOP’s handling of Ford could jeopardize that party’s election prospects in the age of #MeToo, the response to sexual abuse that has torched the careers of prominent men. “Now this is really what #MeToo is all about, if you think about it,” said Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, the top Judiciary Committee Democrat. “That’s sort of the first thing that happens, it’s the woman’s fault. And it is not the woman’s fault.” Meanwhile, Kavanaugh has been calling Republican senators, including Kennedy, who said the nominee was committed to moving forward. “He’s not happy, he’s upset,” Kennedy said. “He said very clearly and unequivocally, ‘This did not happen.'” Ford went public with her story Sunday, telling The Washington Post that Kavanaugh had forced himself on her in a bedroom at a party when he was 17 and she was 15, attempting to remove her clothes and clapping his hand over her mouth when she tried to scream. She says she escaped when Judge jumped on the bed.",0.074,0.874,0.052,-0.9856,0.488896447467876

    USA TODAY President Donald Trump gestures while speaking at the Harris Conference Center in Charlotte, N.C., Friday.(Photo: Pablo Martinez Monsivais, AP) WASHINGTON (AP) â The Trump administration is withholding more than 100,000 pages of Brett Kavanaugh's records from the Bush White House on the basis of presidential privilege ahead of the Supreme Court nominee's confirmation hearing. The Senate Judiciary Committee was notified of the action Friday. George W. Bush's attorney Bill Burck told the panel it had essentially completed its work compiling documents, according to a letter obtained by The Associated Press. Bush directed them to err ""on the side of transparency and disclosure, and we believe we have done so.""

In an interview on ""Good Morning America"" Wednesday morning, Hill, now a professor at Brandeis University, said she thinks the Senate Judiciary Committee should ""push the pause button"" on Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings and have the FBI thoroughly investigate the claim Christine Blasey Ford has made.    Ford, a well-respected psychologist, claims that Kavanaugh attempted to rape her at a high school party in the 1980s. Kavanaugh has firmly denied the claim. Ford's lawyer said her client was willing to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but that the FBI should conduct an investigation first.   Hill agreed with that course of action on Wednesday, saying ""a neutral investigation that can pull together the facts"" is ""the right move"" so senators can develop their questions off of that.   ""Also helpful would be bringing in expert testimony or experts who can help them shape the questions that they're going to ask,"" Hill said. ""All of this is really something that I don't think can be avoided if you really want to get to the truth.""  Hill testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1991, when she accused then Supreme Court-nominee Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment.AP  So far, it appears that the Republican majority will not be taking that course of action. On Tuesday, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley said there's ""no reason for any further delay"" on Kavanaugh's confirmation.   Hill warns that if they push Kavanaugh's confirmation hearing through, it will come across as a ""sham.""                                                                                                                                   She then drew comparisons to her own testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1991, which came just five days after she accused then Supreme Court-nominee Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment in the workplace. After the highly publicized hearing, Thomas was confirmed anyway.   The committee invited Kavanaugh and Ford to testify next Monday, just a little more than a week after she publicly accused him in the Washington Post.  Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh has been accused of attempting to rape Christine Blasey Ford in the 1980s. He has denied the allegation.J. Scott Applewhite/AP  Hill said ""anyone who has been involved in anything similar to this"" knows that it takes time to come to the truth, especially for ""senators who probably know very little about these kinds of claims.""   She said they should halt Kavanaugh's confirmation so they can have a hearing ""that is impartial, that is not biased by politics or by myth."" By pushing Kavanaugh's hearing through ""at this pace,"" Hill said, the American people ""are really under the impression that the Senate doesn't take this seriously.""                                                                                                                                   Thoroughly investigating the claim is important because the outcome of the confirmation ""will change the trajectories of both of their lives,"" Hill said. She pointed out that Ford's life has already been impacted, since she's had to move her family into hiding after receiving death threats.   It will also affect Americans at large, because of the power the Supreme Court holds.   ""We are talking about an appointment for a lifetime on this nation's highest court, making decisions that are going to affect Americans probably for decades given the value of precedent. It is an honor and a privilege to be nominated and to serve, it is not an entitlement,"" Hill said.   She continued: ""And so a person coming into that position on the Supreme Court for a lifetime really has to have the full confidence of the American public. We need to be able to believe in the integrity of our courts, and that means believing in the integrity of the individuals who are on it.""   ",0.082,0.814,0.104,0.9502,0.4895426065162906

Ford's attorney's wrote a letter to Sen. Chuck Grassley, the Republican chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, saying an FBI investigation would ""ensure that the crucial facts and witnesses in this matter are assessed in a non-partisan manner"" and would be critical ""before conducting any hearing or making any decisions.""   ""We would welcome the opportunity to talk with you and Ranking Member Feinstein to discuss reasonable steps as to how Dr. Ford can cooperate while also taking care of her own health and security,"" the letter reportedly said.   ""What we're saying is there should be an investigation because that's the right thing to do,"" Lisa Banks, Ford's attorney, told the CNN host Anderson Cooper. ""She is prepared to cooperate with the committee and with any law-enforcement investigation.""   Sen. Diane Feinstein of California, the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, cosigned Ford's request for an investigation.   ""We should honor Dr. Blasey Ford's wishes and delay this hearing,"" Feinstein said in a statement on Tuesday. ""A proper investigation must be completed, witnesses interviewed, evidence reviewed, and all sides spoken to. Only then should the chairman set a hearing date.""   The letter also confirmed that Ford, a mother of two teenagers, had been targeted with death threats since coming forward against Kavanaugh, whom President Donald Trump nominated for the Supreme Court in July after Justice Anthony Kennedy announced his retirement.   Earlier Tuesday, The New York Times reported that after coming forward, Ford had moved out of her house and arranged for a private security detail after she received vulgar emails and messages on social media.   Ford's accusation prompted the Judiciary Committee to delay its planned Thursday vote on Kavanaugh's confirmation. A public hearing is scheduled for next Monday, and both Kavanaugh and Ford were expected to testify after both had indicated a willingness to do so. Before the letter from Ford's attorneys, however, lawmakers had been in limbo after multiple messages for Ford to appear at the hearing went unanswered.                                                                                                           Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, the Republican chair of the Senate Finance Committee, pushed back on Ford's request for an FBI investigation. ""The FBI does not do investigations like this. The responsibility falls to us,"" Hatch wrote, reiterating Grassley's offer to let Ford testify before the Judiciary Committee.   ""We should proceed as planned,"" he said.   The Justice Department said in a statement on Monday that the sexual-assault allegation ""does not involve any potential federal crime"" to warrant an FBI investigation, according to the Associated Press. It added that the department's role in conducting background investigations during the nomination process was to determine whether the nominee might be a national security risk.   Ford has said Kavanaugh was ""stumbling drunk"" during a small party in high school at which he pinned her to a bed, groped her over her clothes, and covered her mouth with his hand when she started to scream.   Kavanaugh has categorically denied Ford's claim and said he would testify to ""refute this false allegation.""                                                                                                           A full investigation would be unlikely to conclude before Monday's planned public hearing. Key witnesses have appeared reluctant to discuss the incident or have no memory of it.  Mark Judge, a former classmate of Kavanaugh's who became implicated in the allegation, has signaled he is unwilling to appear before the Judiciary Committee.   ""I have no more information to offer the committee and I do not wish to speak publicly regarding the incidents described in Dr. Ford's letter,"" Judge said in a statement.

By Peter H. Schuck Mr. Schuck is an emeritus professor of law at Yale. Commentary on Supreme Court nominations these days is more akin to sportscasters announcing a close baseball game: âThe liberals and conservatives are tied going into the bottom of the ninth. Brett Kavanaugh, a promising rookie pitcher with a strong minor league record, is coming in to replace the streaky Anthony Kennedy. When Kennedy was hot, the conservatives won, but when he slumped, the liberals could squeeze by. Kavanaugh seems a lot steadier than Kennedy.â This way of handicapping Supreme Court nominees has a definite allure. We all love a horse race, and politics often seems like one. But for court nominations, sports analogies are dangerously misleading. It is true that knowing the party of the president and the nominee provides a strong indication of how the nominee will later vote in cases of sharp partisan differences on the underlying policy issue â for example, the recent Janus v. Afscme decision barring a union from imposing agency fees on nonmembers.  But in 75 percent of cases, partisan affiliation is not fully predictive of justicesâ votes. In the hardest ones, lower courts reached different results despite seeing the same evidence, and considering the same legal arguments. This week, senators should spend less time grandstanding with questions that simply highlight Judge Kavanaughâs well-known ideological positions, and a lot more time trying to assess how he would vote in these much trickier cases. What accounts for these âcircuit splitsâ? In hard cases, excellent legal arguments (not just ideological ones) can be made on both sides, often because the relevant legal principles are unclear or conflicting. Also, judges (and administrative agencies initially) can reasonably interpret the key facts differently. The competing values (there may be more than two) may be compelling. Most justices care about a decisionâs legal and social consequences, yet in hard cases these effects may be opaque and unpredictable â perhaps because they depend on what the states decide to do.  In some hard cases â Brown v. Board of Education or same-sex marriage, for example â the legal and social landscape may have shifted so much that even conservative justices, who normally resist âliving Constitutionâ arguments, may take these changes into account. In clashes between national security and individual rights claims (e.g., the recent travel ban decision), even liberal justices may defer to the governmentâs judgment. And it is hard to predict how courts will apply the multiple criteria â what Judge Kavanaugh referred to in his testimony this week as âprecedents on precedentsâ â for deciding when precedents may be overturned. This is why even some conservative justices may resist overturning Roe v. Wade. (They may try to eviscerate it in other ways, of course.)  And, of course, even on the Supreme Court, politics has a way of trumping ideology in unpredictable ways. Who would have expected that Chief Justice John Roberts would seek out a way to rescue the Affordable Care Act in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius? Media and politicians have traditionally tended to ignore these complexities, preferring to depict a Manichaean liberal/conservative battle for legal supremacy. This perverse ideological focus hides or denies the fascinating interplay among legal doctrine, textual interpretation and the factual record in determining outcomes. It also crowds out the more revealing lawyerly divisions among the justices about what should matter in resolving hard cases â for example, the relative importance of national uniformity versus local diversity, of clear rules versus more contextual standards, of government authority versus individual rights, of deference to elected officials versus bureaucratic expertise, of the default rules for interpreting ambiguous language, and so forth.  Ideological labels are even misleading in their own terms. Real judges (like real people) mix liberalism on some issues with conservatism on others. For example, even the arch-conservative Antonin Scalia voted with liberals to uphold punitive jury awards against product manufacturers, adopting the position advocated by the trial lawyers (a leading Democratic lobby), because he thought the Constitution permits such awards.  The labels also reveal little about what should be our real concerns: the mix of values underlying them. For example, is a âlaw-and-order conservativeâ callous toward the life challenges faced by poor people, or instead sensitive to the depredations that crime inflicts on their communities? Is race-based affirmative action a policy that levels the playing field for all or instead one that advantages some minorities over others?  None of this means that partisan decision patterns donât exist. But it does argue for a more nuanced view of a nominee, one that includes factors beyond partisanship. President Trump has selected the kind of reliably conservative jurist that one would expect any Republican president to nominate. Judge Kavanaughâs right-wing supporters and left-wing opponents are equally keen to portray him as a guaranteed vote to overrule Roe and other liberal shibboleths, but hard cases often cause justices to confound ideological expectations. John Paul Stevens, David Souter and Anthony Kennedy, all justices nominated by Republican presidents, took the âliberalâ side in important cases. (Such unexpected shifts have probably become less likely with more intensive ideological screening by outside groups.) Once confirmed, Judge Kavanaugh will enjoy total independence from any president. Had a ânormalâ president nominated him rather than a bizarre, lawless one, this nomination would be no more controversial than, say, Elena Kaganâs â another superbly qualified choice. Unless the Democrats come up with something disqualifying, he should be confirmed.  Peter H.

By Paul Krugman Opinion Columnist At a fundamental level, the attempt to jam Brett Kavanaugh onto the Supreme Court closely resembles the way Republicans passed a tax cut last year. Once again we see a rushed, nakedly partisan process, with G.O.P. leaders withholding much of the information thatâs supposed to go into congressional deliberations. Once again the outcome is all too likely to rest on pure tribalism: Unless some Republicans develop a very late case of conscience, they will vote along party lines with the full knowledge that theyâre abdicating their constitutional duty to provide advice and consent. True, Kavanaugh is at least getting a hearing, which the tax bill never did. But heâs bobbing and weaving his way through, refusing to answer even straightforward questions, displaying an evasiveness utterly at odds with the probity we used to expect of Supreme Court justices. No, the real difference from the tax bill story is that last year we were talking only about a couple of trillion dollars. This year weâre talking about the future of the Republic. For a Kavanaugh confirmation will set us up for multiple constitutional crises. After all, if Kavanaugh is confirmed, we will be trying to navigate a turbulent era in American politics with a Supreme Court in which two seats were effectively stolen. First Republicans refused even to give President Barack Obamaâs nominee so much as a hearing; then they will have filled two positions with nominees chosen by a president who lost the popular vote and eked out an Electoral College win only with aid from a hostile foreign power.  [Receive the dayâs most urgent debates right in your inbox by subscribing to the Opinion Today newsletter.]  Would a Justice Kavanaugh conduct himself with the caution appropriate to such a fraught situation? Well, miracles of personal redemption do happen. But itâs very unlikely. On the contrary, every indication is that if he makes it, he and his fellow justices will abuse their power at every level. After all, what do we know about Kavanaugh? Thereâs a lot we donât know, thanks to the unprecedented way Republicans and the Trump administration are stonewalling on thousands of pages of his records. And whatâs in those hidden records must be really damning, given what we already know â a record that would, in normal times, be more than enough to rule him out as a potential member of the nationâs highest court. Remember, Kavanaugh cut his teeth working for the Starr investigation into Bill Clinton â a genuine witch hunt that consumed seven years and tens of millions of dollars without finding any evidence of wrongdoing. And he personally spent years obsessively pursuing crazy conspiracy theories about the suicide of Vince Foster. Then he spent time working in the George W. Bush White House, which made torture a routine part of policy. In his 2006 confirmation hearing for an appellate court judgeship he declared that he played no role in those decisions. Was he telling the truth? The answer might lie in those thousands of pages of records the Trump administration is refusing to release.  Strange to say, however, he emerged from that experience as someone who believes that presidents canât be subject to legal investigations. Meanwhile, Kavanaugh accumulated a record as an appellate judge â one that places him far to the right on everything from the environment, to labor rights, to discrimination. His anti-labor views are especially extreme, even for a conservative. So who is Brett Kavanaugh? If he looks like a right-wing apparatchik and quacks like a right-wing apparatchik, heâs almost surely a right-wing apparatchik. Which brings us to the coming constitutional crises. The immediate question is how the court will handle Donald Trumpâs obstruction of justice, which is likely to reach epic levels very soon. If you think Kavanaugh wouldnât completely support Trump, I have some miracle dietary supplements you might want to buy. Beyond that, what will happen if we eventually get a Democratic Congress and president, who try to move forward with a center-left agenda? What I mean by that, by the way, are things like expanding health coverage and raising taxes on high incomes â things that arenât radical, and in fact have broad popular support. Thereâs every reason to believe that a court including Kavanaugh would strike down everything elected officials tried to do. Policy substance aside, this would destroy the courtâs legitimacy, making its naked partisanship â based, again, on two stolen seats â clear to all. But it would probably happen anyway. In fact, the constitutional carnage might well begin as soon as next year. We know that if Republicans hold on in the midterms theyâll quickly move to destroy Obamacare and take insurance away from millions. But even if they lose, what are the odds that if Kavanaugh is confirmed, the court will find some excuse to declare the Affordable Care Act unconstitutional? Surely theyâre pretty high. So let me make a last-minute appeal to Republican senators who care about Americaâs future, if there are any left: Donât do this. A vote for Kavanaugh will be a vote to destroy the legitimacy of one of the last federal institutions standing.

By The Editorial Board The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section. In a more virtuous world, Judge Brett Kavanaugh would be deeply embarrassed by the manner in which he has arrived at the doorstep of a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court. He was nominated by a president who undermines daily the nationâs democratic order and mocks the constitutional values that Judge Kavanaugh purports to hold dear.  Now heâs being rammed through his confirmation process with an unprecedented degree of secrecy and partisan maneuvering by Republican senators who, despite their overflowing praise for his legal acumen and sterling credentials, appear terrified for the American people to find out much of anything about him beyond his penchant for coaching girlsâ basketball.  Perhaps most concerning, Judge Kavanaugh seems to have trouble remembering certain important facts about his years of service to Republican administrations. More than once this week, he testified in a way that appeared to directly contradict evidence in the record.  For example, he testified that Roe v. Wade is âsettled as a precedent of the Supreme Court.â But he said essentially the opposite in a 2003 email leaked to The Times. âI am not sure that all legal scholars refer to Roe as the settled law of the land at the Supreme Court level since Court can always overrule its precedent, and three current Justices on the Court would do so,â he wrote then. Judge Kavanaughâs backers in the Senate brushed this off by pointing out that his 2003 statement was factually correct. Theyâre right, which means that his testimony this week was both disingenuous and meaningless. As weâve learned with each new trickle of previously withheld documents, Judge Kavanaugh didnât start misleading senators just this week.  At his 2004 confirmation hearing before the Judiciary Committee, he denied any involvement in the vetting of a controversial judicial nominee while serving as one of President George W. Bushâs White House lawyers. The nominee, William Pryor Jr., had among other things called Roe v. Wade âthe worst abomination of constitutional law in our history.â In fact, Mr. Kavanaugh was more than a little involved, as emails from that period â which Senate Republicans had withheld until early Thursday morning â made clear. In that 2004 hearing and again in 2006, when he was being considered for a seat on the federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., Mr. Kavanaugh told Congress, under oath, that he knew nothing about the extensive theft of secret strategy documents from Democratic senatorsâ computers by Republican staffers. As it turns out, he did in fact receive those documents or summaries of them. But he now claims that he had no reason to believe that they had been stolen, even though one email he got had the subject line âspyingâ and began, âI have a friend who is a mole for us on the left.â  Then there are the persistent doubts about his truthfulness in telling senators in 2006 that he had no knowledge of Mr. Bushâs warrantless wiretapping program or his detainee treatment policy â claims that have been called into question by yet more emails, which showed he knew about both of those things years before they became public.  As Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois told Judge Kavanaugh on Thursday, âYou say that words matter. You claim to be a textualist when you interpret other peopleâs words, but you donât want to be held accountable for the plain meaning of your own words.â Judge Kavanaugh was quick to provide lawyerly explanations for all of these discrepancies, but they paint a pattern thatâs hard to ignore: He misstates facts under oath, and Republicans cover for him by making it hard, if not impossible, to get the documents proving it. With the help of the White House and a personal lawyer for Mr. Bush, Senator Chuck Grassley, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, has subverted a long-established, nonpartisan process and hidden more than 90 percent of the material pertaining to Judge Kavanaughâs time in government.  Itâs only thanks to Senate Democrats and others that weâve been able to see important pieces of the judgeâs lengthy paper trail. There is far more that was never even requested. Far from being embarrassed by all this, Judge Kavanaugh is acting like someone who knows there is virtually nothing he can do to imperil his nomination. Instead, heâs followed his own cynical advice to a 2002 judicial nominee: âShe should not talk about her views on specific policy or legal issues,â he wrote in an email then. âShe should say that she has a commitment to follow Supreme Court precedent, that she understands and appreciates the role of a circuit judge, that she will adhere to statutory text, that she has no ideological agenda.â That is more or less how Judge Kavanaugh got through his hearings. But his ideological agenda is well known, which is precisely why heâs been on Republican Supreme Court shortlists for the last decade. That agenda includes, for starters, a well-established hostility to womenâs reproductive rights and a stunningly expansive view of presidential power and impunity. Republicans defend their steamrollering by saying that most Democrats have already made up their minds to oppose Judge Kavanaugh. Thatâs rich: In the months before the 2016 election, multiple high-ranking Republican senators openly vowed to block any and all Supreme Court picks by Hillary Clinton, period. Itâs also irrelevant. The people deserve to know everything possible about nominees to a lifetime seat on the highest court in the land, and they depend on their senators to seek out that information and share it.  The Constitution calls this process advice and consent. Until the last few years, Republicans claimed to take that responsibility seriously. Now they are making a mockery of what is meant to be a careful and deliberative process by playing three-card monte with the American people. They did the same with last yearâs tax bill, rushing it through in the dead of night with virtually no debate or review.  The Republicans engage in this sort of subterfuge for an obvious reason: While they hold unified power in Washington, most of their agenda is hugely unpopular. So they hide as much of it as possible out of a fear that if more of it came to light, they will pay at the polls. Come November, voters can make that fear come true.

 Senators on the Judiciary Committee pressed Judge Brett Kavanaugh about the constitutional right to abortion and his views on the special counsel. â¢ The third day of confirmation hearings for the Supreme Court nominee Brett M. Kavanaugh, and the second day of senatorsâ questioning, began at 9:30 a.m. and stretched late into the night. â¢ The release of documents once marked âcommittee confidentialâ fortified Democratic questions on abortion, affirmative action and whether Judge Kavanaugh knew of Republican aidesâ theft of Democratic computer files. â¢ Many of those confidential documents spilled out in an anonymous release to The New York Times. Judge Kavanaughâs abortion views created a stir outside the hearing room. Adding to the concerns of abortion rights advocates was a Kavanaugh reference to contraceptives as âabortion-inducing drugs.â He was answering a question from Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, about his dissent in a case involving Priests for Life, a religious organization that objected to a regulation under the Affordable Care Act requiring many employers to provide free insurance coverage for contraception to their female workers. Advertisement The group had objected to an accommodation offered by the Obama administration that allowed it to obtain a waiver by completing a form. Advertisement âThey said filling out the form would make them complicit in the provision of the abortion inducing drugs that they were as a religious matter objecting to,â Judge Kavanaugh testified. Some religious organizations regard any form of birth control as an abortifacient. But Judge Kavanaughâs use of the term âabortion-inducing drugsâ set off alarm bells among abortion rights advocates and spawned a hashtag, #abortioninducingdrugs, on Twitter. Erica Sackin, director of political communications for Planned Parenthood of America, commented on Twitter: 
            BIG FLAG: #Kavanaugh just called birth control ""abortion-inducing drugs""         Judge Kavanaugh would not say whether he thought the Supreme Courtâs 2015 decision establishing a constitutional right to same-sex marriage had been correctly decided. But he tried to convey sympathy for gay rights by quoting from a Supreme Court decision in June that sided with a Colorado baker who refused to create a wedding cake for a same-sex couple. The ruling did not address the central dispute in the case and turned instead on apparent hostility against religion in a state civil rights commission. Judge Kavanaugh focused on one statement in the majority opinion, written by Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, the member of the court he hopes to replace. âOur society has come to the recognition that gay persons and gay couples cannot be treated as social outcasts or as inferior in dignity and worth,â Justice Kennedy wrote. Judge Kavanaugh noted that Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justices Samuel A. Alito Jr. and Neil M. Gorsuch, all members of the courtâs conservative wing, had joined the opinion. And he suggested that he agreed with the sentiment, too. Amid the arcane discussions of Supreme Court precedent and judicial philosophy, the Kavanaugh hearings did have some lighter moments. Advertisement Senator John Kennedy, Republican of Louisiana, had some probing questions about Judge Kavanaughâs past: âDid you ever get in trouble? Were you more of a John Boy Walton type or a Ferris Bueller type?â The judge didnât bite. Mr. Cruz asked Judge Kavanaugh if he intends to play basketball at the court inside the Supreme Court building. No sitting justice has played there, Mr. Cruz said, since Justice Clarence Thomas, âmany years ago, when he was a much younger justice.â Judge Kavanaugh said that if confirmed, he does indeed intend to play, on what is known as âthe highest court in the land.â And speaking of basketball, Judge Kavanaugh is exceedingly proud of the girlsâ basketball teams he has coached through the Catholic Youth Organization at his home parish, Blessed Sacrament in Chevy Chase, Md. About a dozen current and former players â in blue sweaters, ponytails and plaid skirts â showed up to watch. They sat in the front rows, right behind their coach. Judge Kavanaugh introduced each of them, rattling off their names and, in a remarkable display of memory not devoted to legal precedent, their grades. âLetâs see,â he said. âWeâve got Liza going into fifth grade. Keeganâs in fifth. Annaâs in seventh. Shawnee is in seventh. Quinn is in sixth. Sophie is in seventh. So I think I got it all right.â The room broke out into applause. In documents obtained by The New York Times that date back to Judge Kavanaughâs time in the George W. Bush administration, Mr. Kavanaugh, then a White House aide, seemed to raise doubts about whether Roe v. Wade, the landmark Supreme Court ruling that found a constitutional right to an abortion, was âsettled law.â He was considering a draft opinion piece to be run under the names of anti-abortion women that stated, âit is widely accepted by legal scholars across the board that Roe v. Wade and its progeny are the settled law of the land.â Responding to the email, the future Supreme Court nominee wrote, âI am not sure that all legal scholars refer to Roe as the settled law of the land at the Supreme Court level since Court can always overrule its precedent, and three current Justices on the Court would do so.â Advertisement The documents do not indicate how Judge Kavanaugh would rule, but they are fodder for Democratic questioning. Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, asked Mr. Kavanaugh about the document, noting it had been made public. Mr. Kavanaugh defended the statement he made in the email, and said âthe broader point was simply that it was overstating something about legal scholars.â âIâm always concerned about accuracy, and I thought it was not an accurate description of all legal scholars,â he said, adding later that Roe v. Wade is âan important precedent. It has been reaffirmed many times.â He declined to comment directly on Ms. Feinsteinâs questions as to whether it is âcorrect law.â NARAL Pro-Choice America, the abortion rights lobby, jumped on the release immediately: âBrett Kavanaughâs emails are rock solid evidence that he has been hiding his true beliefs and if he is given a lifetime seat on the Supreme Court, he will gut Roe v. Wade, criminalize abortion, and punish women. Everything he said yesterday in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee about âsettled lawâ was nothing but a show to mislead the Senate.â [Read more about the documents, here.] A tantalizing moment on Wednesday came when Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, asked Judge Kavanaugh whether he had meetings with Manuel Miranda, a former Senate Republican aide who was caught stealing files from the computers of Senate Judiciary Committee Democrats, including Mr. Leahy. Judge Kavanaugh denied ever knowingly receiving stolen material when he was a White House aide tasked with getting President George W. Bushâs judicial nominees confirmed. On Thursday, questioning Judge Kavanaugh a second time, Mr. Leahy described and put up on posters several emails about his interactions with Mr. Miranda, indicating that he had received permission from the committee chairman around 3 a.m. to disclose them. They included a March 2003 email from Mr. Miranda to Judge Kavanaugh that included several pages of Democratic talking points, marked ânot for distribution,â and another to Judge Kavanaugh from a Republican Senate staff member whose subject line âspyingâ and which referred to âa mole for us on the left.â 
            Subject: spying pic.twitter.com/GuIGHCjwiE  Judge Kavanaugh reiterated that he had no knowledge that Mr. Miranda had infiltrated Democratic files, saying he likely assumed that the Republican staff was getting information from friends who were Democratic staff members and nothing had raised red flags at the time. Advertisement âI was born at night but not last night,â Mr. Leahy said. âIf I had something that somebody said, we have stolen this or donât tell anybody we have this, I think it would raise some red flags.â Mr. Leahy also pressed him about more than 100,000 documents from his period as a Bush White House lawyer that the Senate has not been permitted to see, even on a confidential basis, because a lawyer for President Bush has said they are subject to executive privilege. Mr. Leahy asked whether Judge Kavanaugh could confirm that none of those contain more such emails from Mr. Miranda.  Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address.

View all New York Times newsletters. âSenator, I am not involved in the documents process,â Judge Kavanaugh. âI donât know whatâs in them.â Replied Mr. Leahy: âThat is convenient.â Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, pressed Mr. Kavanaugh on comments he made in support of Justice Antonin Scaliaâs dissent in a case that upheld the constitutionality of an independent counsel. âGiven your views on Morrison v. Olson, we are obviously worried you will feel bound by this dissent by Scalia if President Trump decides to attempt to fire the special counsel Bob Mueller,â Mr. Durbin said. Mr. Kavanaugh began by pushing back on the framing of Mr. Durbinâs question, noting that case involved the creation of an independent counsel, not a special counsel. But ultimately, he assured the senator, âIâve made clear in my writing that when a court order requires a president to do something or prohibits a president from doing something under the constitution or laws of the United States, that is the final word.â When it comes to the scope of executive power, he said, âI am one not afraid at all in my record of twelve years to invalidate executive power when it violates the law.â Later, under questioning from Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware, Judge Kavanaugh pushed back against what he called a misinterpretation of a comment he made at a 1999 round table, when he said, âMaybe Nixon was wrongly decided â heresy though it is to say so.â He was referring to the 1974 case of United States v. Nixon, where the Supreme Courtâs ruled unanimously that a sitting president, Richard M. Nixon, could be subpoenaed for documents and records like the Watergate tape recordings. Judge Kavanaugh said he was being wry, and critiquing the strategy of lawyers for President Bill Clinton during the investigation of that president. âThe tone of voice there has made the printed word look much different than how it was intended,â he said, adding that he believes the case was correctly decided, and is âone of the four greatest decisionsâ in Supreme Court history. (He did not say what the other three are.) Advertisement Much of the morning was given to what appeared to be real drama, the move by Senator Cory Booker, Democrat of New Jersey, to release âcommittee confidentialâ documents without Republican permission â and Republican threats to exact consequences. After all, such a release could result in Mr. Bookerâs expulsion from Senate. âBring it,â the senator said. Senators Booker and Mazie K. Hirono, Democrat of Hawaii, went ahead and released the documents. âThis is about the closest Iâll ever come in my life to an âI am Spartacusâ moment,â Mr. Booker declared. But after the drama subsided, Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said all of those documents were cleared for release overnight. William A. Burck, the former Bush White House lawyer tasked with reviewing the Kavanaugh documents, said in a statement, âWe cleared the documents last night shortly after Senator Bookerâs staff asked us to. We were surprised to learn about Senator Bookerâs histrionics this morning because we had already told him he could use the documents publicly. In fact, we have said yes to every request made by the Senate Democrats to make documents public.â The question remains, so why were Republicans handing Mr. Booker his moment, not saying, hey, whatâs the big deal? As for Mr. Booker, his spokeswoman gave him credit for forcing the documentsâ release â and said this would not be the last of the document kerfuffles. âCory and Senate Democrats were able to shame the committee into agreeing to make last nightâs documents publicly available, and Cory publicly released those documents as well as other committee confidential documents today,â the spokeswoman, Kristin Lynch, said in a statement. âAnd heâll keep releasing them because Republicans are hiding Brett Kavanaughâs record from the American people.â Advertisement Late in Wednesdayâs proceedings, the questioning finally reached Senator Kamala Harris, Democrat of California, and she launched into tense questioning that centered around whether Judge Kavanaugh had ever discussed the Russia investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, with a lawyer or lawyers from the law firm of President Trumpâs longtime personal lawyer, Marc Kasowitz. 
            Has Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh had a conversation about Robert Mueller or his investigation with anyone at Trump's personal attorney's law firm?We donât know. He refused to answer my question. pic.twitter.com/PAKxDGvEtZ  Judge Kavanaugh appeared somewhat baffled, but he would not offer a blanket ânoâ because he said he didnât know the names of every lawyer who worked for the firm, and he had discussed the Mueller investigation with lawyers and judges. âI think youâre thinking of someone, and you donât want to tell us,â Ms. Harris said without elaboration. Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, gave Judge Kavanaugh an opportunity on Thursday to revisit Ms. Harrisâs line of questioning. Mr. Kavanaugh responded by acknowledging he doesnât know everyone who works at the firm, but said, âI donât recall any conversations of that kind.â âI havenât had any inappropriate conversations about that investigation with anyone,â Judge Kavanaugh said. âIâve never given anyone any winks, hints, forecasts, previews, nothing, about my view as a judge, or how I would rule as a judge on that or anything related to that.â A spokesman for Kasowitz Benson Torres said in a statement Thursday that âthere have been no discussions regarding Robert Muellerâs investigation between Judge Kavanaugh and anyone at our firm.â In a letter last June to Mr. Mueller, Mr. Kasowitz cited a majority opinion by Judge Kavanaugh, without naming him, saying, âThe President may decline to prosecute certain violators of federal law just as the President may pardon certain violators of federal law. The President may decline to prosecute or may pardon because of the Presidentâs own constitutional concerns about a law or because of policy objections to the law, among other reasons.â The question is, can and will the senator tell the public what she knows? Most Supreme Court nominees express enthusiasm for cameras in the court at their confirmation hearings, only to change their minds after they join the court. Judge Kavanaugh took a different approach, saying only that âI will have an open mind on it.â Advertisement He said his current court, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, has recently allowed live audio coverage of its arguments. That development, he said, was a positive one. But he offered only vague comments on electronic coverage of the Supreme Court. The court generally releases audio recording of arguments at the end of the week and does not allow camera coverage. Judge Kavanaugh made one novel suggestion, offering that the court should consider camera coverage of the sessions in which the justices summarize their opinions from the bench. The court, which currently releases audio of those sessions months later, is unlikely to adopt the idea. The justices may be wary of suggesting to the public that their informal oral summaries, rather than their written opinions, precisely set out the details of decisions.

By Katherine Stewart Ms. Stewart is the author of âThe Good News Club: The Christian Rightâs Stealth Assault on Americaâs Children.â On day two of the confirmation hearings for Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh, President Trumpâs second nominee to the Supreme Court, Senator John Cornyn of Texas brought up the 2000 case Santa Fe Independent School District v. Doe, in which the court ruled that sectarian prayers at high school football games violated the clause of the First Amendment that prohibits the establishment of religion. Mr. Cornyn repeated Chief Justice William H. Rehnquistâs complaint that the decision âbristle[d] with hostility to all things religious in public life.â In fact, the plaintiffs in the case identified as Catholic and Mormon, and it is safe to say that they were not hostile to religion, but to the presumption that one religion speaks for all. Judge Kavanaugh, eager to signal his agreement with Mr. Cornyn, tossed back the catch phrase that Mr. Cornyn appeared to be fishing for: âreligious liberty.â Over the course of this weekâs Senate confirmation hearings, the other senator from Texas, Ted Cruz, repeatedly identified Judge Kavanaugh as a jurist who would uphold âreligious liberty.â That should concern anyone who cares about actual freedom, religious and otherwise. What senators Cornyn, Cruz and other religious conservatives mean by âreligious libertyâ is its opposite. If the Senate confirms Brett Kavanaugh, it will be declaring that the United States is a nation in which one brand of religion enjoys a place of privilege; that we are a nation of laws â except in cases where the law offends those who subscribe to our preferred religion; and that we recognize the dignity of all people unless they belong to specific groups our national religion views with disapproval. When a pharmacist refuses to fill a prescription on the basis of his own religious beliefs, according to todayâs Christian nationalists, that is a shining example of âreligious liberty.â It is not. When a Catholic hospital delays or refuses to perform a legal and medically indicated procedure on a woman suffering a miscarriage on the grounds that the procedure violates its religious directives, that isnât religious liberty. When a private school that miseducates students with scientifically illiterate and historically inaccurate theories claims a public subsidy, or a Medicare-supported retirement home turns away a lesbian couple, that isnât religious liberty, either. Letâs call it by its true name: religious privilege, not religious liberty. Todayâs Christian nationalists want the ability to override the law where it conflicts with their religious beliefs, and thus to withdraw from the social contract that binds the rest of us together as a nation. This kind of religious privilege has a history. In the Jim Crow south, for example, when black doctors and black patients were routinely shunted to inferior hospitals, many people justified the practice in terms of their sincerely held âbiblicalâ belief that God intended for the races to be forever separated. Religious privilege of this sort was never intended for all belief systems, but rather for one type of religion. Sure, its advocates will on occasion rope in representatives of non-Christian faiths to lend the illusion of principle to their cause. But the real aim and effect of the religious liberty movement is to advance their idea of religion at the expense of everyone else. If your religion or deeply held moral beliefs include the view that all people should be treated with equal dignity, then this religious liberty wonât do anything for you. If youâre a taxpayer who helps to fund your local hospital, a patient who keeps it in business, or a professional who works there, then your sincerely held religious and moral conviction that all people are entitled to equal access to the best medicine that science can provide and the law permits wonât stand a chance against a Catholic bishopâs conviction that some procedures are forbidden by a higher authority. Todayâs Christian nationalists will insist they are the only victims here. But that is as false as it is lacking in compassion. The terribly real effect of the kind of religious supremacy they seek is to target specific groups of people as legitimate objects of contempt. L.G.B.T. Americans, women and members of non-favored religions may be able to get the services they need from some other pharmacist or cake decorator or retirement home or emergency room â at least we have to hope so. But what they wonât get back is the equal dignity to which they are entitled â and thatâs the point. President Trump, as part of his kickback to the white evangelicals who got him elected, has fashioned this idea of religious supremacy into a cornerstone of his shambolic administration. In January 2018, the Department of Health and Human Services set up an office designed to make it easier for health care professionals to deprive their clients of medical services, including birth control and other forms of reproductive care, on the basis of religious belief. In July, Attorney General Jeff Sessions followed up with his own Religious Liberty Task Force. Already the Department of Labor is assuring federal contractors that itâs all right to violate anti-discrimination law as long as they can claim they did it on account of an implicitly defined set of religious or deeply held moral beliefs. All of these detestable initiatives, however, are really just a preview of the damage Brett Kavanaugh would be able to deliver from the Supreme Court. To understand the significance of Judge Kavanaughâs nomination, you have to know something about how he got to this crowning point in his career. Judge Kavanaugh comes from a hothouse carefully tended by the ideologues of the Federalist Society and given the stamp of approval by Mr. Trumpâs court evangelicals and conservative Catholics. Having lost the so-called culture war on womenâs and L.G.B.T. rights among the general public, Christian nationalists understand that the only way for their regressive views to dominate is if they control the courts. The confirmation process brought to you by todayâs Republican Party only serves to confirm the antidemocratic nature of Judge Kavanaughâs appointment. Republicans defaulted on their Constitutional obligation to advise and consent on the nomination of Judge Merrick Garland. But now they are aiming to push Judge Kavanaughâs through without anything close to a full revelation of his documentary trail. The part of the trail that is visible confirms that Judge Kavanaughâs theoconservative backers have chosen a candidate who will advance their agenda. There was a time when Thomas Jeffersonâs âwall of separation between church and stateâ was part of the furniture of American constitutional thought. Only a grumbling minority talked about tearing it down. But in a recent speech, Judge Kavanaugh seized on a dissenting opinion in which his judicial hero, Justice Rehnquist, argued that the wall metaphor was âbased on bad historyâ and âuseless as a guide to judging.â In his dissenting opinion in Priests for Life v. Health and Human Services, Judge Kavanaugh argued that requiring an organization to fill out a one-page form that would have exempted it from providing contraception coverage imposed a âsubstantial burdenâ on its free exercise of religion. He appears to feel keenly the anguish of priests and nuns living in a nation where women have a range of lawfully and medically supported health care options. But in Garza v. Hargan, he thought it was no real burden for a minor, pregnant and in federal custody, to be denied access to the abortion she desperately wanted in order for the government to search for a sponsor, rather than arrange for her medical treatment directly. In that same decision â thankfully slapped down by the full bench of the court on which he sat â Judge Kavanaugh characterized abortion as a âmomentous life decisionâ and referred contemptuously to abortion rights as âabortion on demand.â That is precisely how âreligious libertyâ works today. You maximize the moral anguish of those whose religion and values you favor and minimize the rights and suffering of those you disfavor. Judge Kavanaughâs performance in his confirmation hearings served only to amplify these concerns. In answer to Mr. Cruzâs invitation to discuss âreligious liberty,â Judge Kavanaugh spoke movingly about the suffering of those who were prevented from bringing their religion into âthe public square.â But he had next to nothing to say about the benefits that have flowed to all of us from the many landmark decisions that have prevented religious groups from using the power of the state to impose their views. He endorsed the appeal to âhistory and traditionâ in justifying the mixing of religion and government functions, but showed no awareness that such appeals invariably confer privilege on those religions best able to claim this history for themselves. He celebrated recent rulings that establish the right of religious groups to participate in âpublic programs,â but failed to note that the concerns those rulings raise have to do with the use of taxpayer funds by religious groups whose beliefs are not universally shared â and whose discriminatory practices are at odds with laws that apply to the rest of the nonprofit (and for-profit) world. In response to Mr. Cornyn, Judge Kavanaugh gave favorable mention to the Supreme Court decision in the Good News Club v. Milford Central School case. At one time, public elementary schools largely excluded these clubs in response to Establishment Clause concerns. The Good News decision required the schools to open their doors to evangelical clubs, which gives young children the false but unavoidable impression that their school endorses one religion above all others. For Judge Kavanaugh, who wrote an amicus brief in the case while in private practice, this was a victory for religious liberty, presumably available to all other religions. But in the real world, few other religious groups have thought it appropriate to emulate the Good News Clubâs strategy in going after other peopleâs elementary-age children in their public schools. And those who have tested identical strategies â the Satanic Temple tried it in 2016 â have effectively had the school doors slammed in their faces. Judge Kavanaughâs disdain for the separation of church and state will matter in decisions that go well beyond the usual battlegrounds in the culture war. He has expressed enthusiastic support for school voucher programs, for example, which are ways of pretending to reform education while funneling money from the public purse to religious organizations. Judge Kavanaughâs record shows he also has a special place in his heart for the mystical belief systems of corporations. He endorsed the Hobby Lobby decision, which allowed that corporation to use its religious beliefs to deny birth control coverage to its employees. There is another vision of America, one where we come together as a people to solve as many of the problems that we face as we can. In an America that must still exist somewhere in our collective imagination, no group of individuals is singled out to be stripped of their dignity. In this America, we treat everybody equally under the law and we expect everyone to follow it. Citizens are free to exercise their religion, but not to impose it on other people or to fund it at public expense. The choice before the Senate is whether we continue to advance this vision of an open and tolerant America or stamp this low moment in our political history on the highest court of the land.

SHEARSEPT. 5, 2018
 Judge Brett Kavanaugh faced questions from the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath about his legal opinions on major issues. â¢ Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee for the second day of his Supreme Court confirmation hearings, where he defended his judicial independence amid questions over how he would treat President Trump on the high court. â¢ Senators have pressed Judge Kavanaugh on guns, abortion and regulation, as well as some tantalizing questions over purloined emails. Each senator has 30 minutes to interrogate Judge Kavanaugh. Protests continued intermittently. â¢ For more analysis of the day, read here. Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, raised two Bush-era scandals with Judge Kavanaugh, and he suggested that Bush White House emails in the Judiciary Committeeâs possession may contradict testimony the nominee made more than a decade ago â if only they could be released publicly. The exchange was tantalizing but incomplete. One of the scandals was the disclosure in late 2003 and 2004 that a Republican Judiciary Committee staff member had infiltrated the Democratsâ confidential internal files about which of President George W. Bushâs judicial nominees to try to block and with what tactics. The other was the disclosure that after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, the Bush administration had secretly ordered the National Security Agency to intercept Americansâ phone calls and emails without obtaining the judicial warrants seemingly required by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Advertisement At his appeals court confirmation hearing in 2006, Judge Kavanaugh â who had worked as an associate White House counsel in the Bush administration â told senators that he did not know anything about the infiltration of Senate Democratsâ files on judicial nomination fights or about the warrantless wiretapping program before they eventually became public. Advertisement But Mr. Leahy indicated that documents marked âcommittee confidentialâ show that Manuel Miranda, then a Republican staffer on the Judiciary Committee, had sent Judge Kavanaugh emails about Mr. Leahyâs private concerns about a judicial nominee whose hearing was coming up and a draft letter Mr. Leahy had not yet sent. He also suggested that the files may show that Mr. Miranda made a reference to having a mole on the committee or spying on Democrats, and that Mr. Miranda may have suggested meeting outside of their workplaces. The senator also indicated that Mr. Kavanaugh may have had some involvement with a memo written by John Yoo, who was an attorney in the Justice Departmentâs Office of Legal Counsel who wrote opinions secretly blessing the surveillance program as lawful. Judge Kavanaugh insisted that everything he had testified before was â100 percent accurate,â but indicated that he was not sure what Mr. Leahy was referring to. Mr. Leahy asked Mr. Grassley to lift the confidentiality protections over the emails in question so he and Judge Kavanaugh could discuss them in his second round of questioning, and Mr. Grassley indicated he would look at them. âI am concerned because there is evidence that Mr. Miranda provided you with materials that were stolen from me,â Mr. Leahy said. âAnd that would contradict your prior testimony. It is also clear from public emails â and Iâm refraining from going into nonpublic ones â that you had reason to believe materials were obtained inappropriately at the time.â Judge Kavanaugh, under attack from progressives and Democrats who say he will roll back abortion rights, asserted that he understood the significance of the issue and would respect the Supreme Courtâs âprecedent on precedent.â âI donât live in a bubble. I understand I live in the real world,â he said, after Ms. Feinstein reminded him of the âdeath tolls in this countryâ among women who tried to end their own pregnancies before Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 decision establishing a constitutional right to abortion. âI understand your point of view on that and I understand how passionate and how deeply people feel about this issue,â he said. Senator Feinstein did not ask him the operative question â Does he believe Roe was correctly decided? â but even if she had, he had already told Senator Grassley it would not be appropriate to answer it. She did ask him what he meant when he told Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, that he believed Roe was âsettled law.â At that, he launched into a discourse on the value of precedent. Advertisement Judge Kavanaugh said that Roe was âsettled as a precedent of the Supreme Court,â and as such, deserves respect from judges who took note of it. But then he noted a subsequent case, the 1992 case of Planned Parenthood v. Casey, which narrowed the scope of Roe, at the same time that it reaffirmed Roe as a precedent. Casey, which gave states the authority to regulate abortion so long as those regulations do not pose an âundue burdenâ on the woman, is âprecedent on precedent,â he said. His comments were a reminder that, as Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader, has often pointed out, precedents are only settled law until the Supreme Court unsettles them. Democrats complain that previous nominees have pledged to respect precedents, only to narrow or overturn them once seated on the court. One opinion of intense interest to Democrats is Judge Kavanaughâs dissent in the 2017 case Garza v. Hargan, which involved a pregnant, 17-year-old undocumented immigrant whom the Trump administration tried to block from having an immediate abortion. Judge Kavanaugh sided with the administration in arguing that the teen should have been transferred to the care of an âimmigration sponsorâ â a family member or friend â before being allowed terminate her pregnancy. Under questioning from Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, he said he was only following Supreme Court precedent, though he conceded, âThere is no case on exact point.â So, Judge Kavanaugh said, he rooted his dissent in Supreme Court cases that have permitted states to require pregnant teens to obtain the consent of their parents for an abortion. Mr. Durbin objected, suggesting that Texas, where the girl was housed in an immigration facility, had imposed no such requirement on her. âYou are adding a requirement here,â the senator said. âIâm not adding. Iâm a judge. The policy has been made by others,â Judge Kavanaugh replied. âIâm deciding whether the policy is consistent with Supreme Court precedent.â âI did my level best in an emergency posture,â he added. Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, put that question directly to Judge Kavanaugh. Advertisement If Mr. Leahy thought he was going to get a direct answer to the direct question, he was mistaken. 
            Leahy: ""President Trump claims he has an absolute right to pardon himself. Does he?""Kavanaugh: ""The question of self-pardons is something I've never analyzed. It's a question I have not written about... It's a hypothetical question that I can't begin to answer in this context"" pic.twitter.com/N91BYOuqKV  âThe question of self pardons is something Iâve never analyzed,â Judge Kavanaugh said, adding: âI canât begin to answer in this context as a sitting judge and a nominee to the Supreme Court.â Mr. Leahy pressed anyway, asking whether the president could pardon associates to keep them from testifying against him. Again, Judge Kavanaugh dodged the question, saying that as a judge, he would normally receive briefs and arguments from both sides before coming to a conclusion. âIâm not going to answer hypothetical questions of that sort,â he said. Pressed by Ms. Feinstein, Judge Kavanaugh refused to say whether he would rule that the Constitution permits a sitting president to be subpoenaed for testimony. He said that as a âmatter of judicial independence,â he would not give the Senate a âprecise answer on a hypothetical that might come before me.â 
            Sen. Feinstein: ""Can a sitting president be required to respond to a subpoena?"" Kavanaugh: ""As a matter of the canons of judicial independence, I can't give you an answer on that hypothetical question."" pic.twitter.com/cQhxUmxJH9  The potential for a legal fight over a presidential subpoena has become a hot topic amid speculation that Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel investigating Russiaâs interference in the 2016 campaign, may issue a subpoena for President Trump. Lawyers for the president and the office of the special counsel have been negotiating for months over whether Mr. Trump will voluntarily sit for an interview, so far without success. In 1974, the Supreme Court unanimously ruled in United States v. Nixon that a sitting president â in that case Richard M. Nixon â could be subpoenaed for documents and records like the Watergate tape recordings. But the court has never addressed the question of whether a sitting president could be forced to answer questions, which raises additional issues about the time it would take to prepare and the potential distraction from carrying out his constitutional duties. Noting that Chief Justice Warren Burger, who wrote the ruling, had been appointed by President Nixon, Judge Kavanaugh said he thought the Watergate tapes ruling was âone of the greatest momentsâ in the Supreme Courtâs history because it stood up for judicial independence in the face of political pressure, but how that precedent âwould apply to other hypotheticalsâ â like whether a subpoena for presidential testimony in a criminal investigation should also be upheld â was something he should not address, citing the practice of previous Supreme Court nominees. Judge Kavanaugh was a prosecutor working for Ken Starr when the independent counsel issued a subpoena to Mr. Clinton. But Mr. Clintonâs legal team negotiated a deal whereby he testified voluntarily before a grand jury, and Mr. Starr withdrew the subpoena, so the issue was never adjudicated. Years later, after working in the Bush administration after the Sept. 11 attacks, Judge Kavanaugh said that he thought presidents should be temporarily shielded from criminal investigation while they were in office, although he left it ambiguous as to whether he thought that was a change Congress should make or that the Constitution might already allow. Answering the very first question on Wednesday, from Senator Grassley, the Judiciary Committee chairman, Judge Kavanaugh said he would be an independent justice. He cited three Supreme Court landmarks to make his case. Advertisement Two were predictable: Brown v. Board of Education, the 1954 decision that ruled segregated public schools unconstitutional, and Youngstown Sheet and Tube Company v. Sawyer, the 1952 decision rejecting President Harry S. Trumanâs attempt to seize the nationâs steel mills to aid the war effort in Korea. The third was notable: United States v. Nixon, the 1974 decision in which Supreme Court unanimously ruled that President Nixon had to comply with a subpoena seeking tapes of his conversations in the Oval Office. Will a Supreme Court with two Trump-appointed justices overrule the right to an abortion? Itâs possible, but not the most likely outcome. Adam Liptak, The Timesâs Supreme Court reporter, explains. Judge Kavanaugh has not always been unequivocal in his support for the decision. In a 1999 transcript of a round-table discussion, he said, âMaybe Nixon was wrongly decided â heresy though it is to say so.â His allies have said he meant the statement as a critique of the legal strategy of President Bill Clintonâs lawyers. On Wednesday, Judge Kavanaughâs said the message of the decision, which he called one of the greatest moments in American judicial history, was clear. âNo one is above the law in our constitutional system,â he said. An abstract but important part of Judge Kavanaughâs judicial philosophy is his skeptical approach to so-called Chevron deference, the principle that when a statute granting a regulatory agency the authority to make rules about a certain topic â such as protections for the environment, consumers, or workers â are ambiguous, the courts should accept the agencyâs interpretation that it has the power to make a rule.

Corporations opposed to what they see as overly burdensome regulations want the Supreme Court to overturn or narrow the Chevron ruling, making it harder for executive agencies to expand into new areas. Questioned about his view of the powers of administrative agencies by Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, Judge Kavanaugh touted several rulings in which he had upheld environmental regulations rather than striking them down, but he gave little sign of support for Chevron deference, insisting instead that executive branch agencies must not be permitted to ârewriteâ laws passed by Congress to expand its authority. âIâve heard it said that Iâm a skeptic of regulation,â he said. âIâm not a skeptic of regulation at all. Iâm a skeptic of unauthorized regulation, of illegal regulation, of regulation that is outside the bounds of what the laws passed by Congress have said.â Back in 2006, Judge Kavanaugh testified during his appeals court confirmation that he was ânot involved in the questions about the rules governing detention of combatantsâ while working in a George W. Bush White House that was wrestling with the handling of terrorism suspects. Advertisement Instead, he said, his portfolio focused on âcivil justice issuesâ like terrorism insurance. Mr. Durbin was having none of it. It has since emerged that Judge Kavanaugh was involved in a Bush White House discussion about whether American citizens being held as enemy combatants should get access to lawyers, the senator said, and that the nominee had volunteered to prepare a Justice Department official for testimony about monitoring attorney-client conversations of terrorism-related federal inmates. He also said Judge Kavanaugh had privately admitted involvement in a December 2005 signing statement by President Bush that asserted a right to bypass a newly tightened torture ban. âYou went further than you should have,â Mr. Durbin said. âIn the three specific instances I gave you, you clearly were involved in questions about rules governing detention of combatants.â But Judge Kavanaugh defended his testimony as accurate. Among other things, he said his statement that he was ânot involvedâ â which came in response to a question 12 years ago from Mr. Durbin â was a reference to the Bush administrationâs so-called enhanced interrogation program, not terrorism prisoners generally. âI was not read into that program,â he said. âI told the truth about that.â He also said that while, as White House staff secretary in December 2005, he passed the torture ban signing statement onto Mr. Bush for his signature, it was the White House counsel â Harriet Miers â who controlled the text of that document. âI canât recall what I saidâ about the torture ban signing statement, Judge Kavanaugh said. âI do recall that there was a good deal of internal debate about that signing statement, as you can imagine there would be. I remember that it was controversial internally.â The second day of Judge Kavanaughâs hearings started with still more protests â just as Senator Grassley opened with a hope that the proceedings would be under more control than Tuesdayâs divisive opening. One woman was led out shouting âsham president, sham justice.â In his opening remarks, Mr. Grassley accused Democrats â who strategized for the hearing on a conference call Monday â of colluding with protesters to disrupt the hearing. âNBC News reported that Democratic members of the committee plotted with minority leaders to disrupt the hearing yesterday,â he said. âDemocratic senators interrupted the hearing 63 times before lunch, and in the audience, 70 people were arrested yesterday who were following their lead.â But one of the protesters took exception to Mr. Grassleyâs assertion, since, she said, she was calling out Democratic leaders such as Mr. Durbin for their tepid efforts to thwart the nominee. And a spokesman for Mr. Schumer said there was no coordination. Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh, President Trumpâs nominee to the Supreme Court, appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee for the first day of his confirmation hearing. In the 1990s, as a prosecutor in Mr. Starrâs Monica Lewinsky investigation, Judge Kavanaugh supported aggressive questioning of former President Bill Clinton about his sexual relations with the former White House intern. Advertisement Years later, however, Mr. Kavanaugh expressed regret about that view, suggesting that sitting presidents should not be subjected to the kind of distracting investigations that helped subject Mr. Clinton to as part of the Starr investigation. That shift in views has prompted Democrats to assert that Mr. Kavanaugh would try to protect Mr. Trump from Mr. Muellerâs Russia investigation. Ms. Feinstein pressed Judge Kavanaugh on that point on Wednesday. Mr. Kavanaugh said his views changed after he watched former President George W. Bush deal with the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and their aftermath, and concluded that presidents should not be distracted from important crises like that by having to respond to investigations such as the one that Mr. Clinton faced. âSeptember 11 â thatâs what changed,â he told Ms. Feinstein. He added, however, that his comments about potential changes to the statutes governing investigations of presidents do not reflect his thinking on the question of whether the Constitution would allow such investigations to proceed. âIf a case came up where someone was trying to say this was a constitutional principle, I would have a completely open mind on that,â he said. Critics of Judge Kavanaugh have noted that he clerked for a former 9th Circuit Court of Appeals judge, Alex Kozinski, who has been accused of sexually harassing more than a dozen women. They assert that Mr. Kavanaugh must have known about the allegations long before they were made public. Advertisement Senator Hatch came to Judge Kavanaughâs defense, calling such accusations against Mr. Kavanaugh âguilt by association,â but asked a series of gentle questions designed to give the judge an opportunity to deny them. He did just that, seeking to put distance between himself and any hint that he knew of or condoned the judgeâs behavior. âDid you know anything about these allegationsâ against Judge Kozinski? Mr. Hatch asked. âNothing,â Mr. Kavanaugh responded, adding a moment later: âWhen they became public, the first thought I had was no woman should be subjected to harassment in the workplace, including in the judiciary, especially in the judiciary.â He went on: âIt was a gut punch for me. It was a gut punch for the judiciary. I was shocked, disappointed, angry â swirl of emotions.â Ove rall, Judge Kavanaugh has gone out of his way to extol his record on women. He said he has made an aggressive effort to hire female clerks. Twenty-five of the 48 clerks that Judge Kavanaugh has hired during his 12 years on the appeals court have been women, and 21 have gone on to clerk at the Supreme Court, he told the committee. He said he was spurred to do so by an article in The New York Times by Linda Greenhouse, the newspaperâs former Supreme Court correspondent, who wrote in 2006, the same year Judge Kavanaugh joined the court, about the paucity of female clerks on the Supreme Court. Judge Kavanaugh said that troubled him, calling it âunacceptable.â He hired three women (out of four clerks) for his first year on the bench, adding that the next generation of leaders and Supreme Court justices will be drawn from the ranks of that generation. âItâs something Iâm very focused on at all times,â he said. Judge Kavanaugh held up his ruling in a 2012 appeals court case reversing the military commissions conviction of a former GuantÃ¡namo detainee, Salim Hamdan, as evidence that he would be independent and could resist public and political pressure when it came to deciding cases. Mr. Hamdan, a Yemeni man who served as a driver and bodyguard to the Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden had been convicted in 2008 before a military commission on a charge of providing material support for terrorism. His lawyers challenged the conviction on the grounds that material support was not a recognized international war crime at the time of his actions, and tribunals are generally for war crimes. The Military Commissions Act of 2006 listed that charge as a war crime that the tribunals could handle, but Judge Kavanaugh and the appeals court ruled that it did not apply retroactively and overturned the conviction. âYou will never have a nominee who has ruled for a more unpopular defendant than ruling for Salim Hamdan,â Judge Kavanaugh said. âAnd why did I do that in that case? Why did I rule for someone who had been involved in the September 11th? Itâs because the law compelled it.â Still, Mr. Hamdan, who had already served his sentence and been repatriated back to Yemen by 2012, was not accused of advance knowledge of or involvement in the September 11 attacks. And in many other important cases involving GuantÃ¡namo detainees, Judge Kavanaugh sided with the government â including ruling in ways that made it harder for detainees to win habeas corpus lawsuits challenging the basis for their indefinite wartime detention without trial; arguing that the appeals court had no jurisdiction to hear challenges brought by military commissions defendants before the tribunal issued a final judgment; and maintaining that international law cannot be enforced in court as a constraint against what Congress and the president do with tribunals.

The court order forces a witness to appear to give testimony.  In a second day of Senate hearings, Brett Kavanaugh said no-one was above the law but he would not be drawn on what he called a hypothetical question.  He also declined to say if he thought presidents could pardon themselves. The BBC's Gary O'Donoghue, in Washington, says the investigation into alleged collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia in the 2016 election has raised important constitutional questions about the extent to which an incumbent president can be forced to co-operate.  Democrats are keen to push Mr Kavanaugh on the issue, he adds. Mr Kavanaugh, 53, who faces a four-day confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, was also pressed on his approach to gun rights and the law around abortion. He said he understood the importance of the precedent in the landmark 1973 case, Roe v Wade, which legalised abortion nationwide, pointing out it had been reaffirmed by the Supreme Court several times. If confirmed, the conservative appeals court judge would be expected to tilt the court's balance to the right.  Chuck Grassley, the Republican chairman of the Judiciary Committee, asked Mr Kavanaugh whether he would have any trouble ruling against the president who nominated him, to which he responded: ""No-one is above the law in our constitutional system."" ""I think the first quality of a good judge in our constitutional system is independence,"" he added. Senior Democrat Dianne Feinstein asked if he thought a sitting president could be ""required to respond to a subpoena"". ""I can't give you an answer on that hypothetical question,"" Mr Kavanaugh said. He gave a similar answer to Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy who asked whether a president could issue a pardon to himself or to someone else in exchange for promising not to testify against the president. In a tweet in June, President Trump said he had ""the absolute right to PARDON myself"". On abortion, Mr Kavanaugh said he understood people's strong feelings and he described Roe v Wade as ""an important precedent of the Supreme Court that has been reaffirmed many times"". Supporters of abortion rights fear Mr Kavanaugh could provide the decisive fifth vote on the nine-seat court to overturn the 1973 ruling. On the issue of gun rights, Senator Feinstein pressed Mr Kavanaugh on his previous opposition to a ban on semi-automatic rifles. Such weapons have been used in a string of deadly high school shootings. ""Of course the violence in the schools is something we all detest and want to do something about,"" Mr Kavanaugh said, but added that handguns and other semi-automatic weapons were also used for hunting and self-defence. For a second day, protesters interrupted proceedings before being removed by security personnel. On Tuesday, there were angry scenes minutes after Mr Kavanaugh entered the committee rooms. The hearing was disrupted by angry shouts from members of the public and lawmakers alike. Texas Republican John Cornyn said it was ""the first confirmation hearing for a Supreme Court justice I've seen basically according to mob rule"". The US Capitol Police said 61 people were removed from the committee room on Tuesday and arrested for disorderly conduct. Republicans have a slim majority in the 100-seat upper house. They can confirm Mr Kavanaugh if they stay united. So far, there are no signs of Republican defections.

Wade Is ‘Settled Law,’ Susan Collins Says",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/21/us/politics/kavanaugh-collins-abortion.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/22/us/politics/22dc-kavanaugh/22dc-kavanaugh-facebookJumbo.jpg,"Advertisement Supported by By Sheryl Gay Stolberg WASHINGTON â Judge Brett M. Kavanaughâs views on abortion took center stage in the Senate on Tuesday after he assured a key Republican senator that he believed the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision was âsettled lawâ â a comment that Democrats and abortion rights advocates derided as a meaningless dodge. Emerging from a more than two-hour âcourtesy visitâ with Judge Kavanaugh, President Trumpâs Supreme Court nominee, Senator Susan Collins of Maine said they had discussed abortion cases âat length,â and that he told her he agreed with Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., who told senators during his 2005 confirmation hearings that he regarded Roe as âsettled law.â Ms. Collins later said she was heartened by the statement. Ms. Collins and Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska are two Republican backers of abortion rights, and both say they are undecided on Judge Kavanaugh. Their votes are critical to his confirmation. The term âsettled lawâ refers to a precedent that is entitled to respect, and does not necessarily indicate that precedent cannot be limited or overturned. Ms. Collinsâs statement on the matter may say less about Judge Kavanaughâs views on abortion than her ultimate vote, which appears to be leaning toward âyes.â She had already called him a âclearlyâ qualified nominee. The judgeâs confirmation hearings are set to begin on Sept. 4, with a confirmation vote possible before the end of next month. Democrats immediately pounced on the âsettled lawâ construction, saying it is a standard phrase employed to duck the real question: whether Roe was correctly decided. âLetâs be clear; this is not as simple as Judge Kavanaugh saying that Roe is settled law,â Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, told reporters. âEverything the Supreme Court decides is settled law until it unsettles it. Saying a case is settled law is not the same thing as saying a case was correctly decided.â Mr. Schumer, who has said he will oppose Judge Kavanaughâs confirmation, also met with him on Tuesday during an hour-and-a-half session that, by the senatorâs account, was cordial but not particularly revealing. Mr. Schumer said he asked numerous questions â including whether Judge Kavanaugh believed Roe was correctly decided, whether he believed the Affordable Care Act was constitutional and whether a president should have to comply with a subpoena â and that the judge repeatedly refused to answer. âCanât talk about a case that would come before me, canât talk about hypotheticals,â a frustrated-sounding Mr. Schumer said, relaying Judge Kavanaughâs words. âI said, âWell, then you canât talk about just about anything.ââ Judge Kavanaughâs views on abortion have raised intense concern among abortion rights advocates, in part because of a dissent he wrote in a 2017 case, Garza v. Hargan, that drew widespread attention last fall. Ms. Collins said she talked to Judge Kavanaugh âat lengthâ about the Garza case â the only abortion case in which he has rendered a decision. In that decision, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, on which Judge Kavanaugh serves, voted to allow an undocumented 17-year-old in immigration detention to seek an abortion without delay; the Trump administration had wanted to first transfer her to an adult sponsor for guidance. In his dissent, Judge Kavanaugh wrote that while the appeals court was bound to obey Supreme Court rulings that said the Constitution protects a womanâs right to choose an abortion, those precedents nonetheless permit the government to apply âreasonable regulations that do not impose an undue burden.â Ms. Collins has previously said that she will vote against any nominee who âdemonstrates hostilityâ to Roe. In her meeting with Judge Kavanaugh, Ms. Collins said, âwe talked at great length about precedent and the application of stare decisisâ â the legal principle of standing by precedent â âto abortion cases.â âWe talked about whether he considered Roe to be settled law; he said that he agreed with what Justice Roberts said at his nomination hearing, in which he said that it was settled law,â she added. Chief Justice Roberts testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee in 2005 that Roe was âsettled as a precedent of the court, entitled to respect under principles of stare decisis.â However, he added, those principles âexplain when cases should be revisited and when they should not.â Abortion rights groups immediately jumped on the âsettled lawâ comment, noting that, despite his confirmation hearing testimony, Chief Justice Roberts dissented when the Supreme Court struck down a Texas law that would have severely restricted access to abortion. âKavanaughâs reference to Chief Justice Roberts as a standard-bearer on abortion is alarming,â said Dawn Laguens, the executive vice president of Planned Parenthood Action Fund, the groupâs political arm. Beyond abortion, Ms. Collins said she and Judge Kavanaugh spoke about executive powers, his judicial philosophy and which judges he admires most. They also discussed gun rights, including the so-called Heller case, a highly publicized 2011 case involving a challenge to a District of Columbia law that required gun owners to register their weapons and banned possession of semiautomatic rifles. (The case was a follow-on to an earlier one, District of Columbia v. Heller, that resulted in a landmark Supreme Court ruling in 2008 that the Second Amendmentâs right to bear arms applied to individuals, not simply to those in a âwell-regulated militia.â) While the appeals court upheld those limits, Judge Kavanaugh dissented, arguing that while the government may ban fully automatic machine guns, a ban on semiautomatic rifles should be unconstitutional, because they âhave not traditionally been banned and are in common use by law-abiding citizens for self-defense in the home, hunting and other lawful uses.â Calling the session âvery productiveâ and âvery informative,â Ms. Collins said she intended to wait until after Judge Kavanaughâs confirmation hearings to decide whether to support him. âYou never know what questions are going to come up at a Judiciary Committee hearing where 21 individuals will be questioning him,â she said.

 Senators on the Judiciary Committee pressed Judge Brett Kavanaugh about the constitutional right to abortion and his views on the special counsel. â¢ The third day of confirmation hearings for the Supreme Court nominee Brett M. Kavanaugh, and the second day of senatorsâ questioning, began at 9:30 a.m. and stretched late into the night. â¢ The release of documents once marked âcommittee confidentialâ fortified Democratic questions on abortion, affirmative action and whether Judge Kavanaugh knew of Republican aidesâ theft of Democratic computer files. â¢ Many of those confidential documents spilled out in an anonymous release to The New York Times. Judge Kavanaughâs abortion views created a stir outside the hearing room. Adding to the concerns of abortion rights advocates was a Kavanaugh reference to contraceptives as âabortion-inducing drugs.â He was answering a question from Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, about his dissent in a case involving Priests for Life, a religious organization that objected to a regulation under the Affordable Care Act requiring many employers to provide free insurance coverage for contraception to their female workers. Advertisement The group had objected to an accommodation offered by the Obama administration that allowed it to obtain a waiver by completing a form. Advertisement âThey said filling out the form would make them complicit in the provision of the abortion inducing drugs that they were as a religious matter objecting to,â Judge Kavanaugh testified. Some religious organizations regard any form of birth control as an abortifacient. But Judge Kavanaughâs use of the term âabortion-inducing drugsâ set off alarm bells among abortion rights advocates and spawned a hashtag, #abortioninducingdrugs, on Twitter. Erica Sackin, director of political communications for Planned Parenthood of America, commented on Twitter: 
            BIG FLAG: #Kavanaugh just called birth control ""abortion-inducing drugs""         Judge Kavanaugh would not say whether he thought the Supreme Courtâs 2015 decision establishing a constitutional right to same-sex marriage had been correctly decided. But he tried to convey sympathy for gay rights by quoting from a Supreme Court decision in June that sided with a Colorado baker who refused to create a wedding cake for a same-sex couple. The ruling did not address the central dispute in the case and turned instead on apparent hostility against religion in a state civil rights commission. Judge Kavanaugh focused on one statement in the majority opinion, written by Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, the member of the court he hopes to replace. âOur society has come to the recognition that gay persons and gay couples cannot be treated as social outcasts or as inferior in dignity and worth,â Justice Kennedy wrote. Judge Kavanaugh noted that Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justices Samuel A. Alito Jr. and Neil M. Gorsuch, all members of the courtâs conservative wing, had joined the opinion. And he suggested that he agreed with the sentiment, too. Amid the arcane discussions of Supreme Court precedent and judicial philosophy, the Kavanaugh hearings did have some lighter moments. Advertisement Senator John Kennedy, Republican of Louisiana, had some probing questions about Judge Kavanaughâs past: âDid you ever get in trouble? Were you more of a John Boy Walton type or a Ferris Bueller type?â The judge didnât bite. Mr. Cruz asked Judge Kavanaugh if he intends to play basketball at the court inside the Supreme Court building. No sitting justice has played there, Mr. Cruz said, since Justice Clarence Thomas, âmany years ago, when he was a much younger justice.â Judge Kavanaugh said that if confirmed, he does indeed intend to play, on what is known as âthe highest court in the land.â And speaking of basketball, Judge Kavanaugh is exceedingly proud of the girlsâ basketball teams he has coached through the Catholic Youth Organization at his home parish, Blessed Sacrament in Chevy Chase, Md. About a dozen current and former players â in blue sweaters, ponytails and plaid skirts â showed up to watch. They sat in the front rows, right behind their coach. Judge Kavanaugh introduced each of them, rattling off their names and, in a remarkable display of memory not devoted to legal precedent, their grades. âLetâs see,â he said. âWeâve got Liza going into fifth grade. Keeganâs in fifth. Annaâs in seventh. Shawnee is in seventh. Quinn is in sixth. Sophie is in seventh. So I think I got it all right.â The room broke out into applause. In documents obtained by The New York Times that date back to Judge Kavanaughâs time in the George W. Bush administration, Mr. Kavanaugh, then a White House aide, seemed to raise doubts about whether Roe v. Wade, the landmark Supreme Court ruling that found a constitutional right to an abortion, was âsettled law.â He was considering a draft opinion piece to be run under the names of anti-abortion women that stated, âit is widely accepted by legal scholars across the board that Roe v. Wade and its progeny are the settled law of the land.â Responding to the email, the future Supreme Court nominee wrote, âI am not sure that all legal scholars refer to Roe as the settled law of the land at the Supreme Court level since Court can always overrule its precedent, and three current Justices on the Court would do so.â Advertisement The documents do not indicate how Judge Kavanaugh would rule, but they are fodder for Democratic questioning. Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, asked Mr. Kavanaugh about the document, noting it had been made public. Mr. Kavanaugh defended the statement he made in the email, and said âthe broader point was simply that it was overstating something about legal scholars.â âIâm always concerned about accuracy, and I thought it was not an accurate description of all legal scholars,â he said, adding later that Roe v. Wade is âan important precedent. It has been reaffirmed many times.â He declined to comment directly on Ms. Feinsteinâs questions as to whether it is âcorrect law.â NARAL Pro-Choice America, the abortion rights lobby, jumped on the release immediately: âBrett Kavanaughâs emails are rock solid evidence that he has been hiding his true beliefs and if he is given a lifetime seat on the Supreme Court, he will gut Roe v. Wade, criminalize abortion, and punish women. Everything he said yesterday in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee about âsettled lawâ was nothing but a show to mislead the Senate.â [Read more about the documents, here.] A tantalizing moment on Wednesday came when Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, asked Judge Kavanaugh whether he had meetings with Manuel Miranda, a former Senate Republican aide who was caught stealing files from the computers of Senate Judiciary Committee Democrats, including Mr. Leahy. Judge Kavanaugh denied ever knowingly receiving stolen material when he was a White House aide tasked with getting President George W. Bushâs judicial nominees confirmed. On Thursday, questioning Judge Kavanaugh a second time, Mr. Leahy described and put up on posters several emails about his interactions with Mr. Miranda, indicating that he had received permission from the committee chairman around 3 a.m. to disclose them. They included a March 2003 email from Mr. Miranda to Judge Kavanaugh that included several pages of Democratic talking points, marked ânot for distribution,â and another to Judge Kavanaugh from a Republican Senate staff member whose subject line âspyingâ and which referred to âa mole for us on the left.â 
            Subject: spying pic.twitter.com/GuIGHCjwiE  Judge Kavanaugh reiterated that he had no knowledge that Mr. Miranda had infiltrated Democratic files, saying he likely assumed that the Republican staff was getting information from friends who were Democratic staff members and nothing had raised red flags at the time. Advertisement âI was born at night but not last night,â Mr. Leahy said. âIf I had something that somebody said, we have stolen this or donât tell anybody we have this, I think it would raise some red flags.â Mr. Leahy also pressed him about more than 100,000 documents from his period as a Bush White House lawyer that the Senate has not been permitted to see, even on a confidential basis, because a lawyer for President Bush has said they are subject to executive privilege. Mr. Leahy asked whether Judge Kavanaugh could confirm that none of those contain more such emails from Mr. Miranda.  Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address.

View all New York Times newsletters. âSenator, I am not involved in the documents process,â Judge Kavanaugh. âI donât know whatâs in them.â Replied Mr. Leahy: âThat is convenient.â Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, pressed Mr. Kavanaugh on comments he made in support of Justice Antonin Scaliaâs dissent in a case that upheld the constitutionality of an independent counsel. âGiven your views on Morrison v. Olson, we are obviously worried you will feel bound by this dissent by Scalia if President Trump decides to attempt to fire the special counsel Bob Mueller,â Mr. Durbin said. Mr. Kavanaugh began by pushing back on the framing of Mr. Durbinâs question, noting that case involved the creation of an independent counsel, not a special counsel. But ultimately, he assured the senator, âIâve made clear in my writing that when a court order requires a president to do something or prohibits a president from doing something under the constitution or laws of the United States, that is the final word.â When it comes to the scope of executive power, he said, âI am one not afraid at all in my record of twelve years to invalidate executive power when it violates the law.â Later, under questioning from Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware, Judge Kavanaugh pushed back against what he called a misinterpretation of a comment he made at a 1999 round table, when he said, âMaybe Nixon was wrongly decided â heresy though it is to say so.â He was referring to the 1974 case of United States v. Nixon, where the Supreme Courtâs ruled unanimously that a sitting president, Richard M. Nixon, could be subpoenaed for documents and records like the Watergate tape recordings. Judge Kavanaugh said he was being wry, and critiquing the strategy of lawyers for President Bill Clinton during the investigation of that president. âThe tone of voice there has made the printed word look much different than how it was intended,â he said, adding that he believes the case was correctly decided, and is âone of the four greatest decisionsâ in Supreme Court history. (He did not say what the other three are.) Advertisement Much of the morning was given to what appeared to be real drama, the move by Senator Cory Booker, Democrat of New Jersey, to release âcommittee confidentialâ documents without Republican permission â and Republican threats to exact consequences. After all, such a release could result in Mr. Bookerâs expulsion from Senate. âBring it,â the senator said. Senators Booker and Mazie K. Hirono, Democrat of Hawaii, went ahead and released the documents. âThis is about the closest Iâll ever come in my life to an âI am Spartacusâ moment,â Mr. Booker declared. But after the drama subsided, Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said all of those documents were cleared for release overnight. William A. Burck, the former Bush White House lawyer tasked with reviewing the Kavanaugh documents, said in a statement, âWe cleared the documents last night shortly after Senator Bookerâs staff asked us to. We were surprised to learn about Senator Bookerâs histrionics this morning because we had already told him he could use the documents publicly. In fact, we have said yes to every request made by the Senate Democrats to make documents public.â The question remains, so why were Republicans handing Mr. Booker his moment, not saying, hey, whatâs the big deal? As for Mr. Booker, his spokeswoman gave him credit for forcing the documentsâ release â and said this would not be the last of the document kerfuffles. âCory and Senate Democrats were able to shame the committee into agreeing to make last nightâs documents publicly available, and Cory publicly released those documents as well as other committee confidential documents today,â the spokeswoman, Kristin Lynch, said in a statement. âAnd heâll keep releasing them because Republicans are hiding Brett Kavanaughâs record from the American people.â Advertisement Late in Wednesdayâs proceedings, the questioning finally reached Senator Kamala Harris, Democrat of California, and she launched into tense questioning that centered around whether Judge Kavanaugh had ever discussed the Russia investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, with a lawyer or lawyers from the law firm of President Trumpâs longtime personal lawyer, Marc Kasowitz. 
            Has Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh had a conversation about Robert Mueller or his investigation with anyone at Trump's personal attorney's law firm?We donât know. He refused to answer my question. pic.twitter.com/PAKxDGvEtZ  Judge Kavanaugh appeared somewhat baffled, but he would not offer a blanket ânoâ because he said he didnât know the names of every lawyer who worked for the firm, and he had discussed the Mueller investigation with lawyers and judges. âI think youâre thinking of someone, and you donât want to tell us,â Ms. Harris said without elaboration. Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, gave Judge Kavanaugh an opportunity on Thursday to revisit Ms. Harrisâs line of questioning. Mr. Kavanaugh responded by acknowledging he doesnât know everyone who works at the firm, but said, âI donât recall any conversations of that kind.â âI havenât had any inappropriate conversations about that investigation with anyone,â Judge Kavanaugh said. âIâve never given anyone any winks, hints, forecasts, previews, nothing, about my view as a judge, or how I would rule as a judge on that or anything related to that.â A spokesman for Kasowitz Benson Torres said in a statement Thursday that âthere have been no discussions regarding Robert Muellerâs investigation between Judge Kavanaugh and anyone at our firm.â In a letter last June to Mr. Mueller, Mr. Kasowitz cited a majority opinion by Judge Kavanaugh, without naming him, saying, âThe President may decline to prosecute certain violators of federal law just as the President may pardon certain violators of federal law. The President may decline to prosecute or may pardon because of the Presidentâs own constitutional concerns about a law or because of policy objections to the law, among other reasons.â The question is, can and will the senator tell the public what she knows? Most Supreme Court nominees express enthusiasm for cameras in the court at their confirmation hearings, only to change their minds after they join the court. Judge Kavanaugh took a different approach, saying only that âI will have an open mind on it.â Advertisement He said his current court, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, has recently allowed live audio coverage of its arguments. That development, he said, was a positive one. But he offered only vague comments on electronic coverage of the Supreme Court. The court generally releases audio recording of arguments at the end of the week and does not allow camera coverage. Judge Kavanaugh made one novel suggestion, offering that the court should consider camera coverage of the sessions in which the justices summarize their opinions from the bench. The court, which currently releases audio of those sessions months later, is unlikely to adopt the idea. The justices may be wary of suggesting to the public that their informal oral summaries, rather than their written opinions, precisely set out the details of decisions.

Hereâs the sign-up.) Good evening. Hereâs the latest. 1. It was the first day of confirmation hearings for Judge Brett Kavanaughâs appointment to the Supreme Court, and it started with a bang. Senate Democrats moved angrily to adjourn to consider tens of thousands of pages of documents released the night before the hearing. They were joined by crowds of protesters, who cried out their support. President Trumpâs potential legal troubles were a recurring theme, but Republicans praised Judge Kavanaugh and expressed confidence he will be confirmed. The hearings continue through the week. _____ 2. Voters in Massachusetts went to the polls today and elected Ayanna Pressley, 44, above, over 10-term Representative Michael Capuano in a Democratic primary that few said she could win. She is now poised to become the first African-American in the state to be elected to the House of Representatives. Separately, the White House and President Trump are rattled by a forthcoming book that portrays the administration as an out-of-control operation: âcrazytown,â in the reported words of the chief of staff, John Kelly. According to the book, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said âthe president acted like â and had the understanding of â a âfifth or sixth grader.ââ Thatâs among the most explosive claims in âFear,â by Bob Woodward, due out next week. The Times obtained a copy. _____ 3. Even after news that Colin Kaepernick had signed a multimillion-dollar deal with Nike and become a face of its âJust Do Itâ campaign, his silence is deafening. The former quarterback started kneeling in protest during the national anthem before N.F.L. games in 2016, and other players soon joined him. Their protest caused a huge outcry, dividing fans and the league owners, captivating celebrities and athletes and motivating President Trump to persistently tweet his anger over it. But Mr. Kaepernick is letting his social media savvy â and a total rejection of interviews â spin the message. _____ 4. $1,000,000,000,000. Amazon became the second American company to reach a market value of $1 trillion. Apple hit that milestone last month, but with Amazon, our reporter writes, the path has been much more complicated. Amazon has revolutionized how people shop â and taught retailers some hard lessons along the way. But thereâs also been a rise in its brick-and-mortar operations. _____ 5. Other tech giants are under scrutiny over the coming midterm elections. Executives from Facebook, Twitter and Google will testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Wednesday about their preparations to thwart foreign influence campaigns and disinformation. Sheryl Sandberg, Facebookâs C.O.O., above. The power their platforms wield over public discourse is enormous. Temporarily barring Alex Jones of Infowars â who regularly spreads lies, conspiracy theories and inflammatory attacks against political enemies â drastically reduced his reach. Over the summer, Facebook announced the discovery of hundreds of fake pages and user accounts on its site. Can you tell the difference between a genuine Facebook post and one that was part of an influence campaign? Try your hand with our quiz. _____ 6. Another worry for Facebook: In Libya, it has become a platform for âkeyboard warriorsâ who stoke violence. In the capital, where violence has broken out between rival militias in recent days, some combatants picked up rocket launchers. Others headed online. âKeyboard warriors,â as Facebook partisans are known in Libya, issued boasts, taunts and chilling threats online as their counterparts attacked from the ground. Some Facebook users even provided direct coordinates for targeted attacks. Facebook insists it is policing its Libyan platform, but illegal activity is rife. _____ 7. A replacement for John McCain: John Kyl, a former Arizona senator, will fill the seat, though he has committed to serving only until the start of the next Congress, in January. Mr. Kyl has been helping Judge Brett Kavanaugh through the confirmation process. In tapping him to fill it, Gov. Doug Ducey has effectively put the stature of Mr. McCainâs seat ahead of the political imperative of keeping it in Republican hands, our reporter writes. And in Chicago, Mayor Rahm Emanuel, above, announced he would not seek re-election. âThis has been the job of a lifetime, but it is not a job for a lifetime,â he said. _____ 8. Tropical Storm Gordon is heading for the Gulf Coast and is poised to become the first hurricane to strike the continental United States this year. Itâs expected to intensify into a Category 1 hurricane before it makes landfall along the Gulf Coast late Tuesday or early Wednesday. Forecasters donât anticipate the kind of damage that Hurricane Harvey caused a year ago, but the governors of Alabama, Louisiana and Mississippi have all declared states of emergency. Weâll have live updates about the storm. _____ 9. News from the U.S. Open: Sloane Stephens, the defending champion, lost in the U.S. Open quarterfinals to Anastasija Sevastova, above, on Tuesday. Karolina Pliskova will take on Serena Williams this evening. Check back for live updates and results. And in case you missed it, Roger Federer lost last night to John Millman. He blamed the heat.

Kavanaugh, President Trumpâs Supreme Court nominee, urged prosecutors investigating President Bill Clinton to question him in graphic detail about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky, a White House intern, according to a memorandum released on Monday by the National Archives. Mr. Kavanaugh spent more than three years working for Ken Starr, the independent counsel who investigated a series of scandals during Mr. Clintonâs presidency, and he worked on the report that led the House of Representatives to impeach Mr. Clinton. Mr. Kavanaugh drew up the memo as other members of Mr. Starrâs team were preparing to question Mr. Clinton. The memo, dated Aug. 15, 1998, was shot through with disgust for Mr. Clintonâs behavior and seemed animated by the deep animosity that had developed between the White House and Mr. Starrâs team. The document betrayed deep hostility to Mr. Clinton, and it included 10 proposed questions about matters like oral sex and masturbation. Former members of Mr. Starrâs team have said that Mr. Kavanaugh, who is now a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, immediately regretted its tone. [Read the memo here.] But in the memo, he was unrelenting. âThe president has disgraced his office, the legal system and the American people by having sex with a 22-year-old intern and turning her life into a shambles â callous and disgusting behavior that has somehow gotten lost in the shuffle,â Mr. Kavanaugh wrote. âHe has committed perjury (at least) in the Jones case,â Mr. Kavanaugh wrote, referring to the sexual harassment case brought by Paula Jones, an Arkansas state worker who said Mr. Clinton had made lewd advances toward her in a hotel room when he was governor. âHe has lied to his aides,â Mr. Kavanaugh wrote. âHe has lied to the American people. He has tried to disgrace youâ â meaning Mr. Starr â âand this office with a sustained propaganda campaign that would make Nixon blush.â âIt may not be our job to impose sanctions on him, but it is our job to make his pattern of revolting behavior clear â piece by painful piece,â Mr. Kavanaugh wrote. âArenât we failing to fulfill our duty to the American people if we willingly âconspireâ with the president in an effort to conceal the true nature of his acts?â To that end, Mr. Kavanaugh wrote, Mr. Clinton should be asked extremely detailed questions unless he first either resigned or admitted to perjury and publicly apologized to Mr. Starr. Mr. Kavanaugh listed 10 possible questions based on Ms. Lewinskyâs testimony, saying that he would âleave the best phrasing to others.â Among them were these: âIf Monica Lewinsky says that you had phone sex with her on approximately 15 occasions, would she be lying?â âIf Monica Lewinsky says that you ejaculated into her mouth on two occasions in the Oval Office area, would she be lying?â âIf Monica Lewinsky says that you masturbated into a trash can in your secretaryâs office, would she be lying?â The substance of the memo has long been available, notably in a 2010 book, âThe Death of American Virtue: Clinton vs. Starr,â by Ken Gormley. But the full memo had not been made public until Monday, and it provided striking details about the hard line Mr. Kavanaugh urged his colleagues to take. In an interview this month, Robert J. Bittman, the deputy counsel who led the Lewinsky prosecution for Mr. Starr, said Mr. Kavanaugh had recognized that the memo was a misstep. âBrett immediately regretted the tone of that memo,â Mr. Bittman said. âMy memory is that he was sleep deprived and then quickly realized in retrospect that it was over the top.â Mr. Kavanaugh took a different approach when Mr. Starr was about to provide Congress with a report laying out possible grounds for impeachment, urging his colleagues to use discretion in describing Mr. Clintonâs interactions with Ms. Lewinsky. He lost that fight. The final report included all of the sexual details, and it was quickly made available on the internet. In the memo, Mr. Kavanaugh said he was âmindful of the need to respect the office of the president.â âBut in my view,â he continued, âgiven what we know, the interests of the office of the president would best be served by gathering the full facts regarding the actions of this president so that the Congress can decide whether the interests of the presidency would best be served by having a new president.â The memo was released as tensions between Mr. Trump and Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel investigating links between Mr. Trump and Russia, seem to be rising with each passing day. Judge Kavanaugh seems certain to be questioned about the memo and what it suggests about the Mueller investigation at his confirmation hearings next month. Judge Kavanaugh is likely to say that his views on the wisdom of criminal investigations of sitting presidents have evolved considerably in the two decades since he wrote the memo. âI believe that the president should be excused from some of the burdens of ordinary citizenship while serving in office,â he wrote in 2009 in the Minnesota Law Review, after an extended stint in the George W. Bush White House and after he became a judge. Among those burdens, Judge Kavanaugh wrote, were responding to civil lawsuits and criminal charges. He said Congress should consider imposing limits on such proceedings. âEven the lesser burdens of a criminal investigation â including preparing for questioning by criminal investigators â are time-consuming and distracting,â Judge Kavanaugh wrote. âLike civil suits, criminal investigations take the presidentâs focus away from his or her responsibilities to the people. And a president who is concerned about an ongoing criminal investigation is almost inevitably going to do a worse job as president.â Judge Kavanaugh said that the proceedings could resume after a president left office and that impeachment remained an option before then. His years of service as staff secretary to Mr. Bush had altered his understanding of the all-consuming nature of the presidency, he wrote in 2009, at the start of the Obama administration. The investigation of Mr. Clinton, he wrote, had been misguided. âLike many Americans at that time, I believed that the president should be required to shoulder the same obligations that we all carry,â he wrote. âBut in retrospect, that seems a mistake. âLooking back to the late 1990s, for example,â Judge Kavanaugh wrote, âthe nation certainly would have been better off if President Clinton could have focused on Osama bin Laden without being distracted by the Paula Jones sexual harassment case and its criminal investigation offshoots.â At the time, though, Mr. Kavanaugh took a hard line, aghast that Mr. Clinton had lied and tarnished the presidency â âall to cover up his oral sex from an intern.â Michael D.

Hereâs the sign-up.) Good morning. Hereâs what you need to know: â¢ The leak of previously secret documents on Thursday injected fresh intrigue into the confirmation hearings of President Trumpâs Supreme Court nominee, as Democrats pressed the judge to explain his comments on abortion rights and affirmative action. In one email from 2003, he appeared to challenge whether Roe v. Wade was the âsettled law of the land.â On Thursday, Judge Kavanaugh said that the comment reflected âan accurate description of all legal scholars.â Republicans, who continue to support his appointment to the Supreme Court, discarded the revelations as insignificant. Hereâs an overview of Judge Kavanaughâs record on civil rights, and a recap of what happened on Thursday. Our politics team will have coverage when the hearings resume at 9:30 a.m. Eastern. â¢ The confirmation process has been like a campaign audition for Democrats eyeing a 2020 presidential run. â¢ One by one, top officials lined up on Thursday to say they had nothing to do with the unsigned essay in The Times that was sharply critical of President Trump. The White House started a furious mole hunt. The public played an obsessive guessing game. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, directed her Twitter followers to call the main switchboard of The Times to ask who wrote the piece.

And we explain the 25th Amendment, a mechanism to declare a president unfit for office that the essay said had been considered. â¢ Mr. Trump sought to regain control of the political conversation at a rally Thursday night in Montana, where he looked at home in front of a jubilant audience. â¢ With Roman Catholics clamoring for more transparency, attorneys general are aggressively investigating possible sexual abuse by clergy members. On Thursday alone, all eight Catholic dioceses in New York were issued subpoenas, and the New Jersey attorney general announced an inquiry. âI was deeply troubled to read the allegations contained in last monthâs Pennsylvania grand jury report,â the attorney general said in a statement. âWe owe it to the people of New Jersey to find out whether the same thing happened here.â â¢ Attorneys general in Illinois, Missouri, Nebraska and New Mexico have also said they will look into their local institutions. â¢ With one hairy-chested centerfold for Cosmopolitan in 1972, the heartthrob actor broke taboos and changed cultural understandings of the female gaze. Mr. Reynolds, who delighted audiences for four decades, died on Thursday at 82. To many in Hollywood, he was an enigma, both strong-willed and tormented by self-doubt. âI think Iâm the only movie star whoâs a movie star in spite of his pictures, not because of them; Iâve had some real turkeys,â he told The Times in 1978. â¢ That steamy centerfold?

Kavanaugh had not even begun Thursday morning when Senator Cory Booker, Democrat of New Jersey, threatened to release secret emails â even if it meant being expelled from the Senate. âThis is about the closest Iâll ever come in my life to an âI am Spartacusâ moment,â the senator declared with a flourish. It was a made-for-television moment â albeit later mocked by Republicans as grandstanding â and for Mr. Booker, it might come in handy. He is one of three Democrats on the Judiciary Committee â the others are Senators Kamala D. Harris of California and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota â said to be contemplating presidential runs in 2020, and there is no time like a stately, nationally televised Supreme Court nomination hearing to grab the attention of the news media and amass valuable footage for future campaign commercials. Other 2020 hopefuls, notably Senators Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, have been making their own moves this week. Ms. Gillibrand, who has positioned herself as a leading advocate for womenâs rights, has been appearing with womenâs groups to protest the nomination, calling it âa clear threat to rights that women all across America hold dear.â And Ms. Warren, notoriously press shy in the corridors of the Capitol, told Politico on Wednesday that she intended to âopen upâ and start giving hallway interviews. But for Ms. Harris and Mr. Booker â and to a lesser extent, Ms. Klobuchar, who is less given to high drama â the hearings have been something like a campaign audition, not to mention the criticism that goes along with it. âRunning for president is no excuse for violating the rules of the Senate or of confidentiality of the documents that we are privy to,â Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, snapped after Mr. Booker made his threat about the emails. (It turned out that Mr. Booker had permission to make those messages public after all, prompting another Republican, Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina, to quip, âYou didnât have to be Spartacus.â) It did not take long â just 13 words into the start of the first day of the hearings â for Ms. Harris to make her mark. The chairman of the Judiciary Committee had just gaveled hearings to order and was about to utter his 14th word when the California senator interrupted, demanding a delay to give the panel time to review a last-minute document dump. âWe cannot possibly move forward,â she protested, as the chairman, Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, promptly ruled her out of order. Throughout the hearings, Ms. Harris, once the California attorney general, drew on her formidable skills as a former prosecutor to repeatedly skewer Judge Kavanaugh and back him into unpleasant corners. âCan you think of any laws that give the government the power to make decisions about the male body?â she asked at one point, in an exchange that picked up considerable traction on social media. The judge seemed flustered. âIâm not â Iâm not â thinking of any right now, senator,â he replied. Mr. Booker, for his part, proved his skills at oratory; on Wednesday night, he talked for 23 of the 30 minutes he was allotted to question Judge Kavanaugh, delivering a soaring lecture on racial inequality â even as he repeatedly cut off the nominee while grilling him about his views on affirmative action, racial profiling and voter identification laws. âIt seems that you are O.K. with using race to single out some Americans for extra security measures because they look different, but youâre not O.K. with using race to help promote diversity,â Mr. Booker said at one point, while disclosing that the committee had a confidential email titled âracial profilingâ relating to Judge Kavanaugh. For Mr. Booker and Ms. Harris, both darlings of the progressive movement, the hearings are also a chance to demonstrate fidelity to the left. Progressives have become increasingly frustrated with the way Senate Democrats are handling Judge Kavanaughâs nomination; on Wednesday, more than a dozen groups sent a scathing letter to Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, accusing him of allowing moderate Democrats to go their own way in considering whether to vote for confirmation. âAnything less than 49 Democratic votes against Kavanaugh would be a massive failure of your leadership,â read the letter, organized by Credo Action, which bills itself as a social-change network. Republicans, on the other hand, are accusing the Democrats of playing politics with one of the most sacred duties of the Senate: the responsibility to advise and consent on a Supreme Court nomination. Mr. Booker came under withering criticism on Wednesday when he sent a letter to supporters asking for signatures opposing Judge Kavanaugh. The letter, which circulated on Twitter, asked recipients to click through to a website that offered tickets to a coming New Jersey Democratic State Committee event. Then, on Thursday, Ms. Harris sent out her own fund-raising email, spotlighting her does-the-government-have-the-power-to-regulate-the-male-body exchange with Judge Kavanaugh. âI know youâre standing with me in this fight, and I appreciate everything youâve done so far,â the missive said, above a bright red link that declared, in all caps, Contribute. Republicans sneered. As Mr. Cornyn, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate, wrote on Twitter, âIt is all about the 2020 Democrat presidential primary.â   video Advertisement",0.06,0.883,0.057,0.7351,0.4423047785547784

 The Latest: Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh has concluded his opening statement. The committee will resume his confirmation hearings at 9:30 a.m. Wednesday. Hereâs the latest. â¢ Democrats turned the opening into a brawl, but Republicans pushed through. Opening statements in the hearing were delayed by more than an hour as Democratic senators complained about the limits on their access to documents from Judge Kavanaughâs tenure in the Bush administration White House and pressed to adjourn. With protesters shouting and being removed from the room, Democrats sought a vote to postpone the hearing but were denied it. The frequent interruptions led one Republican, Senator John Cornyn of Texas, to call the opening of the hearing âmob rule.â But the committee chairman, Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, refused to delay the hearingâs opening day and got through it by about 5 p.m. [Democrats sought to portray Judge Kavanaugh as a hopeless partisan.] â¢ Trumpâs potential legal troubles were a recurring theme. Many Democrats brought up statements by Judge Kavanaugh suggesting that he would be sympathetic to a sitting president who challenged a subpoena for testimony or an indictment. They suggested that President Trump may have picked him from the ranks of conservative jurists because he was hoping for an ally on the court, should Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel investigating the Trump campaignâs ties to Russia, move against the president. Advertisement â¢ Republicans praised Kavanaugh and expressed confidence he will be confirmed. Republicans used their opening statements to praise Judge Kavanaugh as highly qualified and a good man. They accused Democrats of hypocrisy and argued that his 12 years of appeals court rulings, which are public, are the best way to evaluate what kind of Supreme Court justice he would be. And, secure in the knowledge that they control the Senate and can confirmed the judge with a simple majority vote, Republicans expressed confidence that however unruly things get, the Senate will ultimately approve his appointment. Advertisement â¢ The hearing foreshadowed likely Democratic frustration in coming days.  Democrats signaled in their opening statements that they intend to press Judge Kavanaugh to explain in detail what he thinks about contentious legal questions, especially whether the Roe v. Wade abortion rights decision was rightly decided â an issue that could illuminate whether he views it as settled precedent or vulnerable to overturning. But Republicans like Mr. Grassley said it would be inappropriate for him to indicate how he might rule on anything that might come before the court in the future. In his prepared opening statement, Judge Kavanaugh laid the groundwork for disclaiming that he will bring any ideological lens to interpreting ambiguous constitutional text, invoking the ideal of a judge as an âumpire â a neutral and impartial arbiter who favors no litigant or policy.â The hearing is scheduled to resume at 9:30 a.m. on Wednesday, starting with questioning by Mr. Grassley and by Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the ranking Democrat. Each senator on the committee will have 30 minutes in the first round of questioning and 20 in a second round, which is expected to wrap up on Thursday. Judge Kavanaugh would then be excused, and the senators will question a panel of legal experts who support and oppose his confirmation. Canât get enough? The rest of our dispatches from the day are below.  One of the biggest points of tension in the Kavanaugh confirmation hearings will be Judge Kavanaughâs response to Democratsâ questions about whether he believes certain cases â notably Roe v. Wade, the 1973 landmark decision establishing a constitutional right to abortion â have been correctly decided. In his opening statement, Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the Judiciary Committee chairman, laid the groundwork for Judge Kavanaugh to refuse to answer, by invoking what has come to be known as the âGinsburg rule,â after Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who was appointed by a Democratic president, Bill Clinton. [Read Judge Kavanaughâs opening statement.] Declaring that it would be âunfair and unethicalâ for the judge to answer questions about specific cases, Mr. Grassley said: âItâs my advice to him to follow the example set by Judge Ginsburg,â adding that âa nominee should offer no hints, no forecasts, no views.â Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the committeeâs ranking Democrat, said a dissent from Judge Kavanaugh opened a window on his views on abortion, one she said indicated that he would not support the constitutional right to abortion established in 1973 in Roe v. Wade. Last year, Judge Kavanaugh said that allowing an undocumented teenager in federal custody to obtain an abortion was âbased on a constitutional principle as novel as it is wrong: a new right for unlawful immigrant minors in U.S. government detention to obtain immediate abortion on demand.â He said he would have given the government more time to find a sponsor for the teenager. Advertisement But Judge Kavanaugh did not join a separate dissent from Judge Karen LeCraft Henderson, who wrote that the teenager had no right to an abortion because she was not a citizen and had entered the country unlawfully. Will a Supreme Court with two Trump-appointed justices overrule the right to an abortion? Itâs possible, but not the most likely outcome. Adam Liptak, The Timesâs Supreme Court reporter, explains. Ms. Feinstein is one of the most ardent supporters of gun restrictions in the Senate, and in her opening statement she forecast that she intended to grill Judge Kavanaugh about what she regarded as his âout of the mainstreamâ views on gun rights. Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh, President Trumpâs nominee to the Supreme Court, appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee for the first day of his confirmation hearing. She was referring to a dissent Judge Kavanaugh wrote in a case challenging a District of Columbia law that required gun owners to register their weapons, and banned possession of semiautomatic rifles. The appeals court upheld the limits as constitutionally permissible under the Second Amendment. But in his dissent, Judge Kavanaugh argued that a ban on semiautomatic rifles should be unconstitutional because they âhave not traditionally been banned and are in common use by law-abiding citizens for self-defense in the home, hunting and other lawful uses.â For the senator, the issue of gun violence is personal. She became mayor of San Francisco more than 40 years ago when Mayor George Moscone and Harvey Milk, an openly gay politician, were shot and killed. In her opening statement, she noted that President Trump had promised that whomever he nominated to the Supreme Court would be âanti-choice and pro-gun,â adding, âWe believe what he said.â Fred Guttenberg, the father of Jaime Guttenberg, a 14-year-old girl killed in the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Parkland, Florida, took to Twitter on Tuesday to say that Mr. Kavanaugh had rebuffed him when he went to introduce himself. 
            Just walked up to Judge Kavanaugh as morning session ended. Put out my hand to introduce myself as Jaime Guttenberg's dad. He pulled his hand back, turned his back to me and walked away. I guess he did not want to deal with the reality of gun violence.         In a video of the hearing, Mr. Guttenberg can be seen approaching the judge as the hearing was breaking for lunch and extending his hand to Judge Kavanaugh. Though it wasnât clear whether Judge Kavanaugh first saw him, the nominee did turn back and look at Mr. Guttenburg, who took a step closer and appeared to say something to him. Judge Kavanaugh then turned and walked away.

Advertisement Before joining the federal appeals court here, Judge Kavanaugh had a long history of Republican political activism. He worked on the team, led by Ken Starr, which investigated former President Bill Clinton. He was in Florida during the presidential recount of 2000, advising then-Gov. George W. Bush. (He also once represented Mr. Bushâs brother Jeb.) Later, he joined the Bush White House. The judge has been involved âof the most pitched and partisan battles of our lifetimes,â Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware, said. Addressing Judge Kavanaugh directly, he added that it is âcritical that this committee and the American people fully examine your record to understand what kind of justice you would be.â Senator Durbin, meanwhile, has called Judge Kavanaugh the âForrest Gump of Republican politicsâ â a phrase he reprised on Tuesday, adding, âYou always show up in the picture.â The hits kept coming: âJudge Kavanaugh has been knee deep in partisan politics,â Senator Mazie K. Hirono, Democrat of Hawaii, said. The first day of the confirmation hearings for Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh, President Trumpâs nominee to the Supreme Court, started with Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee pushing to adjourn and protesters being removed. Of course, President Trump also had to weigh in. 
            ....looking to inflict pain and embarrassment to one of the most highly renowned jurists to ever appear before Congress. So sad to see!         Senator Patrick Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, said that Judge Kavanaughâs still-hidden White House records could be particularly illuminating on a question of pressing urgency: understanding his views on the scope of executive power â and, in particular, whether sitting presidents should be immune from legal process, like subpoenas to testify in a criminal investigation â while they are in office. Judge Kavanaugh came up in Washington conservative legal circles as a prosecutor working for Kenneth W. Starrâs independent counsel investigation into President Bill Clinton. But later, in a speech he made at a law school after serving in President George W. Bushâs White House and then becoming a judge, he said that the distraction of preparing for questions by criminal investigators would make a president do a worse job, so presidents should be excused from that burden until after they leave office. Advertisement His remarks were ambiguous: he said Congress should consider enacting a statute granting presidents temporary immunity while in office, which could suggest that the Constitution does not grant presidents that authority on its own. Still, he clearly indicated that he sympathizes with the idea that being subjected to legal process burdens a presidentâs ability to carry out his constitutional responsibilities. And the Supreme Court has never decided whether a president can be forced to testify in response to a subpoena â something that it may address if Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel investigating President Trumpâs campaign ties to Russia, were to subpoena him. Against that backdrop, Mr. Leahy said that Judge Kavanaughâs âexpansive view of executive power and executive immunityâ may have intrigued Mr. Trump, while also noting that the president over the weekend attacked Attorney General Jeff Sessions for permitting the Justice Department to indict two Republican congressmen ahead of the midterm election. âYouâve taken the unorthodox position that presidents should not be burdened with a criminal or civil investigation while in office. Now we have a president who has declared in the last 24 hours that the Department of Justice shouldnât prosecute Republicans,â Mr. Leahy said. âNow, itâs â itâs Alice in Wonderland. And I find it difficult to imagine that your views on this subject escape the attention of President Trump, who seems increasingly fixated on his own ballooning legal jeopardy.â Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, picked up that line of attack, focusing on what he said were convenient inconsistencies in Judge Kavanaughâs views on whether sitting presidents can be questioned in criminal investigations. As a lawyer working for Mr. Starr, Judge Kavanaugh urged his superiors to question Mr. Clinton in graphic detail. After serving as Mr. Bushâs staff secretary, though, Judge Kavanaughâs views evolved. âI believe that the president should be excused from some of the burdens of ordinary citizenship while serving in office,â he wrote in 2009 in the Minnesota Law Review. Among those burdens, Judge Kavanaugh wrote, were responding to civil lawsuits and criminal charges. Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, can always be counted on to criticize Mr. Trump, and on Tuesday he did not disappoint. Mr. Flake began his opening statement by praising Judge Kavanaugh as a good family man and a fine athlete â the judge runs marathons. But then he pivoted to express serious concerns over how Judge Kavanaugh will deal with a president who does not seem to respect the institutions of government or the rule of law.

After reading aloud Mr. Trumpâs weekend tweet attacking Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Mr. Flake said, âThat is why a lot of people are concerned about this administration and why they want to ensure that our institutions hold.â But while he pledged to question Judge Kavanaugh closely on his view of executive power, Mr. Flake is widely expected to be a yes vote when it comes to the judgeâs confirmation. Advertisement Judge Kavanaughâs nomination has been controversial at his alma mater, Yale Law School, Senator Ben Sasse, Republican of Nebraska, noted. Many hundreds of current and former law students there signed an open letter chastising the law schoolâs administration for issuing a news release noting his nomination and gathering positive comments from faculty members. 
                President Trump is moving quickly to appoint federal judges. So far, his efforts have strengthened conservative majorities rather than changed the balance of most courts.             âJudge Kavanaughâs nomination,â the letter said, âpresents an emergency â for democratic life, for our safety and freedom, for the future of our country.â The law schoolâs news release concerning Judge Kavanaugh was similar to earlier ones issued after other alumni were nominated to high positions, including Justice Sonia Sotomayor and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. A second open letter, also signed by hundreds of current and former students, wrote that Judge Kavanaugh âhas been a valuable friend to the Yale communityâ and was âeminently qualified to serve as a Supreme Court justice.â The moment Judge Kavanaughâs confirmation hearing opened, Democrats and protesters turned it into a verbal brawl. Senator Kamala Harris, Democrat of California, immediately interrupted the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Charles E. Grassley, demanding a delay to consider tens of thousands of pages of documents released Monday â the night before the hearing and a holiday. Other Democrats backed her, especially the senators considering a run for the White House in 2020, as did womenâs rights protesters, several of whom were arrested and thrown out as they decried the sessions as a sham. âWe cannot possibly move forward, Mr. Chairman, with this hearing,â one of the presidential aspirants, Senator Harris, declared. Advertisement Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut called the hearing âa charade and a mockery.â âWhat are we trying to hide? Why are we rushing?â asked Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont. As the Democrats spoke, activists were dragged, shouting, one by one out of the hearing room. âWe dissent! Vote no! Vote no!â one cried. [Read more about how the G.O.P. under Trump is carrying out a sweeping transformation of the federal judiciary.] Mr. Grassley argued that the committee has received âmore materials on Judge Kavanaugh than we have had on any Supreme Court nominee in history.â He said Republican aides have already reviewed the 42,000 documents that arrived Monday night. âThatâs no reason to delay the hearing.â Democrats quieted down â temporarily â and the hearing appeared to be getting underway with Judge Kavanaugh introducing his family â including his wife, his parents, an aunt and uncle and cousins. But as soon as he finished, Democrats renewed their request to delay the hearing. The fight over records concerning Judge Kavanaugh came as no surprise to Senate Republicans. Some of them, including Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader, feared in July â when President Trump was choosing among the finalists â that Judge Kavanaughâs enormous paper trail could stall his nomination Confirmation hearings for Supreme Court nominees didnât always exist. But the 19th Amendment, school desegregation and television all contributed to major changes in the process. New York Times reporters Maggie Haberman and Jonathan Martin wrote at the time that Mr. McConnell made clear in multiple phone calls with Mr. Trump and the White House counsel, Donald F. McGahn II, that Judge Kavanaughâs paper trail would pose difficulties for his confirmation. Advertisement Because the number of pages ran into the millions, Mr. McConnell said they could hand Senate Democrats an opportunity to delay the confirmation vote until after the new session of the Supreme Court began in October. Democrats focused intensely on the amount of information they say is being withheld from them about Judge Kavanaughâs work in the White House under President George W. Bush. 
            Itâs unprecedented for the Senate Judiciary Committee to be considering a nominee for the highest court in the land without reviewing documents from 35 months of his public service in the White House. #WhatAreTheyHiding pic.twitter.com/eE7ThqLUZH  Thousands of pages of records have not yet been made public, and on Friday the Trump administration asserted executive privilege and refused to release more than 100,000 pages of records about Judge Kavanaughâs time in the Bush White House. An additional 42,000 pages of documents were released the night before the hearing, according to Senator Chuck Schumer, the minority leader, who raised complaints about the timing. 
             The Senate was just given an additional 42,000 pages of Kavanaugh documents the NIGHT BEFORE his confirmation hearing. This underscores just how absurd this process is. Not a single senator will be able to review these records before tomorrow.         A press officer for the committee, responding via the committeeâs Twitter account a few hours later, said the majority staff had âcompleted its review of each and every one of these pages.â About a dozen women, dressed in red robes and white bonnets in the fashion of âThe Handmaidâs Tale,â stood silently, as if in prayer, outside the hearing room. In the atrium of the Hart Senate Office Building, just off the hearing room, over 250 activists from womenâs rights groups held a vigil in protest, sharing stories underscoring the importance of reproductive rights. They were joined by Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, the New York Democrat, who gave brief remarks, and gave a thunderous cheer when Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, joined them and took pictures with enthralled fans. Inside the chamber, protesters were arrested one by one, leaving once-coveted seats in the hearing room empty. 
            After the arrests at the Kavanaugh Hearing there are plenty of seats open in the hearing room: pic.twitter.com/LV0LC14HEf  The Womenâs March took credit for the protests, and said more than 30 women have been arrested so far. (So have a few men.) Advertisement âWomen are disrupting this hearing today because our lives are at risk,â Rachel OâLeary Carmona, chief operating officer of the Womenâs March, said in an emailed statement. âWomen will die if Kavanaugh is confirmed.â One protester, referencing the withholding of records relating to Judge Kavanaugh, offered what was perhaps the dayâs most unusual shout: âI had to have a background check to work in a laundromat!â For Democrats on the committee with possible presidential aspirations â including Senators Cory Booker of New Jersey, Harris and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota â the televised hearings offer an opportunity for combative questioning that can fuel both viral clips and material for a 2020 campaign. It is unclear how much Senator Feinstein will attempt to direct the questioning from members of her own party. As the Senateâs most ardent proponent of gun restrictions, she is expected to grill Judge Kavanaugh on a 2009 dissent in which he argued against banning semiautomatic weapons. Ms. Feinstein, who was the chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee when it conducted an investigation into the Bush administrationâs torture program after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, may also pursue her own line of questioning over Judge Kavanaughâs time as an associate White House counsel â especially his offer to help a senior administration official prepare testimony about the governmentâs surveillance of conversations between certain terrorism suspects and their lawyers. That offer, revealed in a trove of documents released ahead of the confirmation hearing, contradicts Judge Kavanaughâs 2006 testimony, in which he told lawmakers he was ânot involved in the questions about the rules governing detention of combatants.â Democrats have charged that the statement, made in a White House email, was a lie, although it is unknown if Judge Kavanaugh actually provided assistance.

But she wonât be the last. By Michelle Goldberg Opinion Columnist Shortly after his inauguration, Donald Trump, uniquely attentive to his debt to the religious right, appointed the anti-abortion activist E. Scott Lloyd to head the Office of Refugee Resettlement, despite Lloydâs lack of relevant experience. The position gave Lloyd authority over unaccompanied minors caught crossing into the United States, authority Lloyd exploited to try to stop pregnant migrants from getting abortions. Last year, thanks to Lloydâs interference, a 17-year-old from Central America had to wage a legal battle to end her pregnancy. Known in court filings as Jane Doe, the girl learned she was pregnant while in custody in Texas, and was adamant that she wanted an abortion. In keeping with Texasâs parental consent law, she obtained a judgeâs permission, helped by a legal organization called Janeâs Due Process. Janeâs Due Process raised money for the abortion, which was scheduled for the end of her first trimester. But under Lloydâs direction, the shelter where she was being detained refused to cooperate. Doe went back to court, and a federal judge ruled in her favor, issuing a temporary restraining order against the government. The administration appealed, and the case, Garza v. Hargan, went to a three-judge panel of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. One of the judges was Brett Kavanaugh. Garza v. Hargan was the only major abortion-rights case Kavanaugh ever ruled on. His handling of it offers a clue about whatâs in store for American women if heâs confirmed to the Supreme Court. No one knows whether Kavanaugh would vote to overturn Roe v. Wade outright or simply gut it. But even on a lower court, Kavanaugh put arbitrary obstacles in the way of someone desperate to end her pregnancy. Thanks to Trump, he may soon be in a position to do the same to millions of others. Itâs fitting that last weekâs Kavanaugh confirmation hearings were regularly interrupted by the sound of women screaming. Again and again, protesters, most of them female, cried out for the preservation of their rights, and were arrested. Republican men were contemptuous. âWhatâs the hysteria coming from?â asked Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska. Let me answer. It is true, as Sasse said, that protesters have claimed for many years that if Roe v. Wade is overturned, women will die. Itâs a fair prediction; women died before Roe, and where abortion is illegal, unsafe abortion leads to maternal death. In the past, however, Roe has been saved. Should Kavanaugh be confirmed, it will either fall or be eviscerated.  In Garza, Kavanaugh and another judge vacated the temporary restraining order that prevented the government from hindering Doeâs abortion. Brigitte Amiri, an A.C.L.U. lawyer who represented the girl, was stunned, because it seemed clear that Doe, whoâd already obtained the necessary judicial signoff, had the law on her side. âIt wasnât what I was expecting from any judge that would have read Roe v. Wade,â Amiri said of the ruling. âConservatives, progressives, anyone.â Indeed, a few days later, the full court reversed the panelâs decision. Kavanaugh, dissenting, wrote that âthe government has permissible interests in favoring fetal life.â By the time Jane Doe got her abortion, she was 15 weeks pregnant and needed a more complicated second-trimester procedure. On Friday, Rochelle Garza, a lawyer who served as Doeâs temporary legal guardian during the proceedings, testified at Kavanaughâs confirmation hearings. âShe was one of the most vulnerable people in our community,â Garza said of the girl, adding, âShe was an immigrant, she didnât speak English, she was in detention, and she was being put under extreme pressure. And I felt it was unfortunate that Judge Kavanaugh did not take that into consideration.â We shouldnât expect a Trump nominee, however personally decent his friends say he is, to care about womenâs wishes. Kavanaughâs defenders insist that heâs the sort of judge any Republican would appoint, and they are correct. Still, itâs a particularly bitter insult that women stand to lose reproductive autonomy thanks to the minority presidential victory of a louche misogynist.  Politicians sometimes say that they are personally opposed to abortion, but believe it should be legal. Trump and some of his enablers reverse that formulation. The president, who does not, according to two of his lovers, wear condoms, has declined to say whether heâs ever been involved with an abortion. According to court papers unsealed on Friday, Elliott Broidy, former deputy finance chairman of the Republican National Committee, also refused to wear condoms during sex with his mistress, Shera Bechard, then demanded she get an abortion when she became pregnant. According to the unsealed papers, Broidy admired Trumpâs âuncanny ability to sexually abuse woman and get away with it.â A famous pro-choice poster from the 1980s proclaimed, âYour body is a battleground.â Kavanaugh is likely to join the Supreme Court because in 2016, the woman whom most women voted for was defeated. Now our bodies are subject to occupation. Michelle Goldberg has been an Opinion columnist since 2017. She is the author of several books about politics, religion and women’s rights, and was part of a team that won a Pulitzer Prize for public service in 2018 for reporting on workplace sexual harassment issues.  @michelleinbklyn  Advertisement",0.079,0.846,0.074,-0.6311,0.44367750305250303

Hereâs the sign-up.) Good morning. Hereâs what you need to know: â¢ Itâs the question almost everyone in Washington (and beyond) wants answered. President Trump erupted in anger on Wednesday after The Times published a stinging Opinion piece by an unidentified senior official saying that a âquiet resistanceâ in the administration was working to thwart the presidentâs âworst inclinations.â The article, which said the presidentâs problems were rooted in âamorality,â raised questions about his capacity to govern. Read the Op-Ed here. Mr. Trump denounced the essay, calling it âgutless,â and the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, issued a statement about its author saying, âThis coward should do the right thing and resign.â Washington has been scrambling to identify the anonymous official. This morning, Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo denied writing the piece. â¢ The Opinion pages of The Times are managed separately from the newsroom. The Op-Ed editor, James Dao, said the material was important enough to merit anonymity, which the department rarely grants. â¢ As a White House lawyer in the George W. Bush administration, Judge Brett Kavanaugh raised doubts about whether Roe v. Wade, the landmark Supreme Court ruling that found a constitutional right to an abortion, was âsettled law,â according to an email made available to The Times. He also called an affirmative action regulation âa naked racial set-aside.â The email, written in March 2003, is one of thousands of documents that were turned over to the Senate Judiciary Committee before confirmation hearings for Judge Kavanaugh, President Trumpâs Supreme Court nominee, but that were not made public or available for discussion by Democrats. The document was among several provided to The Times late Wednesday. The news is likely to take center stage today, the third day of Judge Kavanaughâs confirmation hearings. Follow here for live updates. â¢ Testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee  on Wednesday, the Supreme Court nominee dodged questions about presidential powers to thwart the Russia investigation and obstruction of justice.

But he and Ms. Sandberg largely avoided taking sides in highly political debates.  â¢ Britain has charged two Russian intelligence officers with attempted murder after the poisoning in March of a former Russian spy and his daughter in England.

Kavanaugh on Friday of misleading the Judiciary Committee, saying he dissembled in testimony about crucial issues ranging from his views on abortion rights to his involvement in several Bush-era controversies. But Republicans expressed confidence that none of the punches Democrats had thrown at the Supreme Court nominee had landed with sufficient force to jeopardize his confirmation. Four days of Supreme Court confirmation hearings ended on Friday the way they began, with sharply partisan charges and tension remarkable for normally staid proceedings. In two of the strongest statements on Friday, Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the top Democrat on the committee, said on Twitter that Judge Kavanaugh gave answers that âwere not trueâ when asked whether he had used âmaterials stolenâ from committee Democrats when he was a White House lawyer under President George W. Bush. Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, also using Twitter, accused the judge of lying. âWhat else is he lying about?â Mr. Wyden wrote. âHis views on overturning #RoevWade? Whether he was involved in Bush-era torture programs? Whether he believes Trump can pardon himself?â Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, raised the volume on Saturday morning. But Raj Shah, a White House spokesman, dismissed the complaints by Democrats and liberals, while attacking those who made public some of Judge Kavanaughâs White House emails that were provided to the Judiciary Committee but marked âconfidential,â meaning they were not to be disclosed. âWe should put these Democratic senators under oath, because they are the ones deliberately misleading the public,â Mr. Shah said. âTheyâve violated Senate rules, leaked confidential information and trafficked in conspiracy theories â all in a desperate attempt to smear Judge Kavanaughâs stellar reputation. The good news for the country is that it has been a resounding failure.â Mr. Shahâs final point may prove true. Senate Democratic staff members, preparing for the next phase of the fight, circulated a draft document on Friday titled âJudge Kavanaugh Misled the Judiciary in 2004 and 2006 and Has Done So Once Again.â But with no Republican senator signaling any concern, and with the party holding 51 votes in the Senate, Judge Kavanaughâs confirmation appeared likely, even as questions linger over documents that remain hidden from the public. âI expect that over the next months, even years, all of the relevant documents will eventually become public and we may well end up having a much clearer record in a number of the incidents that were debated very fiercely,â said Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware. âAnd at that point,â he added, âJudge Kavanaugh will most likely be serving as a justice of the Supreme Court.â Here are some of the issues that arose during the hearing, and how Judge Kavanaugh addressed them: Mr. Leahy pushed Judge Kavanaugh on his testimony, during his 2004 and 2006 appeals court confirmation hearings, that he neither knew nor suspected that a Republican Senate aide with whom he had interacted, Manuel Miranda, had infiltrated the computer files of Judiciary Committee Democrats about which of Mr. Bushâs appeals court nominees Democrats would try to block and with what tactics. Mr. Leahy cited numerous emails that Mr. Miranda had sent Judge Kavanaugh and a few other officials during that period, including verbatim internal Democratic talking points, a draft Democratic letter that was not yet public, âintelâ about what questions Mr. Leahy was planning to ask a nominee at a coming hearing, and an email chain about meeting at Mr. Mirandaâs apartment to obtain âuseful infoâ about two other Democratic senators. But Judge Kavanaugh testified that none of the information he received had raised a âred flag,â suggesting that he had assumed the Republican Senate aides were instead receiving information from friends on the Democratic staff. Separately, Mr. Miranda told The New York Times that he never informed Judge Kavanaugh about the computer server. âI am not satisfied with the answers, certainly on the stolen Manny Miranda material,â Mr. Leahy said on Friday. âI think itâs fair to say that he was not forthright with me and Iâm bothered by it.â A Democratic lawyer who saw some of her work copied by Mr. Miranda concluded on Slate.com on Friday that Judge Kavanaugh not only should not be confirmed but also should perhaps âbe impeached.â As an appeals court nominee, Judge Kavanaugh distanced himself from significant involvement with two other Bush appeals court nominees who attracted controversy, Charles W. Pickering Sr. and William H. Pryor Jr. While he acknowledged in writing that he had âparticipated in discussions and meetings concerning all of the presidentâs judicial nominationsâ as a member of a judicial selection committee, he told senators that Judge Pryor âwas not one that I worked on personallyâ and Judge Pickering âwas not one of the judicial nominees that I was primarily handling.â Still, emails showed he did do some work on both nominations. Among other things, Judge Kavanaugh was invited to participate in a conference call about Judge Pryorâs pending confirmation hearing in an email that went to a âPryor Working Group,â and he performed a variety of tasks on the Pickering nomination, like meeting with Senate aides about him and handling a draft opinion article that supported Mr. Pickering. A colleague identified him as one of two White House lawyers who had been âmuch more involved in the Pickering fight.â In August, after Democrats suggested that Judge Kavanaugh had misled the Senate about his involvement in the Pickering nomination, his defenders said he was not the White House official assigned to âprimarilyâ handle that one. Asked at the hearing about the Pryor nomination, Mr. Kavanaugh gave a similar answer. Judge Kavanaugh also faced scrutiny from Mr. Leahy over his statement to Mr. Leahy in his 2006 confirmation hearing that he had first learned about the Bush administrationâs warrantless surveillance program from a December 2005 news article. Mr. Leahy had been asking what he had seen in his role as staff secretary from 2003 to 2006. Yet a Sept. 17, 2001, email showed that Judge Kavanaugh â then a White House lawyer, not staff secretary â asked John Yoo, a Justice Department lawyer, whether there were âany results yetâ on the Fourth Amendment implications of warrantless surveillance for counterterrorism purposes. Later that day, Mr. Yoo completed a memo on a âhypotheticalâ warrantless wiretapping program that evolved into a more extensive memo that Mr. Yoo signed on Oct. 4, 2001, the day the program secretly started. Insisting that his testimony had been â100 percent accurate,â Judge Kavanaugh said that in the early days after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, White House lawyers worked on many things related to national security, but he had never been âread intoâ the existence of the surveillance program. Mr. Yoo corroborated that account. Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, grilled Judge Kavanaugh about his testimony over his involvement in Bush administration policy for the handling of captured terrorism suspects. As an appeals court nominee, Judge Kavanaugh turned aside questions about torture by saying that he was ânot involved in the questions about the rules governing detention of combatantsâ and portrayed his portfolio as focusing on âcivil justice issuesâ like terrorism insurance. It later emerged that when the Bush administration was internally debating whether American citizens being held as âenemy combatantsâ should have access to lawyers, Judge Kavanaugh had advised that the Supreme Court justice Anthony M. Kennedy would probably rule that they had a right to them. An email also showed that in September 2001, he volunteered to prepare a senior Bush administration official to testify about the governmentâs monitoring of conversations between federal terrorism inmates and their lawyers. But Judge Kavanaugh said that âmy testimony then was accurate and was the truth.â He said he had understood Mr. Durbinâs question in 2006 to be about the Bush administrationâs âenhanced interrogation program,â which he was not involved in. As for the signing statement about the torture ban, he said his role as staff secretary was to hand papers to the president that had been prepared by others. On Wednesday, Judge Kavanaugh told Ms. Feinstein that he considered the 1972 abortion rights ruling, Roe v. Wade, to be a âsettled as a precedent of the Supreme Court entitled the respect under principlesâ of a legal doctrine that justices should not lightly reopen already decided issues. But a 2003 White House email by Judge Kavanaugh â which emerged into public view on Thursday morning â showed that he had objected to a line in a draft opinion article stating that âit is widely accepted by legal scholars across the board that Roe v. Wade and its progeny are the settled law of the land.â He proposed deleting that line, writing: âI am not sure that all legal scholars refer to Roe as the settled law of the land at the Supreme Court level since court can always overrule its precedent, and three current justices on the court would do so.â Although his email stopped short of saying what he personally believed, Democrats and abortion rights advocates portrayed that as a contradiction that suggested he was being evasive and did not believe Roe was settled. But Judge Kavanaugh told Ms. Feinstein on Thursday that he had only meant that the line inaccurately overstated the position âof legal scholarsâ and reiterated that Roe was a precedent that had been reaffirmed repeatedly.

Itâs shocking but no longer surprising. By David Leonhardt Opinion Columnist First, the revelations about the Trump White House in Bob Woodwardâs forthcoming book are shocking. Many White House officials do not respect the president, and theyâre quite happy to leak damaging anecdotes about him. For anyone who spent time in Washington during the Bush and Obama years â when both presidents were largely revered by their staffs â itâs a jarring change.  But it is no longer surprising. Itâs been abundantly clear for a long time that President Trump is unfit for the office â and that the people who work for him somehow manage both to disdain him and to continue protecting him at the expense of the country. For more, read The Washington Postâs summary of the book and Jonathan Chaitâs commentary about it for New York magazine.  The Supreme Court. The raucous opening day of Judge Brett Kavanaughâs confirmation hearing wasnât, for the most part, about him. It was about the Republican Partyâs hardball, rule-changing tactics in transforming the federal courts.  âDemocrats are driving home that Republicans keep changing the rules,â Voxâs Tara Golshan wrote. In particular, Democrats yesterday were blasting the last-minute release â without time for scrutiny â of tens of thousands of documents related to Kavanaughâs time as a White House aide during George W. Bushâs presidency.  âThis is not the debate Republicans wanted to have,â James Wallner, a former Republican Senate staff member, tweeted yesterday morning. âNote: Kavanaugh hasnât been debated once. Itâs just the process, the documents. Democrats have framed this debate 100%.â A little history is useful here. Both parties, without question, have played a role in making the courts more partisan and overtly political. As Republicans like to emphasize, the Democrats were the ones who first rejected a nominee based strictly on ideology: Robert Bork, in 1987. In Borkâs place, President Ronald Reagan ultimately nominated the more moderate Anthony Kennedy, whose retirement in turn led to Kavanaughâs nomination. But itâs also the case that Republicans have done much more than Democrats to politicize the courts. How so? One, they have rejected a significantly higher percentage of Democratic nominees since 1981 than Democrats have rejected Republican nominees, according to data collected by the legal scholar Russell Wheeler. This high rejection rate eventually led Senate Democrats during the Obama years to eliminate the filibuster for federal appeals court judges. (That move has recently received criticism, because Republicans later did the same for Supreme Court nominees, but I still think Democrats had no better alternative, given Republican obstruction.) Two, Republicans have nominated more politically extreme judges than Democrats have, as research by Lee Epstein of Washington University and others has shown. Jason Zengerleâs recent Times Magazine piece and the accompanying episode of The Daily podcast have more details. Three, Republicans stole a Supreme Court seat by refusing to let President Barack Obama fill a vacancy in 2016. There was no precedent for such a move, and it was vastly more radical than anything Democrats have done. The seat effectively decided many of the courtâs biggest cases last year, and it will shape the court for decades. As Iâve written before, I expect the Senate to confirm Kavanaugh. Republicans have the votes to do so, and theyâve shown no signs of splintering. If Iâm right about that, this weekâs hearings are more about framing the debate over the future of the courts than anything else.  And Democrats are absolutely right to use the occasion to explain how radical Senate Republicans â and, by extension, large parts of the federal judiciary â have become.  Finally, Congressional districts change over the years. But the closest thing to todayâs Seventh Congressional District in Massachusetts was previously represented by John F. Kennedy, Tip OâNeill and Joe Kennedy II.  Starting in January, it will almost certainly be represented by Ayanna Pressley, who beat the incumbent handily in the Democratic primary last night. She would be the first African-American ever to represent Massachusetts in the House.  You can join me on Twitter (@DLeonhardt) and Facebook. You can subscribe to this newsletter here.

Kavanaugh during his confirmation hearing on Tuesday before the Senate Judiciary Committee.,2018-09-05T00:47:00Z,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,Democrats Open Contentious Hearings With Attack on ‘Partisan’ Kavanaugh,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/04/us/politics/kavanaugh-confirmation-supreme-court.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/05/us/politics/05dc-kavanaugh-sub/05dc-kavanaugh-sub-facebookJumbo.jpg,"Advertisement Supported by By Sheryl Gay Stolberg and Adam Liptak WASHINGTON â Senate Democrats tore into President Trumpâs Supreme Court nominee on Tuesday, painting Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh as a narrow-minded partisan as the opening day of his confirmation hearings verged on pandemonium. Dozens of screaming protesters were hauled out of the hearing room in handcuffs. The verbal brawl began moments after the hearings began. Democrats, furious at being denied access to records related to Judge Kavanaugh, immediately interrupted the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, demanding time to consider tens of thousands of pages of documents released late Monday â the night before the hearing. Judge Kavanaugh, who finally had the microphone hours later, portrayed himself as an impartial jurist and affable family man. âI am not a pro-plaintiff or pro-defendant judge,â Judge Kavanaugh told the committee. âIâm not a pro-prosecution or pro-defense judge. I am a pro-law judge.â But the hearings were dominated by Democratic theatrics and crackling protests. For more than an hour at the outset, irate Democrats and a frustrated Mr. Grassley parried back and forth. Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, denounced the hearing as âa charade and a mockeryâ and repeatedly moved to adjourn, while Mr. Grassley ruled him out of order over and over again. At one point, Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, accused Democrats of engaging in âmob rule.â Protesters, most of them women, shouted down senators; by dayâs end, Capitol Police said a total of 70 people had been arrested, including nine outside the room. It was a chaotic start to what would ordinarily be a staid, albeit deeply consequential, process. And barring an astounding revelation, the path remains clear for Judge Kavanaughâs ultimate confirmation â probably this month. If he is confirmed, he could shape American jurisprudence for decades to come, replacing the retired Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, a critical swing vote on divisive matters like same-sex marriage and abortion, with an unabashed conservative. The session, which mostly settled down by the afternoon, also gave Americans their first extended glimpse of Judge Kavanaugh, 53, who brought his family â his wife and two daughters, his parents, an aunt and uncle and some cousins â along with him. He talked about going to ball games with his father and coaching his daughter in basketball, drawing bipartisan smiles when he gave a shoutout to each member of the team. But that was about the extent of the comity; just days after members of the Senate had gathered together in a bipartisan show of civility at the funeral of Senator John McCain, the crowded hearing room in the Hart Senate Office Building seethed with antipathy. Some of it reflected lingering bitterness over the treatment of Judge Merrick B. Garland, whose nomination to the Supreme Court in 2016 by President Barack Obama was not even considered by Senate Republicans. In his opening statement, Judge Kavanaugh made a point of praising his colleagues on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit â and one in particular. âI have served with 17 other judges, each of them a colleague and a friend, on a court now led by our superb chief judge, Merrick Garland,â Judge Kavanaugh said While Republicans cited Judge Kavanaughâs impressive rÃ©sumÃ© â Yale Law degree, Supreme Court clerkship â as a reason to confirm him, Democrats made clear that they are laying the groundwork to turn the nomineeâs biography against him. Before joining the federal appeals court, Judge Kavanaugh had a long history of Republican political activism. He worked on the team, led by Ken Starr, that investigated former President Bill Clinton. He was in Florida during the presidential recount of 2000, advising George W. Bush, the governor at the time. (He also once represented Mr. Bushâs brother Jeb.) Later, he joined the Bush White House. âJudge Kavanaugh has been knee deep in partisan politics,â said Senator Mazie K. Hirono, Democrat of Hawaii. Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware, said the nominee had been involved in some of âof the most pitched and partisan battles of our lifetimes.â Addressing Judge Kavanaugh directly, Mr. Coons added that it was âcritical that this committee and the American people fully examine your record to understand what kind of justice you would be.â Democrats have been complaining for weeks that the document production process, supervised by a lawyer for former President Bush, is rigged. Only a portion of documents relating to Judge Kavanaughâs time in the White House Counselâs Office have been made available to the committee â and many of those are being kept from the public. And the committee has received no documents from Judge Kavanaughâs time as staff secretary to Mr. Bush, a role that he has said was âthe most interesting and informative for me,â as preparations for his work as a judge. Republicans countered that Democrats were harping on access to documents because they could not quibble with Judge Kavanaughâs qualifications. And they took digs at their Democratic colleagues on the judiciary panel, several of whom â Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Cory Booker of New Jersey and Kamala D. Harris of California â are weighing presidential runs. âThis is not about documents,â said Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas. âItâs not about qualification. Itâs not about record. What it is about is politics. It is about Democratic senators trying to re-litigate the 2016 election, and, just as importantly, working to begin litigating the 2020 presidential election.â Senator Patrick Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, said that Judge Kavanaughâs still-hidden White House records could be particularly illuminating on a question of pressing urgency: understanding his views on the scope of executive power â in particular, whether sitting presidents should be immune from the legal process, like subpoenas to testify in a criminal investigation. As a lawyer working for Mr. Starr, Judge Kavanaugh urged his superiors to question Mr. Clinton in graphic detail. But his views on the topic have evolved considerably since then. In a speech he made at a law school after serving in the Bush White House and then becoming a judge, he said that the distraction of preparing for questions by criminal investigators would make a president do a worse job, so presidents should be excused from that burden until after they leave office. Democrats insinuated that Mr. Trump nominated Judge Kavanaugh because he believed the judge would protect him from the investigation being conducted by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel. âYouâve taken the unorthodox position that presidents should not be burdened with a criminal or civil investigation while in office,â Mr. Leahy said. âNow we have a president who has declared in the last 24 hours that the Department of Justice shouldnât prosecute Republicans,â Mr. Leahy said. âNow, itâs â itâs Alice in Wonderland. And I find it difficult to imagine that your views on this subject escape the attention of President Trump, who seems increasingly fixated on his own ballooning legal jeopardy.â Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, picked up that line of attack, focusing on what he said were convenient inconsistencies in Judge Kavanaughâs views on whether sitting presidents could be questioned in criminal investigations. âThis is a president whoâs shown us consistently that heâs contemptuous of the rule of law,â Mr. Durbin said. âItâs that president whoâs decided you are his man.â âSo are people nervous about this?â Mr. Durbin continued. âAre they concerned about it? Of course they are.â Many of those who are nervous were seated in the audience, including Linda Sarsour, a founder of the Womenâs March, who was one of the first in line to attend the hearing â and one of the first to be arrested. Also in the room was Fred Guttenberg, the father of Jaime Guttenberg, a 14-year-old girl killed in the school shooting in Parkland, Fla., who created a buzz on Twitter after Judge Kavanaugh appeared to rebuff his effort to shake the nomineeâs hand. Tuesdayâs hearings consisted of only opening statements. When questioning begins on Wednesday, Judge Kavanaugh is sure to face a detailed examination of his views on abortion. Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, expressed concern that Judge Kavanaugh would vote to overturn Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that established a constitutional right to abortion. She cited a dissent last year in which Judge Kavanaugh said he would have delayed an abortion sought by an undocumented teenager in government custody. Judge Kavanaugh said that allowing an undocumented teenager in federal custody to obtain an abortion was âbased on a constitutional principle as novel as it is wrong: a new right for unlawful immigrant minors in U.S. government detention to obtain immediate abortion on demand.â He said he would have given the government more time to find a sponsor for the teenager. In his opening statement, Judge Kavanaugh said he would model himself on Justice Kennedy, for whom he once served as a law clerk. In the process, Judge Kavanaugh sought to assure the committee that he would be âa neutral and impartial arbiter who favors no litigant or policy.â âAs Justice Kennedy showed us, a judge must be independent, not swayed by public pressure,â Judge Kavanaugh said. âOur independent judiciary is the crown jewel of our constitutional republic. In our independent judiciary, the Supreme Court is the last line of defense for the separation of powers, and the rights and liberties guaranteed by the Constitution.â An earlier version of this article misstated the proportion of documents from Judge Brett Kavanaughâs time in the White House Counselâs Office that have been made available to the Senate Judiciary Committee. The committee was given 445,000 of 663,000 total documents, which is a portion but not a small portion of the total. Charlie Savage and Catie Edmondson contributed reporting.

Oliver (Want to get this briefing by email? Hereâs the sign-up.) Good evening. Hereâs the latest. 1. President Trump called on the Justice Department to investigate who wrote an anonymous Op-Ed in The New York Times assailing his administration. âI would say Jeff should be investigating who the author of that piece was because I really believe itâs national security,â he said on Air Force One, referring to Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Separately, George Papadopoulos, a former Trump campaign adviser who last year pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I., was sentenced to 14 days in jail. _____ 2. Despite President Trumpâs rage, this week illustrated why almost all elected Republicans have quietly supported him through his travails â or at least not chastised him too loudly. As the confirmation hearings for Judge Brett Kavanaugh came to a close, Senate Republicans pressed steadily through angry liberal protests and sharp questions fromDemocrats. It may deliver one of the Trump administrationâs most enduring legacies: an ideological shift in the Supreme Court that will last for decades. Above, Senator Charles Grassley, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. For an idea of what abortion rights may look like if Judge Kavanaugh joins the Supreme Court, our reporter writes, just look to Arkansas. _____ 3. The U.S. added 201,000 jobs last month, slightly topping analystsâ expectations. The unemployment rate stayed at 3.9 percent, but a 0.4 percent monthly increase in average hourly earnings relieved some of the anxiety about sluggish wages. President Trump escalated the trade dispute with China, threatening to tax virtually all Chinese imports. But so far, political intrigue and anxieties over a trade war have done little to dent a 95-month streak of job creation. _____ 4. More turbulence at Tesla. Shares dropped sharply after news that its accounting chief had departed just weeks after joining the company. The departure is the latest in a string of nearly a dozen top executives who have left Tesla this year. Hours earlier, Teslaâs chief executive, Elon Musk, appeared live on YouTube in an interview with the comedian Joe Rogan and seemed to be smoking marijuana. Mr. Muskâs stability and managerial fitness have come under scrutiny after he unexpectedly tweeted he planned to take the company private, then reversed course. _____ 5. Alex Jones is facing a reckoning. After news that Twitter had permanently banned his personal account and that of Infowars, his company, the big question is whether his hallmark bluster can see him out of his current peril. With tech giants â including Facebook, Pinterest, YouTube and Apple â cracking down on him, Mr. Jonesâs ability to reach his audience has been cut off. But heâs as much marketer as ideological warrior, selling products to assuage the fears he is so expert at stoking. And true to form, heâs been using the challenge to move more product. _____ 6. The E.P.A. is reviewing a major law that restricts mercury emissions by coal-burning power plants. The rule, based on decades of research showing that mercury damages the brain, lungs and fetal health, is among the agencyâs costliest but most effective clean-air policies. The re-evaluation fits into a far-reaching administration strategy to loosen environmental rules affecting countless other industries for years to come by adjusting the factors used to judge the benefits to human health that the rule has brought. _____ 7. The latest from the U.S. Open: Rafael Nadal, the No. 1 seed and defending champion, struggled with a sore knee and ended up retiring from his semifinal against No. 3 Juan MartÃ­n del Potro. Novak Djokovic and 21st-seeded Kei Nishikori are vying for the chance to face Del Potro Sunday afternoon. He will be playing his first Grand Slam final since beating Roger Federer to win the U.S. Open in 2009. And Serena Williams will play Naomi Osaka on Saturday. Ms. Williams will be trying to tie Margaret Courtâs record of 24 major singles titles, while Ms. Osaka will be aiming to duplicate a win this spring over Ms. Williams and claim her first Grand Slam title. Check back for updates and results. _____ 8. Voters in Sweden  head to the polls on Sunday, and immigration and crime have taken center stage. The far right is expected to take one-fifth of the vote, and some Swedes worry that one such party is becoming normalized. âThat gives a playground for the real Nazi parties to play and get more ground,â one man said. âItâs like people have forgotten history. How did Hitler come to power? He started out as a nice guy looking out for the working class.â And a researcher found that in Germany, YouTubeâs recommendation system had steered viewers to fringe and conspiracy videos on a neo-Nazi demonstration. Activists say this may have contributed to a flood of misinformation, helping extremists shape public perceptions even after they had been run off the streets. _____ 9.

Jerry Brown is weighing a bill that would push back many schoolsâ start time to 8:30 a.m., a change that some say could go a long way toward helping students learn. This weekâs Magazine is devoted to education, with stories about educators across the country who take second jobs to support themselves, a debate over what teachers can say in the classroom and a question of whether good teaching can be taught. _____ 10. Finally, this is your periodic reminder that itâs not all bad news out there.

Will it matter? By Michelle Goldberg Opinion Columnist Obviously, I believe Christine Blasey Ford, the psychology professor who says that Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her in high school while his friend Mark Judge watched and, at moments, egged him on. I believe her when she says that Kavanaugh, who she says was drunk, held her down, covered her mouth when she tried to scream, and ground against her while attempting to pull her clothes off. I believe her when she says this incident haunted her all her life. Thereâs rarely hard evidence in a case like this, but Blasey â the surname she prefers to use publicly â has done everything possible to substantiate her claim. Speaking to The Washington Post, she produced notes from a therapist she saw in 2012, whom sheâd told about being attacked by students âfrom an elitist boysâ schoolâ who grew up to become âhigh-ranking members of society in Washington.â According to her husband, that year she identified Kavanaugh to him by name. When Kavanaugh appeared on a shortlist of potential Supreme Court picks â but before his nomination had been announced â Blasey contacted both The Post and her member of Congress, Anna G. Eshoo of California. By all indications, she wanted to head his nomination off without being forced into the spotlight. Blasey passed a polygraph administered by a former F.B.I. agent. The utility of polygraphs is dubious, but her willingness to take one is evidence of her sincerity. According to Axios, some Republicans wanted to call on Blasey to testify publicly, assuming sheâd decline. But on Monday morning, Blaseyâs lawyer, Debra Katz, said that her client is willing to appear before Congress. Kavanaugh denies the allegation unequivocally; on Monday he said heâs willing to rebut it before the Senate Judiciary Committee. (Judge, who wrote a memoir of his teenage alcoholism, has veered between denying the incident and saying he doesnât recall it.) But itâs a sign of how credible Blasey seems that, since this story broke, much of the public debate has been less about whether her accusations are true than whether they are relevant. Some conservatives â though not just conservatives â insist that it is unfair to judge a middle-aged man for things he did as a kid. On Fox News, the former George W. Bush press secretary Ari Fleischer pondered the weight of high school misbehavior. âShould that deny us chances later in life?â he asked. âEven for Supreme Court job, a presidency of the United States, or you name it?â Such arguments would be more convincing if people on the right werenât so selective in their indulgence. Donald Trump called for the death penalty for the Central Park Five, who were 14 to 16 years old when they were arrested. (Theyâve since been proven innocent.) Children are regularly put on sex offender registries, sometimes for their entire lives, for conduct less serious than what Kavanaugh is accused of. In a sour irony, some legal experts think Kavanaughâs confirmation could imperil Miller v. Alabama, a 2012 decision banning life sentences without parole for most teenage convicts. Anyway, this is no longer just about what Kavanaugh might have done 36 years ago. We need to determine, as best we can, if heâs lying now. The Judiciary Committee will be able to begin trying to do that at a public hearing next Monday â called by the committee's head, Charles Grassley, under pressure from some members of his own party. Senators should also demand that Kavanaughâs old friend Judge, who grew up to become a right-wing writer, testify, though Kavanaugh would surely prefer other character witnesses. (âOh for the days when President George W. Bush gave his wife, Laura, a loving but firm pat on the backside in public,â Judge once wrote. âThe man knew who was boss.â) There is a small, dark part of me that thinks it would be fitting if Republicans shove Kavanaugh through despite the allegations against him. Anyone Trump nominates is going to threaten Roe v. Wade. Kavanaugh would at least make plain the power dynamics behind forced pregnancy. We would lose Roe because a president who boasted of sexual assault, elected against the wishes of the majority of female voters, was able to give a lifetime Supreme Court appointment to an ex-frat boy credibly accused of attempted rape. Kavanaugh, helped by an all-male Republican caucus on the Judiciary Committee, would join Clarence Thomas, whose confirmation hearing helped make the phrase âsexual harassmentâ a household term. They and three other men would likely vote against the courtâs three women. The brute imposition of patriarchy would be undeniable. If the Kavanaugh nomination is scuttled, chances are Republicans will try to replace him with someone like Amy Coney Barrett, who is in some ways more conservative. She would put a softer, female face on the culture war. But thatâs a fight for another day. On Sunday, Politico quoted a lawyer close to the White House as saying that the administration had redoubled its support for Kavanaugh in light of Blaseyâs claims: âIf somebody can be brought down by accusations like this, then you, me, every man certainly should be worried.â If the Kavanaugh nomination goes forward, itâs because Trump and his allies believe that a certain class of men accused of sexual assault deserve impunity. The question now is whether any Republican senators believe otherwise. Michelle Goldberg has been an Opinion columnist since 2017. She is the author of several books about politics, religion and women’s rights, and was part of a team that won a Pulitzer Prize for public service in 2018 for reporting on workplace sexual harassment issues.  @michelleinbklyn  Advertisement",0.11,0.793,0.097,-0.9491,0.4570129426129427

Hereâs the sign-up.) Good morning. Hereâs what you need to know: Judge Brett Kavanaughâs nomination has come to symbolize Republicansâ yearning to shape the future of the federal judiciary. His confirmation hearings begin today, and you can keep up with developments here. A conservative stalwart who would replace the courtâs swing vote, Judge Kavanaugh, 53, would probably tilt the court to the right. We look at his likely role as a justice, and  where he stands on major issues. â¢ Opponents will probably present the judge as a far-right extremist who would roll back abortion rights and protect President Trump from the threat of subpoena. Democrats have already protested the White Houseâs decision to withhold 100,000 pages of documents related to his work in the George W. Bush administration. âTwo easy wins now in doubt because there is not enough time. Good job Jeff.â That was President Trumpâs latest salvo against his attorney general, criticizing the Justice Departmentâs decision to bring criminal charges against two Republican congressmen before the midterm elections. In tying law enforcement decisions to Republicansâ chances to keep control of the House, Mr. Trump drew rebukes from former prosecutors and members of his own party. â¢ Separately, we look at how the Justice Department has redefined decades of civil rights enforcement to focus on protecting people of faith, police officers and local government officials. The magazine decided to withdraw an invitation to President Trumpâs former chief strategist to speak at this yearâs New Yorker Festival after several others said they would drop out in protest. âI will not take part in an event that normalizes hate,â the filmmaker Judd Apatow said. David Remnick, the magazineâs editor, initially defended Mr. Bannonâs participation, but he reconsidered after the withdrawals and a furor on social media. â¢ Mr. Bannon called Mr. Remnick âgutless.â A looming assault on Idlib Province could deliver a decisive military blow against rebel fighters, prompting Western leaders to warn of an impending humanitarian calamity. âAttacking the whole of Idlib to eliminate some radical groups would mean causing the death of hundreds of thousands of people and making 3.5 million people leave their homes one more time,â Mevlut Cavusoglu, Turkeyâs foreign minister, said. â¢ About 30,000 rebels are believed to be in the area, along with millions of noncombatants. A year after the storm, progress in Texas is unevenly distributed, leaving many minority and low-income residents struggling. Our Houston bureau chief and a photographer look at those left behind. A recent survey showed that 27 percent of Hispanic Texans whose homes were badly damaged reported that those homes remained unsafe to live in, compared with 20 percent of blacks and 11 percent of whites. â¢ The Times Magazine also looked in detail at one family, tracing exactly what went wrong with response plans and communications networks. â¢  Americans have started shopping in stores again. But in a broad reordering of the $3.5 trillion retail industry, the companies that learned how to match the instant gratification of e-commerce are capturing more gains. â¢ Amazon, which dominates online retail, is quickly gathering momentum in the $88 billion online ad market. â¢ The chairman of NBC News defended the networkâs handling of Ronan Farrowâs reporting on Harvey Weinstein last year, saying the work was not âfit for broadcast.â Mr. Farrow and one of his sources pushed back. â¢ The U.S.  is making it harder to hire foreigners by denying visas, asking for more information and delaying approvals, say corporate leaders who complain that harsher policies are inhibiting business. â¢ U.S. markets were closed on Monday for Labor Day. Hereâs a snapshot of global markets today. Tips for a more fulfilling life. â¢ Protect your cellphone and data when you travel. â¢ Good apps for managing your money. â¢ Recipe of the day: Try a vegan dinner of Thai curry vegetables. â¢ Senator John McCain was buried at the Naval Academy Cemetery, after a funeral in which two former presidents gave eulogies. â¢ The National Museum of Brazil, already in disrepair, was gutted by fire. We looked at some of the  20 million items that may have been lost. â¢ A judge in Myanmar sentenced two Reuters journalists who had reported on the Rohingya genocide to seven years in prison for violating the Official Secrets Act, despite police testimony that they had been set up. â¢ The father of Mollie Tibbetts, an Iowa college student, asked that her death not be used to advance âviews she believed were profoundly racist.â An undocumented immigrant is a suspect in her killing. â¢ A new face for Nike Colin Kaepernick, the former N.F.L. quarterback who led player protests, is to take part in a âJust Do Itâ campaign. â¢ Stealth assaults Microwave weapons, causing sonic delusions and brain damage, could be behind baffling attacks on American diplomats and family members in Cuba and China, specialists say. Hereâs more from this weekâs Science section. â¢ Francis embraces silence The pope has ignored the growing clamor for him to address allegations that he covered up sexual abuse. âThe truth is humble, the truth is silent,â he said in a homily at the Vatican. â¢ Colonizing Rome Thousands of sea gulls have taken over the Italian capital, invading homes, disrupting concerts and targeting the Vaticanâs peace doves.

We can only hope to recover our history from the ashes. Now, we cry and get to work.â â Maurilio Oliveira, a paleoartist at the National Museum of Brazil, which burned down Sunday night. â¢ The Times, in other words Hereâs an image of todayâs front page, and links to our Opinion content and crossword puzzles. â¢ What weâre reading Michael Roston, an editor for science, recommends this article in The Atlantic: âVice President Mike Pence plays a central role in the Trump administrationâs plans for NASA, the Space Force and business in orbit. He also invokes religious themes in speeches about space. Itâs not new â this writer, Marina Koren, finds religious themes throughout the existence of the space program.â As the country mourns the loss of Senator John McCain, thereâs a story from his past worth mentioning. A sensationalist Russian tabloid published a report in 2008 that purported to explain Mr. McCainâs antipathy to Russia. A government-funded Russian newspaper helped disseminate the story, in which Yuri Truschechkin, a former Soviet lieutenant colonel, said he had shot down Mr. McCainâs plane in North Vietnam in 1967. Mr. McCain spent more than five years as a prisoner of war. Mr. Truschechkin came forward, according to the report, after recognizing Mr. McCain during coverage of his presidential campaign. âHe always hated the Russians,â Mr. Truschechkin said. âHe knew that it was our rocket that downed his plane.â (Watch the video coverage.) Mr. Truschechkin, 70, had led a less than illustrious life, and was surviving on a pension of just over $450 a month. The story prompted some Russians to call for him to be honored. Just two months later, Russian newspapers reported that Mr. Truschechkin had died of cancer. He was said to have had just one question for Mr. McCain: whether he had finished reading the works of Karl Marx.

Hereâs the sign-up.) Good morning. Hereâs what you need to know: Ayanna Pressley upset the 10-term Representative Michael Capuano in a Massachusetts primary on Tuesday, becoming the latest Democratic underdog to ride a restless political climate to victory. Much like the win of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in New York, Ms. Pressleyâs success delivered a message to the Democratic establishment that progressive newcomers, especially women and minorities, were unwilling to wait their turn. Her campaign slogan: âChange canât wait.â No Republican is on the November ballot to oppose Ms. Pressley, who would be the stateâs first African-American woman in Congress. â¢ In Chicago, Mayor Rahm Emanuel announced that he would not seek re-election after nearly eight years in office. No clear front-runner has emerged to replace him. Senators will get their first chance to question Judge Brett Kavanaugh under oath about his record and legal opinions today. Abortion, gun rights and the scope of executive power are likely to come up â and our Politics section will have updates from 7 a.m. Eastern. The first day of the confirmation process for the Supreme Court, normally a contentious but decorous affair, verged on pandemonium on Tuesday. Here are the takeaways. Democrats repeatedly interrupted the Senate Judiciary Committee chairman, Charles Grassley of Iowa, demanding time to review documents released the night before. Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, denounced the hearing as âa charade and a mockery.â Dozens of protesters were led out in handcuffs. â¢ Judge Kavanaugh described himself as impartial and âpro-law.â Democrats portrayed him as a narrow-minded conservative partisan. Executives from Facebook and Twitter will testify today about their response to foreign interference in elections and their moderation practices. Theyâre expected to take a conciliatory approach, but it remains to be seen how theyâll respond to accusations of bias. Hereâs what to watch for. While the companies have tried to crack down on hate speech, they acknowledge they have been slow to act. Some content that violates Facebook rules thrives in private groups. â¢ Can you identify posts designed to fool you? Take our quiz. âFear,â by the veteran journalist Bob Woodward, is the latest book to describe top officials working to undermine President Trumpâs impulses and privately insulting him. The anecdotes, gathered by nameless interviews with current and former officials, include Defense Secretary Jim Mattis comparing Mr. Trump to a âfifth or sixth grader,â and Gary Cohn, then the chief economic adviser, removing an important letter from the Oval Office desk so the president would forget to sign it. (According to the book, he did forget.) Mr. Trump accused Mr. Woodward of making up quotes and of running âa con on the public.â â¢ Here are the bookâs key takeaways and our review. Hiring the former N.F.L. quarterback who led player protests for an ad campaign is in line with decades of practice by a company that rarely shies away from politics. Some people burned their shoes in protest, while others cheered. But analysts say the risk could pay off with young customers, many of whom want their brands to take social positions. â¢ Mr. Kaepernick has controlled his own narrative largely by remaining silent. He has refused interviews and uses his Twitter account mostly to share othersâ thoughts. â¢ Amazon hit $1 trillion in value on Tuesday, becoming the second U.S. company, after Apple, to cross the once unthinkable threshold. â¢ Richard Liu, the founder of the Chinese online retailer JD.com, was arrested in Minnesota on Friday on a rape allegation, the police said on Tuesday. â¢ Wealthy countries have effectively outsourced their carbon pollution by importing more steel, cement and other goods. â¢ Britain needs stronger unions, an increased minimum wage, more affordable housing and higher taxes on the rich to to address its economic failings and rising inequality, according to a report by a committee that included academics, business executives, a trade union leader and the archbishop of Canterbury. â¢ U.S. stocks were down on Tuesday.

The war weighed heavily on America, even on one of its favorite pastimes: baseball. A âwork or fightâ order for men in nonessential jobs was issued in July 1918, and the baseball season was cut short. On this day that year, the World Series began in Chicago. It was the earliest calendar date in the history of the series. And the game, between the Boston Red Sox and Chicago Cubs, provided another first. As the small crowd stood for the seventh-inning stretch, the military band began to play âThe Star-Spangled Banner.â Red Sox third baseman Fred Thomas, playing while on furlough from the Navy, stood at attention with a military salute. âFirst the song was taken up by a few, then others joined, and when the final notes came, a great volume of melody rolled across the field,â said a spirited Times report. The song was âan outburst of patriotism which caused every motherâs son in the stands to forget all about baseball.â It was the first time the anthem was sung at a major American sporting event. The song was played for the rest of the series, and for many more games to come. Remy Tumin wrote todayâs Back Story. _____ Your Morning Briefing is published weekdays and updated all morning.

Thirty years of warfare over judicial nominations culminated on Tuesday in the chaotic beginning of Senate consideration of the nomination of Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, a tumultuous 90-minute first act that no one in the hearing room had ever seen before in decades of such events. Democrats on the typically staid, decorous committee immediately interrupted Senator Charles E. Grassley, the Iowa Republican who leads the panel, as he opened the proceedings. They sought to postpone the hearing, fuming over a Labor Day night dump of 42,000 pages of documents less than 24 hours before the committee would convene. Protesters, mostly women, shouted objections to Judge Kavanaugh and President Trump from the public seats throughout the day and were ejected by the Capitol Police. Republicans, many of them well acquainted with Judge Kavanaugh for years, seethed. Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Republican, lamented that the committee was being subjected to âmob ruleâ and that if the hearing room was a courtroom, the Democrats would be held in contempt. The nominee â and his family and friends â sat stoically absorbing the scene that must have been somewhat overwhelming. But it should not have been unexpected. Democrats, with little recourse for stopping the nomination under changes in Senate confirmation practices, were determined to make a loud show of resistance and deploy any available weapons, which at this stage amounted to lodging procedural objections, issuing vehement complaints and articulating fears about the decline of the Senateâs role in confirmations. âIâm just sorry to see the Senate Judiciary Committee descend this way,â said Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont and a former chairman of the panel. âIâve felt privileged to serve here under both Republican and Democratic leadership for over 40 years. This is not the Senate Judiciary Committee I saw when I came to the U.S. Senate.â The intense clash came just days after a series of memorial services for Senator John McCain and a call to bipartisanship, but that sentiment was definitely not in attendance at the hearing. Republicans wryly noted that Democrats admitted they had conferred with Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, over the weekend about their hearing strategy. Senator Ben Sasse, Republican of Nebraska, said opponents were spouting âdrivelâ and âderanged commentsâ about Judge Kavanaugh. Republicans circulated their scorecard listing the number of Democratic interruptions (63) versus mentions of Judge Kavanaughâs judicial opinions (âjust 12â). Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, attributed the commotion to âfolks who want to run for president, who want their moment in the spotlight.â âFrankly, I wish we could drop all this nonsense,â Mr. Hatch said. But Democrats were in no mood to drop their furious objections. Their central complaint is that Republicans have moved forward with the confirmation despite the fact that tens of thousands of documents from Judge Kavanaughâs time in the White House have not been disclosed and that the National Archives was not given time to do its own traditional records review. Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois and longtime member of the panel, told Judge Kavanaugh that the lack of records amounts to a â35-month black hole in your White House career.â To Democrats, the Kavanaugh timetable stands in stark â and infuriating â contrast to the Republican decision in 2016 to deny any hearing at all to Judge Merrick B. Garland, President Barack Obamaâs nominee to replace Justice Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court after his death. âWhen Justice Scalia died, Republicans refused to even meet â even a meeting in their office â with President Obamaâs nominee and held the seat open for one year,â said Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the senior Democrat on the panel. âNow with a Republican in the White House, theyâve changed their position. The majority rushed into this hearing and is refusing to even look at the nomineeâs full record.â Republicans responded that the real way to judge the nomineeâs record was through his more than 300 opinions while on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, calling much of the material sought by Democrats irrelevant. âReviewing Judge Kavanaughâs staff secretary documents would teach us nothing about his legal views,â Mr. Grassley said. The hearing is presenting a formidable challenge to Mr. Grassley, who over his long career has sought to cultivate a reputation for fairness. Democrats appealed to that desire to be seen as equitable, even as they carefully criticized the way he is presiding over the Kavanaugh review. âSir, based upon your own principles, your own values, I call for at least to have a debate or a vote on these issues and not for us to rush through this process,â said Senator Cory Booker, Democrat of New Jersey, who has worked closely with Mr. Grassley on criminal justice issues. At the same time, Mr. Grassley was pressed by his own Republican Party for giving Democrats too much latitude in making their case. But Mr. Grassley said he was willing to take as long as it might to move forward. âWeâre going to be in session Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday until we get done this week,â Mr. Grassley said. âSo however long people want to take, weâre going to not necessarily accommodate all obstruction, but if people got something to say, this chairmanâs going to let them say it.â Democrats say their concerns about the nomination, the hearing and the way it was being conducted were only heightened by Mr. Trumpâs weekend tweet expressing unhappiness with the recent indictment of two House Republicans. They seem certain to press Judge Kavanaugh about the presidentâs view and his own on whether the president is above the law. âAs a former prosecutor, this is abhorrent to me,â Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, said about the presidentâs tweet. Democrats know they have little chance of slowing, let alone stopping, the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh as Republicans seem solidly behind him. Senator Mazie K. Hirono, Democrat of Hawaii, admitted as much, saying that some battles are worth fighting despite the likely outcome. And Democrats appear quite ready to fight to the extent they can.

By Paul Krugman Opinion Columnist Activists in Maine opposed to the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court are trying to put pressure on Susan Collins, the stateâs Republican senator. If Collins votes for Kavanaugh, they say, they will donate substantial sums to her opponent in the next election. Whatever you think of Kavanaugh, this is surely a legitimate tactic: Donors and activists try to influence politiciansâ votes all the time, often by warning of adverse electoral consequences if the politicians make what the activists consider the wrong choice. Last year, for example, major Republican donors openly threatened to withhold contributions unless the party gave them a big tax cut. But now Collins, other Republicans and conservative activists are describing the pressure over Kavanaugh as âbribery,â âextortionâ and âblackmail.â And some of those claiming that normal political activism is somehow illegitimate are the very same big donors who warned Republicans to pass tax cuts or else. Calling this about-face hypocrisy is fair, but feels inadequate. Weâre looking at something much bigger and more pervasive than mere hypocrisy: Weâre talking about bad faith on an epic scale. âBad faithâ is, by the way, a legal term, referring to âentering into an agreement without the intention or means to fulfill it, or violating basic standards of honesty.â In politics, it usually means pretending to be committed to principles you abandon the moment they become inconvenient. And bad faith in this sense pervades almost everything the modern G.O.P. says and does. The very process that brought Kavanaugh to the brink of a lifetime Supreme Court appointment was saturated in bad faith. Remember, Republicans wouldnât even give President Barack Obamaâs nominee a hearing, claiming that because Obama was late in his second term the process should wait, leaving a court seat vacant for more than a year, to let voters weigh in. Now theyâre trying to ram Kavanaugh through in a matter of weeks, despite incomplete vetting of his legal record and major questions about his personal history. (Explosive sexual charges aside, will anyone ask about his huge personal debts?) Why the rush? Because thereâs a chance the G.O.P. will lose the Senate soon. That whole thing about letting the voters have their say was dishonest from the beginning. And there are many more examples. Remember when Paul Ryan posed as the ultimate guardian of fiscal responsibility, releasing manifestoes warning in dire terms of the âcrushing burden of debtâ? The moment Republicans found themselves in control of the White House, Ryan helped ram through a huge tax cut that will add $1.5 trillion to the deficit. Ryanâs hyperventilating about the deficit was focused mainly on social programs; in particular, he proposed large cuts to Medicare, converting it into a voucher program that would eventually receive far less money than the existing program. Some pundits praised his courage in making such a proposal. But now a political action committee tied to Ryan is running ads falsely accusing Democrats of â¦ planning to cut Medicare. Wait, thereâs more. For years, Republicans tarred their opponents as unpatriotic. Remember the whole thing about Obama supposedly apologizing for America? Now we have a president who praises brutal foreign dictators and whose national security adviser and campaign chairman were both undisclosed foreign agents â and it doesnât seem to bother the G.O.P. at all. Oh, and letâs not forget that Bill Clinton was impeached over a consensual affair, because Republicans insisted that the presidentâs personal behavior must be above reproach. Need I say more? And there are many, many more such stories. In fact, whatâs really hard is to come up with significant areas of politics or policy where Republicans are acting in good faith, where their deeds really correspond to the principles they claim to have. Offhand, I canât come up with any examples. Why has the G.O.P. become the party of bad faith? Mainly, I suspect, because its core policy agenda of cutting taxes on the rich while slashing social programs is deeply unpopular. So to win elections it must obscure its true policies â like the Republicans now claiming, falsely, that they want to protect Americans with pre-existing medical conditions â and constantly pretend to stand for things it doesnât actually care about, from fiscal probity to personal responsibility. The key thing to realize about the G.O.P.âs near-total commitment to bad faith is that voters arenât the only victims. Itâs true that many Trump supporters will get a rude shock if Republicans hold Congress, imagining that theyâre making America great and losing their health care coverage instead. But bad faith takes a moral toll on Republican politicians, too. We keep seeing people who once appeared to have some sense of decency turn into abject apparatchiks. Remember when Lindsey Graham seemed to have some independent conscience? Is Susan Collins next? Instead of attacking those activists back in Maine, she should be thanking them, for giving her one last chance to save her political soul.

Shear, Adam Liptak and Sheryl Gay Stolberg WASHINGTON â Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh, President Trumpâs nominee to the Supreme Court, on Wednesday dodged direct questions about whether the Constitution would allow Mr. Trump to use the powers of the presidency to thwart the Russia collusion and obstruction investigations that are swirling around his administration. Testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee on a grueling second day of hearings, Judge Kavanaugh refused to say whether he believes Mr. Trump, as a sitting president, could be subpoenaed by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, to testify in the sprawling inquiry. Answering questions in public for the first time since his nomination, the judge also declined to say whether Mr. Trump could escape legal jeopardy by pardoning himself or his associates. âIâm not going to answer hypothetical questions of that sort,â Judge Kavanaugh said, insisting that it would be inappropriate for a Supreme Court nominee to publicly offer views on issues that might come before the court once he is a justice. Judge Kavanaugh also declined to say he would disqualify himself from cases concerning Mr. Trump. In a hearing that began in the morning, stretched into the night, and seesawed between intense grilling by Democrats and fawning praise by Republicans, Judge Kavanaugh sought to present himself as an evenhanded arbiter of the law rather than a partisan ideologue driven by a desire to carry out a Republican policy agenda. He parried questions, without any obvious blunders, on matters ranging from abortion to gun rights to executive powers and arcane provisions of antitrust law. At least two more days of hearings remain, but absent a startling revelation, he appears headed to confirmation by the end of the month because Republicans remain largely united behind his nomination. But Judge Kavanaugh did little to win over Democrats. Speaking generally, he insisted that he would be an independent justice prepared to rule against the president who appointed him. âNo one is above the law in our constitutional system,â he said. At the same time, he did not retreat from views offered in law review articles that revealed a robust conception of presidential power, views he said had been forged in large part by five years of service in the White House under President George W. Bush. Under attack from progressives and Democrats who say he will roll back abortion rights, Judge Kavanaugh said he believes that Roe v. Wade, the 1973 landmark Supreme Court case establishing a womanâs right to an abortion, was âsettled as a precedent of the Supreme Court,â and as such, deserves respect from judges. But he did not say whether he believes Roe was correctly decided. But then he noted a subsequent case, the 1992 case of Planned Parenthood v. Casey, which narrowed the scope of Roe at the same time that it reaffirmed Roe as a precedent. Casey, which gave states the authority to regulate abortion so long as those regulations do not pose an âundue burdenâ on the woman, is âprecedent on precedent,â he said. On that issue and others, Judge Kavanaugh repeatedly sought to demonstrate empathy, telling senators that when it comes to understanding the real-life implications of abortion, âI donât live in a bubble. I understand. I live in the real world.â He defended his dissent last year in Garza v. Hargan, in which he argued that the Trump administration should have been allowed to temporarily block an undocumented teenager from having an abortion while it sought to place her with a sponsor. He said he had followed Supreme Court precedents, even as he acknowledged that there was no directly applicable case. âI did my level best in an emergency posture,â Judge Kavanaugh said. He said that took the teenagerâs situation into account. âI tried to recognize the real-world effects on her,â he said. âI said consider the circumstances. Sheâs a 17-year-old, by herself, in a foreign country. In a facility where sheâs detained. And she has no one to talk to. And sheâs pregnant. Now that is a difficult situation.â Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, said Judge Kavanaugh had participated in an attempt to deny the teenager access to a constitutional right, placing her health at risk. [Have questions about the hearings? Submit them for our Supreme Court correspondent.] Protesters continued to interrupt the hearing, adding to the tension after an opening day on Tuesday in which dozens of people were arrested after loudly disrupting the proceedings. There were more arrests on Wednesday. One woman was led out of the hearing room shouting âsham president, sham justiceâ; another hollered, âYouâre gaslighting the American people,â drowning out Judge Kavanaugh as he calmly carried on. Democratic senators angrily railed against a swiftly moving confirmation process, accusing Republicans on the committee of refusing to make public documents that they said call into question Judge Kavanaughâs honesty about his past congressional testimony and his record as a political operative and a lawyer in the Bush White House. Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, raised two Bush-era scandals with Judge Kavanaugh, and he suggested that Bush White House emails in the Judiciary Committeeâs possession may contradict testimony the nominee made more than a decade ago â if only they could be released publicly. One of the scandals was the disclosure in late 2003 and 2004 that a Republican Judiciary Committee staff member had infiltrated the Democratsâ confidential internal files about which of President George W. Bushâs judicial nominees to try to block and with what tactics. The other was the disclosure that after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, the Bush administration had secretly ordered the National Security Agency to intercept Americansâ phone calls and emails without obtaining the judicial warrants seemingly required by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. At his appeals court confirmation hearing in 2006, Judge Kavanaugh â who had worked as an associate White House counsel in the Bush administration â told senators that he did not know anything about the infiltration of Senate Democratsâ files on judicial nomination fights or about the warrantless wiretapping program before they eventually became public. But Mr. Leahy indicated that documents marked âcommittee confidentialâ â and kept secret from the public â provide evidence that Judge Kavanaugh had contact with Manuel Miranda, then a Republican staff member on the Judiciary Committee, and had more involvement with the surveillance program than he had acknowledged. âI am concerned because there is evidence that Mr. Miranda provided you with materials that were stolen from me,â Mr. Leahy said. âAnd that would contradict your prior testimony. It is also clear from public emails â and Iâm refraining from going into nonpublic ones â that you had reason to believe materials were obtained inappropriately at the time.â Judge Kavanaugh insisted that everything he had testified to before was â100 percent accurate,â but indicated that he was not sure what Mr. Leahy was referring to. With Democrats casting him as a partisan who was nominated by Mr. Trump only to protect the president, Judge Kavanaugh spent considerable time trying to demonstrate his independence. One case he cited to buttress his argument was notable: United States v. Nixon, the 1974 decision in which the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that President Richard M. Nixon had to comply with a subpoena seeking tapes of his conversations in the Oval Office. In 1999, Judge Kavanaugh mused aloud that âmaybe Nixon was wrongly decided.â He made the statement soon after serving under Ken Starr, the independent counsel who investigated President Bill Clinton. Judge Kavanaughâs allies have said he meant the statement as a critique of the legal strategy of Mr. Clintonâs lawyers. But on Wednesday, he called it âone of the greatest moments because of the political pressures of the time.â âThe courts stood up for judicial independence in a moment of national crisis,â Judge Kavanaugh said, ranking the decision as one of the Supreme Courtâs greatest achievements. Judge Kavanaugh also sought to portray himself as an advocate for women. He described sexual harassment allegations against Alex Kozinski, a former federal appellate judge for whom he once clerked, as âa gut punch for me,â and said he knew nothing of the behavior. And he told the committee he has made aggressive effort to hire female clerks; 25 of his 48 clerks were women. Judge Kavanaugh sidestepped questions from Senator Cory Booker, Democrat of New Jersey, about his personal views on affirmative action and racial profiling, even as Mr. Booker said Judge Kavanaugh was hostile to affirmation action and open to racial profiling. But the judge defended his decision upholding South Carolinaâs voter identification law, arguing that he had taken the âreal-world effectâ into account and had forced the state to take steps to insure that the law did not impose an undue burden on black people. On gun rights, Judge Kavanaugh told the committee the Second Amendment protected the right of Americans to own semiautomatic rifles because they are in âcommon useâ and not a âdangerous and unusual weaponâ â a position he took in a much-publicized 2011 dissent, which he said was rooted in Supreme Court precedent. That prompted an outcry from Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the top Democrat on the judiciary panel. âHow do you reconcile what youâve just said with the hundreds of school shootings using assault weapons that have taken place in recent history?â she asked. âSenator, of course the violence in the schools is something we all detest,â the judge replied. But he added, âAs a judge my job, as I saw it, was to follow the Second Amendment opinion of the Supreme Court.â Get politics and Washington news updates via Facebook, Twitter and the Morning Briefing newsletter.

Kavanaugh spent a long day answering â and often failing to answer â questions about some of the most pressing issues that could reach the Supreme Court in the years ahead. Hereâs a look at three of them. By Adam Liptak Asked about the constitutional right to abortion, Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh talked instead about precedent. He described the Supreme Courtâs two key decisions: Roe v. Wade, the 1973 ruling that established a constitutional right to abortion, and Planned Parenthood v. Casey, the 1992 decision that reaffirmed the core of that right. Collectively, he said, the two decisions held that âa woman has a constitutional right to obtain an abortion before viability subject to reasonable regulation by the state up to the point where that regulation constitutes an undue burden on the womanâs right to obtain an abortion.â But that was description, not endorsement. He did suggest that the Roe decision may be a particularly secure precedent. âItâs not as if itâs just a run-of-the-mill case that was decided and never been reconsidered,â he said. âThat makes Casey a precedent on precedent.â Like earlier nominees, he recited the reasons offered in the Casey decision for leaving precedents undisturbed, including whether people have relied on the decisions, whether the decisions have proved workable as a practical matter and what impact overruling them would have on public perception of the Supreme Courtâs legitimacy. âPeople rely on the decisions of the courts, and so reliance interests are critically important to consider as a matter of precedent,â Judge Kavanaugh said. âPrecedent also reinforces the impartiality and independence of the judiciary,â he said. âThe people need to know in this country that the judges are independent, and that weâre not making decisions based on policy views.â But Judge Kavanaugh did not say whether he would be prepared to reconsider Roe, and he declined an invitation to agree with a statement from the Casey decision that the right to abortion allows women to âparticipate equally in the economic and social life of the nation.â He said instead that the right to abortion was âsettled as a precedent of the Supreme Court.â That statement is less categorical than it appears at first blush. To call a decision âsettled lawâ is not to say it is set in stone. Judge Kavanaugh expressed dismay about gun violence. But he defended a robust view of Second Amendment rights. He was asked about his 2011 dissent in a case that upheld a ban in Washington on so-called assault weapons. The case was a sequel to District of Columbia v. Heller, the 2008 Supreme Court decision that established a constitutional right to own handguns for self-defense in the home, striking down an earlier Washington law. The majority in the appeals court ruled that the later ban was constitutional. On Wednesday, Judge Kavanaugh explained that he dissented because Justice Antonin Scaliaâs majority opinion in the 2008 decision required it. He acknowledged that Justice Scalia had said that many gun control laws were unaffected by the 2008 ruling. âNothing in our opinion,â Justice Scalia wrote, âshould be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms.â Judge Kavanaugh also said that the 2008 decision allowed machine guns to be prohibited, along with âdangerous and unusual weapons.â But he said semiautomatic weapons presented a different question. âMost handguns are semiautomatic â something not everyone appreciates,â Judge Kavanaugh said on Wednesday. Similarly, he said, âsemiautomatic rifles are widely possessed in the United States.â âI have to follow the precedent of the Supreme Court as itâs written, and thatâs what I tried to do in that case,â he said. Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, asked Judge Kavanaugh about the practical impact of his position in light of recent school shootings. He responded that school officials have taken steps to protect students. âSenator,â he said, âof course the violence in the schools is something we all detest and want to do something about, and there are lots of efforts, I know, underway to make schools safer. I know at my girlsâ school they do a lot of things now that are different than they did just a few years ago in terms of trying to harden the school and make it safer for everyone.â âBut as a judge my job, as I saw it,â he said, âwas to follow the Second Amendment opinion of the Supreme Court whether I agreed with it or disagreed with it.â Judge Kavanaugh made broad pronouncements on the independence of the judiciary, and he praised the Supreme Courtâs unanimous 1974 decision ordering President Richard M. Nixon to comply with a subpoena seeking tapes of his conversations in the Oval Office. âIt was one of the greatest moments because of the political pressures of the time,â he said of the decision, United States v. Nixon. âThe courts stood up for judicial independence in a moment of national crisis.â That ruling would, of course, figure in the resolution of any dispute between Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election, and President Trump. It was hard to escape the conclusion that Judge Kavanaugh was trying to assure senators that he might be prepared to rule against the president who nominated him, as Chief Justice Warren Burger did in the Nixon tapes case. But when Judge Kavanaugh was asked more specific questions about Mr. Trump, he declined to answer. âCan a sitting president be required to respond to a subpoena?â Ms. Feinstein asked. Judge Kavanaugh said that was âa hypothetical question about what would be an elaboration or a difference from U.S. v. Nixonâs precise holding.â âI canât give you an answer on that hypothetical question,â he said. He gave a similar answer to whether Mr. Trump could pardon himself. âThe question of self-pardons is something Iâve never analyzed,â he said. âIt is a question that Iâve not written about. It is a question therefore that is a hypothetical question that I canât begin to answer in this context as a sitting judge and as a nominee to the Supreme Court.â Adam Liptak covers the Supreme Court and writes Sidebar, a column on legal developments.

Kavanaugh are set to emerge on Tuesday when he appears on Capitol Hill for the opening of his Supreme Court confirmation hearings. One is a champion for women; the other a threat to womenâs rights. Republicans will present Judge Kavanaugh to the nation as an experienced, independent-minded jurist with a sparkling rÃ©sumÃ©, and as an advocate and mentor for women in the judiciary. Among the cases they will cite: his 2009 ruling in favor of Emilyâs List, the group that backs Democratic women who support abortion rights. Democrats will tell an entirely different story, painting Judge Kavanaugh as a far-right extremist who would roll back abortion rights, deny health coverage to people with pre-existing conditions, protect President Trump from the threat of subpoena â and as someone who may have misled Congress when he testified during his appeals court confirmation hearing in 2006. Those two competing narratives will define the contours of a deeply partisan and immensely consequential battle over Mr. Trumpâs Supreme Court nominee. But while Democrats vowed early on to scuttle the Kavanaugh nomination â Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader, promised to âoppose him with everything Iâve gotâ â they are unlikely to find success. Democrats have been unable to muster much public outrage over his nomination or Republicansâ refusal to grant them full access to documents from Judge Kavanaughâs time working for former President George W. Bush. Even the Trump White Houseâs decision over the weekend to keep 100,000 pages secret produced little blowback. On Monday night, just 13 hours before the hearings were to begin, lawyers for Mr. Bush gave the Senate 42,000 pages of confidential documents, prompting an irate Mr. Schumer to call the document production process âabsurd,â on Twitter, adding, âNot a single senator will be able to review these records before tomorrow.â Democrats also fell flat in their effort to delay the hearings after Mr. Trumpâs former lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, implicated the president in a hush-money scheme to influence the 2016 election. Judge Kavanaugh, 53, has spent the past 12 years on the federal appeals court here â a traditional steppingstone to the Supreme Court. If he is confirmed, he will shape the course of American jurisprudence for generations to come, filling the seat long occupied by the retired Justice Anthony M. Kennedy â a critical swing vote on divisive matters like same-sex marriage and abortion â with a committed conservative who would push a rightward-leaning court even further in that direction. âThe stakes are so high,â said Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut and a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee. âWeâre talking about a vote on the United States Supreme Court that could well decide whether women can decide when they want to have children, and whether Americans can decide whom they want to marry.â But Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the Judiciary Committee chairman, argued in an interview Monday that it was folly to try to predict how Judge Kavanaugh might vote on any given matter. âHow do I know what heâs going to rule on 10 years from now?â Mr. Grassley asked. âAll I want is somebody thatâs going to interpret the Constitution strictly and leave legislating to the Congress of the United States, and I think heâs the sort of guy who will do that.â The hearings will play out for the next four days before the judiciary panel, with opening statements on Tuesday by senators and Judge Kavanaugh, followed by two days of questioning and a final day of testimony from outside witnesses. As Mr. Blumenthal, perhaps in a moment of understatement, predicted, âSparks will fly.â Judge Kavanaughâs views on reproductive rights and Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 case legalizing abortion, will take center stage. In addition to demanding to know whether he believes the case was correctly decided â a question he is all but certain to refuse to answer â Democrats will question him aggressively about his dissent in the case of Garza v. Hargan, in which he argued that a 17-year-old undocumented immigrant should not be permitted to have an immediate abortion. They have called Rochelle Garza, the girlâs lawyer, as a witness. And in this era of #MeToo, Democrats also plan to raise pointed questions about Judge Kavanaughâs views on sexual harassment. Senator Mazie Hirono, Democrat of Hawaii, plans to ask Judge Kavanaugh if he has ever sexually harassed anyone â a question she said she asks of all nominees â and will also ask him about a judge for whom he clerked, Alex Kozinski, who abruptly retired last year from the federal appeals court amid harassment allegations. Republicans intend to push back by highlighting Judge Kavanaughâs record of hiring female clerks â 25 of his 48 clerks have been women â and by making the case that he has taken pains to mentor women. Among those who will formally introduce him on Tuesday are Condoleezza Rice, the former secretary of state, and Lisa S. Blatt, a self-described âliberal Democrat and feministâ lawyer who has advocated Judge Kavanaughâs confirmation. âWe want to lay the groundwork to show that this has been a judge who is empowering and mentoring women,â said one Senate Republican aide, speaking anonymously to discuss strategy. Judge Kavanaugh has expressed strong support for executive power, hostility to administrative agencies, and support for religious freedom and for gun rights. Democrats will press him on all of these topics, but are expected to drill especially deeply into his assertion, in a 2009 Minnesota Law Review article, that sitting presidents should be âexcused from some of the burdens of ordinary citizenship,â including responding to civil and criminal lawsuits. Those comments are especially relevant in light of the special counsel investigation being led by Robert S. Mueller III. Democrats want Judge Kavanaugh to commit to recusing himself from ruling on matters involving that inquiry â a commitment he will undoubtedly avoid making. But perhaps the most blistering accusation Democrats will levy is that Judge Kavanaugh was untruthful during his 2006 testimony, when he told the judiciary panel that he was ânot involved in the questions about the rules governingâ the treatment of terror suspects. A White House spokesman, Raj Shah, has said the testimony âaccurately reflected the facts.â An email, recently made public as part of a trove of Bush records, shows that while working in the Bush White House Counselâs Office, the future judge volunteered to prepare a senior Bush administration official to testify about the governmentâs monitoring of conversations between certain terrorism suspects and their lawyers. Democrats, led by Senators Richard J. Durbin of Illinois and Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, had questioned Judge Kavanaughâs veracity even before that emailâs release. In an interview, Mr. Leahy drew a comparison between Judge Kavanaugh and Judge Jay S. Bybee, who was confirmed to the federal appeals court in 2003 â years before the release of memos showing that, as head of the Justice Departmentâs Office of Legal Counsel, he had given the C.I.A. its first detailed legal approval for waterboarding and other harsh interrogation techniques. âHad that come out before the confirmation,â Mr. Leahy said, âI doubt very much that he would have been confirmed.â In a narrowly divided Senate â 50 Republicans, 47 Democrats and two independents who caucus with Democrats â the Kavanaugh nomination could be defeated if all Democrats hang together and one Republican votes no. But two Republicans most likely to cross the aisle, Senators Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine, both supporters of abortion rights, have made favorable comments about Judge Kavanaugh. And at least three Democrats â Joe Donnelly of Indiana, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Joe Manchin III of West Virginia â are facing re-election in states won by Mr. Trump and are under intense pressure to vote in favor. None of those senators are on the Judiciary Committee. Supreme Court confirmation hearings are always as much about political theater as they are about substance, and Judge Kavanaughâs will be no exception. Several Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee â Cory Booker of New Jersey, Kamala Harris of California and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota â are possible 2020 presidential aspirants and will no doubt take advantage of the free national television exposure. Judge Kavanaugh, too, will take advantage of that limelight. In the nearly two months since Mr. Trump nominated him, he has been a silent presence in Washington, traipsing through the corridors of the Capitol complex, trailed by a retinue of security officers and advisers, as he made the customary âcourtesy visitsâ to senators. Now he will have a chance to speak for himself, spotlighting his academic pedigree â he has undergraduate and law degrees from Yale â and addressing questions not only about his judicial record, but also the more contentious aspects of his rÃ©sumÃ©, including his days working for Kenneth W. Starr, the independent counsel who investigated former President Bill Clinton. While there, he urged prosecutors to pose graphic questions to Mr. Clinton about his relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky â a history that Democrats will invoke as they try to cast Judge Kavanaugh as a partisan political operative. âWill the real Brett Kavanaugh please stand up?â said Carrie Severino, chief counsel and policy director of the Judicial Crisis Network, a conservative advocacy group. âYou hear very contrasting views. This is a chance for people to see who is telling the truth about Judge Kavanaugh, and what is just spin.â Follow Sheryl Gay Stolberg on Twitter @SherylNYT    Advertisement",0.071,0.849,0.08,-0.1573,0.41247079085788757

Schmidt WASHINGTON â A secretive letter shared with senators and federal investigators by the senior Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee charges that a teenage Brett M. Kavanaugh and a male friend trapped a teenage girl in a bedroom during a party and tried to assault her, according to three people familiar with the contents of the letter. The letter says that Mr. Kavanaugh, then a student at Georgetown Preparatory School in suburban Washington and now President Trumpâs Supreme Court nominee, had been drinking at a social gathering when he and the male friend took the teenage girl into a bedroom. The door was locked, and she was thrown onto the bed. Mr. Kavanaugh then got on top of the teenager and put a hand over her mouth, as the music was turned up, according to the account. But the young woman was able to extricate herself and leave the room before anything else occurred, the letter says. The woman says she considered the episode an assault. She has declined to be publicly identified, and she asked Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, not to publicize the letter. In a statement shared by the White House, Mr. Kavanaugh said the charges were false. âI categorically and unequivocally deny this allegation,â he said. âI did not do this back in high school or at any time.â The friend who is said to have participated, Mark Judge, also denied the episode ever happened. âI never saw anything like what was described,â he said in an interview after being informed that he was named in the letter. Further, he said, it did not match Mr. Kavanaughâs character: âIt is not who he is.â He said that the two were around each other constantly in high school, and recalled him as a âbrilliant student,â who was very into sports, and was not âinto anything crazy or illegal.â Mr. Judge, an author, filmmaker and journalist who has written for the conservative Daily Caller and The Weekly Standard, said that the students were raised in Catholic homes and taught that the kind of behavior as described in the letter would not be tolerated. âSomething like that would stick out,â he said, âwhich is why I donât think it would happen.â The episode took place more than 30 years ago, when all three individuals involved were minors. The New York Times has not seen the letter, but its contents were described by the three people. With speculation about the letterâs contents circulating this week, Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the Republican chairman of the Judiciary Committee, released a different letter on Friday, sent to him and Ms. Feinstein and signed by 65 women who say they knew Judge Kavanaugh while in high school. âThrough the more than 35 years we have known him, Brett has stood out for his friendship, character and integrity,â the women wrote. âIn particular, he has always treated women with decency and respect. That was true when he was in high school, and it has remained true to this day.â Mr. Grassley was still planning to move ahead with Mr. Kavanaughâs confirmation. The Judiciary Committee is scheduled to hold a key vote to advance the nomination next Thursday, and Republican leaders hope to hold a final vote of the full Senate before the end of September to allow Mr. Kavanaugh to be seated before the start of the Supreme Courtâs fall term next month. Mr. Grassleyâs aides said that Mr. Kavanaugh had been the subject of six F.B.I. background checks since 1993, and none had turned up anything like the episode in question. It was not immediately clear how, if at all, the charges would influence senators who must decide whether to give Mr. Kavanaugh a lifetime appointment to the court. Only a small group of moderate senators remain publicly undecided about their votes, and objections from either one of two undecided Republicans, Senators Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, could thwart confirmation. Ms. Collins spent an hour on the phone with Mr. Kavanaugh on Friday, shortly after details of the letter were first published. The call had been scheduled for days, and neither the White House nor Ms. Collinsâs office would disclose what was discussed. The White House and outside pro-Kavanaugh groups continued to accuse Democrats of playing dirty, withholding mysterious information until the eve of Judge Kavanaughâs confirmation in a last-ditch effort to derail a nominee they have always opposed. âI do not intend to allow Judge Kavanaughâs confirmation to be stalled because of an 11th-hour accusation that Democrats did not see fit to raise for over a month,â Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, said on Friday. He added: âThe claims are wholly unverifiable, and come at the tail end of a process that was already marred by ugly innuendo, dishonesty and the nastiest form of our politics. The American people deserve much better from the Senate as an institution.â Tom Mentzer, a spokesman for Ms. Feinstein, released a statement Friday afternoon that said, âSenator Feinstein was given information about Judge Kavanaugh through a third party.â âThe senator took these allegations seriously and believed they should be public,â the statement continued. âHowever, the woman in question made it clear she did not want this information to be public. It is critical in matters of sexual misconduct to protect the identity of the victim when they wish to remain anonymous, and the senator did so in this case.â The womanâs letter first arrived on Capitol Hill in July, initially to the office of Representative Anna Eshoo, Democrat of California. It was quickly shared with Ms. Feinstein, as well, who from her senior position on the Judiciary Committee would lead Democratic questioning of Judge Kavanaugh. But Ms. Feinstein was torn by competing concerns. The woman made clear that though she had shared the information because she felt it could be relevant to Senate consideration of Judge Kavanaugh, she did not want to come forward or make the accusations public. For weeks, the letter and its contents were closely limited to a tight circle of aides. Ms. Feinstein chose not to raise the matter either publicly or privately during hourslong questioning of Judge Kavanaugh by senators last week, or in written questions sent to the nominee afterward and she did not initially share it with colleagues, including Mr. Grassley. By the time Judge Kavanaugh was on the witness stand, though, its existence had become an open secret on Capitol Hill, with speculation circling among reporters, lawmakers and congressional aides about its contents. The Intercept first reported its existence Wednesday evening. Under pressure from other Democratic senators, who had been fighting a pitched battle against Judge Kavanaugh for weeks â largely over access to documents from his years in the George W. Bush White House â Ms. Feinstein called a meeting late Wednesday to share with the lawmakers the letterâs contents but not the letter itself. Several of those senators advised Ms. Feinstein to at least share the letter with law enforcement authorities. On Thursday, she announced in a cryptic statement that she had sent âinformation from an individual concerning the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Courtâ to the authorities, but only after redacting the womanâs name from the document. Others wanted to take a more aggressive tack and push what they saw as serious accusations into public view, despite the womanâs concerns, Senate officials familiar with the matter said. Ms. Feinsteinâs statement appears to have been an attempt to account for both demands. The F.B.I. has not opened a criminal investigation into the matter, but added the letter to Judge Kavanaughâs background file. That updated file was in turn shared with the White House on Thursday and then sent to Capitol Hill, where it will be kept in the office of the chairman for review by senators. Senators themselves had little to say publicly about the accusations on Friday. The new details seemed merely to harden the position of outside groups that have conducted an expensive war over the nominee, with at least one liberal group, NARAL Pro-Choice America, calling for Mr. Kavanaugh to withdraw his nomination. âA womanâs identity should not have to be revealed to take her story seriously and pursue justice on her behalf,â the groupâs president, Ilyse Hogue, said in a statement. âThe charge of sexual assault against Brett Kavanaugh is disqualifying and we call on him to immediately withdraw his nomination for the Supreme Court.â Carrie Severino, chief counsel and policy director of the Judicial Crisis Network, the conservative group pressing for Judge Kavanaughâs confirmation, drew the opposite conclusion, insisting there should be no delay in the confirmation process. âThis is nothing more than a last-minute attempt at character assassination,â she said.

Kavanaugh, and the woman who has accused him of sexual assault before the committee on Monday for extraordinary public hearings only weeks before the midterm elections. In setting the hearing, Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, backed down from a committee vote on Judge Kavanaughâs nomination, planned for this Thursday, and pushed a confirmation once seen as inevitable into limbo. The hearing with Judge Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, a research psychologist in Northern California, sets up a potentially explosive public showdown that carries unmistakable echoes of the 1991 testimony of Anita Hill, who accused the future Justice Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment in an episode that riveted the nation and ushered a slew of women into public office. It will play out against the backdrop of the #MeToo movement, which has energized Democratic women across the United States, in an institution, the Senate, that is more than three-quarters male. Mr. Trump vigorously defended his nominee on Monday, calling him an âoutstandingâ judge with an unblemished record, and dismissing as âridiculousâ the prospect that Judge Kavanaugh might withdraw his nomination. âHe is somebody very special; at the same time, we want to go through a process, we want to make sure everything is perfect, everything is just right,â Mr. Trump told reporters at the White House. âIf it takes a little delay, it will take a little delay â it shouldnât certainly be very much.â The announcement of Mondayâs hearing capped a tumultuous day in Washington, as senators of both parties absorbed the accusations against Judge Kavanaugh, who only last week seemed on a glide path toward confirmation. Dr. Blasey has said he sexually assaulted her at a social gathering in the 1980s when they were both teenagers. Judge Kavanaugh has categorically denied the accusations, which Dr. Blasey detailed in a letter sent in July to Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, who kept its existence secret until last week at Dr. Blaseyâs request. (She uses the surname Blasey professionally, though news accounts have also referred to her by her married name, Ford.) By Monday, both the contents of the letter and Dr. Blaseyâs identity had spilled out into the open, intensifying what had already been a nasty partisan battle over Judge Kavanaughâs confirmation. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, angrily assailed Democrats for raising the accusations at the last minute. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, demanded the F.B.I. investigate, and raised questions about Judge Kavanaughâs veracity. On Monday evening, The Mercury News in California published the accounts of two friends of Dr. Blaseyâs who said that she told them in July that she was going forward with her accusations. It will be up to Judge Kavanaugh to convince wavering senators of his innocence. Both Senators Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, and Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, said Monday that if true, Dr. Blaseyâs accusations would disqualify the nominee from the Supreme Court. âObviously, if Judge Kavanaugh has lied about what happened, that would be disqualifying,â Ms. Collins told reporters, adding, âFor my part, I believe that itâs very important that both Professor Ford and Judge Kavanaugh testify under oath about these allegations. I need to see them and listen to their answers to the questions in order to make an assessment.â Mr. Flake told reporters that he is âpresupposing nothing with this hearing,â but added, âIf you believe the charges are true, you vote no.â Washingtonâs advocacy machinery also sprang to life. A conservative advocacy group said that it would spend $1.5 million on a television advertising campaign to defend Judge Kavanaugh, while a liberal group announced a $700,000 ad buy intended to pressure senators in swing states. Allies of Judge Kavanaugh made public letters from two former girlfriends, attesting to his character, while a hashtag sprang up on Twitter: #BelieveChristine. Judge Kavanaugh spent the day at the White House, huddling and strategizing with aides in a war room across from the West Wing from which they had meticulously planned his path to confirmation. On Monday, though, the discussions were about how to salvage his chances through a hearing that officials were resigned to becoming a dramatic public spectacle. Eager to defend himself from an accusation he insisted was untrue, Judge Kavanaugh had wanted to put out a statement over the weekend signaling his willingness to address the charge with the committee, according to allies and an administration official who insisted on anonymity to characterize his thinking. But Donald F. McGahn II, the White House counsel, and others urged Judge Kavanaugh to hold back until they had a chance to determine how seriously the accusation was being taken. They believed there might be a chance that, working with Mr. McConnell and Republicans on the Judiciary Committee, they could push past the accusation of a decades-old episode and handle it privately while keeping a Thursday vote on track. By Monday morning, however, with Dr. Blaseyâs lawyer saying Dr. Blasey was willing to appear in front of Congress, Mr. McGahn and others changed course and agreed that Judge Kavanaugh should put out his statement. âI have never done anything like what the accuser describes â to her or to anyone,â the statement said. âBecause this never happened, I had no idea who was making this accusation until she identified herself yesterday.â On Capitol Hill on Monday, Mr. Grassley and Mr. McConnell initially resisted calls for hearings, and instead arranged telephone calls to allow Republican and Democratic aides to interview both Judge Kavanaugh and Dr. Blasey â a plan that Mr. Schumer rejected as âa biased, far-fetched process.â But by dayâs end, Republican leaders concluded that it would be necessary to move forward to satisfy the concerns of senators in both parties. Still, there were other Republicans who feared the committee had made a dangerous misstep in agreeing so quickly to a public hearing. Without having fully deposed either Dr. Blasey or Judge Kavanaugh, these Republicans fear that the party and the White House could unexpectedly and irrevocably lose control of the nomination when the witnesses take the stand. Ms. Feinstein, meanwhile, accused Republicans of rushing into the hearing to block an investigation into Dr. Blaseyâs accusations. âIâm disappointed the F.B.I. and White House are failing to take even the most basic steps to investigate this matter,â she said in a statement issued late Monday. Both in the letter to Ms. Feinstein and in an interview published Sunday by The Washington Post, Dr. Blasey said that during a gathering of teenagers at a private home in suburban Montgomery County, Md., the future Judge Kavanaugh, along with a friend, pushed her into a bedroom as she was making her way to a bathroom. She said the young Mr. Kavanaugh jumped on top of her, grinding his body against hers as he tried to remove her clothing. When she tried to scream, she said, he clapped his hand over her mouth to muffle the cries. âThey both laughed as Kavanaugh tried to disrobe me in their highly inebriated state,â she wrote in the letter, made public Monday by CNN. âWith Kavanaughâs hand over my mouth I feared he may inadvertently kill me.â Her lawyer, Debra Katz, said in an interview that Dr. Blasey was ready to go before the committee. âWe hope that this hearing is fair and not another weaponized attack on a woman who has come forward with allegations of sexual misconduct against a powerful man,â Ms. Katz said. Public hearings could be charged, especially in a political year marked by rising female political activism and a surge of female candidates. No Republican women serve on the Judiciary Committee, and senior Republican men appeared ready to defend the nominee. âI believe him,â Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, who serves on the Judiciary Committee, told reporters after a private phone call with Mr. Kavanaugh on Monday afternoon. Mr. Hatch said he saw âlots of reasonsâ not to believe Dr. Blaseyâs accusation. âHe is a person of immense integrity,â the senator said. âI have known him for a long time. He has always been straightforward, honest, truthful and a very, very decent man.â Ms. Feinstein came in for particular criticism from Republicans who took shots at her for withholding the information about Dr. Blasey until last week. âIf they believe Judge Kavanaughâs accuser, why didnât they surface this information earlier so that he could be questioned about it?â Mr. McConnell asked. âAnd if they didnât believe her and chose to withhold the information, why did they decide at the 11th hour to release it?â Ms. Katz said Ms. Feinstein withheld the letter because she was respecting Dr. Blaseyâs wishes to remain private. Ultimately, after rumors of the letter circulated on Capitol Hill, and she was confronted by Democratic colleagues on the Judiciary Committee, Ms. Feinstein referred the letter to the F.B.I. Asked why she had waited so long, the senator hesitated. âI donât know; Iâll have to look back and see,â Ms. Feinstein told reporters, before ducking into the Senate chamber. When she emerged, she said, âThe answer is that she asked that it be confidential.â Nicholas Fandos, Catie Edmondson and Eileen Sullivan contributed reporting.

By Ross Douthat Opinion Columnist âWhile on the surface it is the embryoâs fate that seems to be at stake,â the sociologist Kristin Luker wrote in 1984, âthe abortion debate is actually about the meaning of womenâs lives.â This line, from Lukerâs book âAbortion and the Politics of Motherhood,â neatly encapsulates a longstanding pro-choice charge against the pro-life movement. As much as opponents of abortion claim to care about the killing of the unborn, the argument goes, in reality abortion restriction is a means to a different end: The restraint of womenâs choices, the restriction of their sexual freedom, their subordination to the rule of fathers and husbands and patriarchy writ large. The reality has always been more complicated. From the beginning of the modern anti-abortion movement â whose origins lie in the 1960s, not just the aftermath of Roe v. Wade â it has included female leaders who identify as pro-life feminists and reject the idea that female liberty depends on a right to kill your unborn child. And while the pro-life grass roots tended to be strongly traditionalist on gender roles in the 1970s, with time pro-life and pro-choice citizens converged in their views on womenâs roles; by the late 2000s, the Claremont McKenna professor Jon Shields wrote in a 2012 commentary on Lukerâs book, a clear majority of pro-lifers voters held views that sociologists would describe as âgender egalitarian,â not traditionalist or Gileadean. At the same time the abortion-rights movement was linked in its early days to a distinctive form of upper-class WASP paternalism â in which legal abortion was sold as a means of helping upper-class âgood girlsâ out of trouble while keeping the undesirable fertility of other classes and races in check. And from Hugh Hefnerâs early abortion-rights advocacy to a certain style of predatory male feminism today, support for legal abortion among men has often carried a strong whiff of self-interest, with feticide as a get-out-of-responsibility-free card for caddish men. But with all this said, itâs also obvious that social conservatism can lapse into a version of Lukerâs portrait, and itâs easy to think of examples â the Todd Akin fiasco of 2012, for instance â where a cruelly sexist form of anti-abortion politics reared an ugly head. Which is why the allegation of sexual assault against Brett Kavanaugh represents a uniquely dangerous moment for a pro-life movement that has spent decades working toward the goal of a fifth Supreme Court vote to amend or overturn Roe v. Wade.  Kavanaugh may be innocent. The allegation against him is plausible but not nearly as dispositive as the cascade of #MeToo claims that have felled other prominent men. If it is false, the work of a faulty or disoriented memory, then he is in a legitimately terrible position, with a lifetimeâs reputation for probity at stake and no clear way to clear his name. Which is why the accuser cannot shirk testifying publicly, as her lawyer suggested last night, and expect her claims to keep him from the Supreme Court. But she may testify, and her story may be true. And it has landed at a moment of great cultural peril for a type of social conservatism that regards itself as idealistic and pro-woman and capable of marrying its convictions to support for female advancement and empowerment. In its targets the #MeToo movement has made no partisan distinctions; if anything, it has probably ended the careers of more prominent liberal pigs than right-wing men. But for reasons of political expedience, conservatives have been more likely to make excuses for their predators, and indeed have elevated one of the more prominent examples to the White House. That elevation, and the Trumpification of the right it has required, has accelerated the political polarization of the sexes, so that what was once a milder gender gap is now an extraordinary gulf. Thanks to Trump and his enablers, then, liberals and the Democratic Party have been able to take the long list of Hollywood creeps and Acela-corridor bounders and say, look, we have a problem, but weâre dealing with it. While conservatives and the Republican Party are stuck as the vehicle for male defensiveness and anti-#MeToo backlash. Which, to be clear, sometimes has a point. False rape accusations against privileged-white-male targets (the Duke lacrosse team, the imaginary Haven Monahan at the University of Virginia) are real enough, and the style of anti-rape policies on college campuses really has gone too far in traducing the rights of accused men. But among men who are legitimately prominent, not just unfortunate collegians, there have been few cases of late where the accusations have seemed trumped-up or the punishment too severe. The âplightâ of Louis C.K. or Charlie Rose inspires no sympathy, and the attempts at reflection and self-rehabilitation by various fallen men â John Hockenberry in Harperâs, Jian Ghomeshi in The New York Review of Books â have mostly been obtuse. And the fact that Ronan Farrow can claim a legitimate scalp every month suggests that the âhas it gone too far?â plaints are still premature. A Trumpified conservatism, though, will necessarily struggle to acknowledge any of this, because of what it would suggest about Trumpâs own fitness for his office. And such a conservatism â much-more-heavily male than the Reagan or Bush G.O.P., organized around the fears and grievances of prominent men, and seemingly indifferent to the legitimacy of certain kinds of female anger â will end up defining all its constituent parts, all its causes and concerns, as subordinate to the defense of male impunity. This includes the pro-life movement. Even if it wins its long-desired victory at the high court and more anti-abortion legislation becomes possible, a pro-life cause joined to a party that canât win female votes and seems to have no time for women will never be able to achieve those legislative goals, or at least never outside a very few, very conservative states. And having that long-awaited victory accomplished by a male judicial appointee confirmed under a cloud of #MeToo suspicion seems like a good way to cement a perception thatâs fatal to the pro-life movementâs larger purposes â the perception that you canât be pro-woman and pro-life. This points to a conclusion thatâs certainly unfair to Kavanaugh if heâs innocent, but nobody ever said that politics would be fair. If his accuser testifies publicly and credibly, if her allegation isnât undermined by a week of scrutiny and testimony, if it remains unprovable but squarely in the realm of plausibility, then all the abortion opponents who were supporting him should hope that his nomination is withdrawn â with, ideally, a woman nominated in his place. That would be a political gamble in its own right, of course, and one that the Trump White House will take only under duress. But if Kavanaugh is a qualified judge, no judicial nominee is indispensable. And for a movement that risked so much to make these nominations possible, there is no reason to compound that risk unless this nominee can find a way to decisively persuade the country, however unfair that burden may seem, that he did not treat Christine Blasey Ford with the cruelty alleged this week.

On Sunday, August 26, they're taking their case to the streets with a national ""Unite for Justice"" day of action to demand the Senate reject Kavanaugh's nomination. Kavanaugh's views suggest he'd be open to undermining the equal rights of women and lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people. He may also be hostile to voting rights, abortion rights, Obamacare, and net neutrality. SEE ALSO: 5 ways you can fight Trump's Supreme Court pick The progressive organizations NARAL Pro-Choice America and MoveOn oppose Kavanaugh's nomination and are leading ""Unite for Justice"" protests this Sunday. With more than 75 organizations involved and more than 180 events set to take place in all 50 states, the efforts are expected to result in the largest single-day protest of a Supreme Court nominee in history. Here's everything you need to know about how you can join the fight against Kavanaugh's confirmation, both on Sunday and beyond. Since every state has events planned for the day of action, you should be able to find a rally near you. The Unite for Justice website provides a map so you can see every event across the country, and it also has a helpful search tool that allows you to filter events by city, state, or zip code. If you don't find an event as close to you as you'd like, the website also offers information on how to host your own and register a Unite for Justice event such as a rally, press conference, and march, or even a petition delivery or potluck in your area.

""Brett Kavanaugh will vote to end Roe v. Wade, criminalize abortion, gut the Affordable Care Act, roll back LGBTQ rights, and decimate the Voting Rights Act and Affirmative Action,"" Ilyse Hogue, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, said in a statement. ""Brett Kavanaugh will vote to end Roe v Wade..."" If Kavanaugh were to overturn Roe v. Wade and limit legal access to abortions, he would essentially send America back to a society that resembles The Handmaid's Tale. Though Kavanaugh recently told Sen. Susan Collins of Maine he feels Roe v. Wade is ""settled law,"" that doesn't mean he'll vote to uphold it in the future. Chief Justice Roberts once made the same claim and has since voted to undermine access to women's healthcare and the right to abortion on several occasions.  Image:  unite for justice Kavanaugh, who once suggested a sitting president can't be indicted, also seems to believe the Supreme Court should put the president above the law â a viewpoint that seems immensely problematic, especially considering the legal drama currently surrounding Trump. Trump's former campaign chairman Paul Manafort was recently found guilty on eight counts of tax fraud charges, bank fraud, and hiding foreign bank accounts, and his former lawyer, Michael Cohen, reached a plea deal with federal prosecutors, implicating Trump in campaign finance crimes. ""There's the threat that Kavanaugh could allow Trump to place himself above the law at a time when there is an active investigation into potentially criminal wrongdoing.""

By Serena Mayeri Ms. Mayeri teaches law and history at the University of Pennsylvania Law School. Judge Brett Kavanaughâs voluminous record, his opinion of the Supreme Courtâs landmark abortion ruling, Roe v. Wade, and his views on legal precedent have deservedly been scrutinized in the lead-up to his confirmation hearings next week. But the Supreme Courtâs 1992 decision in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, more than Roe, holds the key to understanding the stakes of Judge Kavanaughâs potential confirmation.  It is Casey that now protects womenâs access to reproductive health care in states whose restrictions on health care providers and patients threaten to close clinics or ban abortions outright. And the political lesson conservatives learned from Casey all but guarantees that a vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote not only to endanger abortion rights but to turn back the clock on a century of progressive reforms. On the eve of the presidential election of 1992, the court seemed poised to reconsider Roe in a case challenging several Pennsylvania abortion restrictions. Abortion-rights advocates thought Roeâs demise certain. They worried most that the court might gut Roe without overruling it. A decision that openly reversed Roe might galvanize abortion-rights voters in November. But if women slowly lost the right to choose abortion, no electoral reckoning would follow.  The courtâs decision in Casey surprised everyone: Justices Anthony Kennedy, Sandra Day OâConnor and David Souter co-authored an opinion that upheld the core holding of Roe but gave states more leeway to regulate abortion through âinformed consentâ requirements, waiting periods and other barriers. Instead of the âstrict scrutinyâ that doomed most restrictions under Roe, a more pliable âundue burdenâ standard would apply to abortion regulations.  Activists on both sides condemned the ruling, but Casey included something for everyone. The decision placed abortion rights on firmer constitutional footing by grounding them in womenâs dignity and equality. Women, the court said, needed reproductive choice to determine their individual destinies and to participate fully in the economic and social life of the nation. At the same time, Casey upheld statesâ interest in protecting potential life, approving all but one of the challenged Pennsylvania regulations. As abortion-rights leaders feared, Caseyâs undue burden standard allowed more restrictions than Roe. Many states have enacted laws that drastically limit access to reproductive health care, particularly for poor, rural and immigrant women who cannot afford to miss work and make repeated trips to clinics hundreds of miles away. But in 2016, Justice Kennedy provided the crucial vote to strike down, under Casey, a Texas law that shuttered half the stateâs clinics by imposing excessively burdensome requirements on them.  For anti-abortion activists, Casey confirmed the paramount importance of judicial appointments. Caseyâs co-authors were all Republican appointees. Anti-abortion conservatives vowed that never again would they allow a Republican president to squander Supreme Court nominations on unreliable judges.  Abortion opponents, like their adversaries, recognize the potential for electoral backlash if the court reverses Roe outright. Many would prefer abortion rights to die gradually and quietly. Merely by interpreting Casey to allow increasingly restrictive laws, the Supreme Court can stealthily smother choice without appearing to deliver a death blow. Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, said this summer that she could not support a nominee who had âdemonstrated hostility to Roeâ or to âestablished precedent.â Judge Kavanaugh reportedly told Ms. Collins recently that he considered Roe to be âsettled law.â These statements should reassure no one. Casey, not Roe, is the established precedent that matters here. And it seems more likely that abortion rights will die a death by a thousand cuts through restrictive state laws allowed under Casey than by a reversal of Roe. Either way, a vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to diminish reproductive freedom.  It is also a vote to advance a larger agenda. Over several decades, the conservative legal movement has linked opposition to reproductive choice with constitutional theories that enhance the rights of corporations at the expense of human beings. Conservatives have tethered the anti-abortion cause to a selective libertarianism that opposes government regulation of business but authorizes expansive executive power and state intrusion on individual liberties. Judge Kavanaugh would not have passed Federalist Society muster if he did not demonstrate allegiance to these principles. With this confirmation vote, then, much more than abortion rights hangs in the balance. So does the countryâs ability to fight voter suppression, political corruption and racial intimidation; to protect clean air and water; to ensure safety for workers and consumers; to combat climate change; to enact sensible gun laws; to voluntarily integrate public schools; to provide necessary health care and preserve a basic social safety net; to protect civil rights and liberties; and to safeguard the integrity of all families.  Americans who put aside their qualms and voted for the president to secure Supreme Court justices who would end legal abortion may pay a high price for their choice. With one more justice, Mr. Trumpâs Republican Party will fully control all three branches of government, eliminating the last check on his power. It matters little, therefore, what Judge Kavanaugh says to senators about Roe or âsettled law.â Conservatives have learned the lessons of Casey too well to permit the appointment of another justice in the Anthony Kennedy mold. And abortion rights are one of many inevitable casualties of this appointment. Senators who vote yes will bear responsibility for all of them.

Kavanaugh, and the woman who has accused him of sexual assault before the committee on Monday for extraordinary public hearings only weeks before the midterm elections. In setting the hearing, Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, backed down from a committee vote on Judge Kavanaughâs nomination, planned for this Thursday, and pushed a confirmation once seen as inevitable into limbo. The hearing with Judge Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, a research psychologist in Northern California, sets up a potentially explosive public showdown that carries unmistakable echoes of the 1991 testimony of Anita Hill, who accused the future Justice Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment in an episode that riveted the nation and ushered a slew of women into public office. It will play out against the backdrop of the #MeToo movement, which has energized Democratic women across the United States, in an institution, the Senate, that is more than three-quarters male. Mr. Trump vigorously defended his nominee on Monday, calling him an âoutstandingâ judge with an unblemished record, and dismissing as âridiculousâ the prospect that Judge Kavanaugh might withdraw his nomination. âHe is somebody very special; at the same time, we want to go through a process, we want to make sure everything is perfect, everything is just right,â Mr. Trump told reporters at the White House. âIf it takes a little delay, it will take a little delay â it shouldnât certainly be very much.â The announcement of Mondayâs hearing capped a tumultuous day in Washington, as senators of both parties absorbed the accusations against Judge Kavanaugh, who only last week seemed on a glide path toward confirmation. Dr. Blasey has said he sexually assaulted her at a social gathering in the 1980s when they were both teenagers. Judge Kavanaugh has categorically denied the accusations, which Dr. Blasey detailed in a letter sent in July to Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, who kept its existence secret until last week at Dr. Blaseyâs request. (She uses the surname Blasey professionally, though news accounts have also referred to her by her married name, Ford.) By Monday, both the contents of the letter and Dr. Blaseyâs identity had spilled out into the open, intensifying what had already been a nasty partisan battle over Judge Kavanaughâs confirmation. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, angrily assailed Democrats for raising the accusations at the last minute. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, demanded the F.B.I. investigate, and raised questions about Judge Kavanaughâs veracity. On Monday evening, The Mercury News in California published the accounts of two friends of Dr. Blaseyâs who said that she told them in July that she was going forward with her accusations. It will be up to Judge Kavanaugh to convince wavering senators of his innocence. Both Senators Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, and Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, said Monday that if true, Dr. Blaseyâs accusations would disqualify the nominee from the Supreme Court. âObviously, if Judge Kavanaugh has lied about what happened, that would be disqualifying,â Ms. Collins told reporters, adding, âFor my part, I believe that itâs very important that both Professor Ford and Judge Kavanaugh testify under oath about these allegations. I need to see them and listen to their answers to the questions in order to make an assessment.â Mr. Flake told reporters that he is âpresupposing nothing with this hearing,â but added, âIf you believe the charges are true, you vote no.â Washingtonâs advocacy machinery also sprang to life. A conservative advocacy group said that it would spend $1.5 million on a television advertising campaign to defend Judge Kavanaugh, while a liberal group announced a $700,000 ad buy intended to pressure senators in swing states. Allies of Judge Kavanaugh made public letters from two former girlfriends, attesting to his character, while a hashtag sprang up on Twitter: #BelieveChristine. Judge Kavanaugh spent the day at the White House, huddling and strategizing with aides in a war room across from the West Wing from which they had meticulously planned his path to confirmation. On Monday, though, the discussions were about how to salvage his chances through a hearing that officials were resigned to becoming a dramatic public spectacle. Eager to defend himself from an accusation he insisted was untrue, Judge Kavanaugh had wanted to put out a statement over the weekend signaling his willingness to address the charge with the committee, according to allies and an administration official who insisted on anonymity to characterize his thinking. But Donald F. McGahn II, the White House counsel, and others urged Judge Kavanaugh to hold back until they had a chance to determine how seriously the accusation was being taken. They believed there might be a chance that, working with Mr. McConnell and Republicans on the Judiciary Committee, they could push past the accusation of a decades-old episode and handle it privately while keeping a Thursday vote on track. By Monday morning, however, with Dr. Blaseyâs lawyer saying Dr. Blasey was willing to appear in front of Congress, Mr. McGahn and others changed course and agreed that Judge Kavanaugh should put out his statement. âI have never done anything like what the accuser describes â to her or to anyone,â the statement said. âBecause this never happened, I had no idea who was making this accusation until she identified herself yesterday.â On Capitol Hill on Monday, Mr. Grassley and Mr. McConnell initially resisted calls for hearings, and instead arranged telephone calls to allow Republican and Democratic aides to interview both Judge Kavanaugh and Dr. Blasey â a plan that Mr. Schumer rejected as âa biased, far-fetched process.â But by dayâs end, Republican leaders concluded that it would be necessary to move forward to satisfy the concerns of senators in both parties. Still, there were other Republicans who feared the committee had made a dangerous misstep in agreeing so quickly to a public hearing. Without having fully deposed either Dr. Blasey or Judge Kavanaugh, these Republicans fear that the party and the White House could unexpectedly and irrevocably lose control of the nomination when the witnesses take the stand. Ms. Feinstein, meanwhile, accused Republicans of rushing into the hearing to block an investigation into Dr. Blaseyâs accusations. âIâm disappointed the F.B.I. and White House are failing to take even the most basic steps to investigate this matter,â she said in a statement issued late Monday. Both in the letter to Ms. Feinstein and in an interview published Sunday by The Washington Post, Dr. Blasey said that during a gathering of teenagers at a private home in suburban Montgomery County, Md., the future Judge Kavanaugh, along with a friend, pushed her into a bedroom as she was making her way to a bathroom. She said the young Mr. Kavanaugh jumped on top of her, grinding his body against hers as he tried to remove her clothing. When she tried to scream, she said, he clapped his hand over her mouth to muffle the cries. âThey both laughed as Kavanaugh tried to disrobe me in their highly inebriated state,â she wrote in the letter, made public Monday by CNN. âWith Kavanaughâs hand over my mouth I feared he may inadvertently kill me.â Her lawyer, Debra Katz, said in an interview that Dr. Blasey was ready to go before the committee. âWe hope that this hearing is fair and not another weaponized attack on a woman who has come forward with allegations of sexual misconduct against a powerful man,â Ms. Katz said. Public hearings could be charged, especially in a political year marked by rising female political activism and a surge of female candidates. No Republican women serve on the Judiciary Committee, and senior Republican men appeared ready to defend the nominee. âI believe him,â Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, who serves on the Judiciary Committee, told reporters after a private phone call with Mr. Kavanaugh on Monday afternoon. Mr. Hatch said he saw âlots of reasonsâ not to believe Dr. Blaseyâs accusation. âHe is a person of immense integrity,â the senator said. âI have known him for a long time. He has always been straightforward, honest, truthful and a very, very decent man.â Ms. Feinstein came in for particular criticism from Republicans who took shots at her for withholding the information about Dr. Blasey until last week. âIf they believe Judge Kavanaughâs accuser, why didnât they surface this information earlier so that he could be questioned about it?â Mr. McConnell asked. âAnd if they didnât believe her and chose to withhold the information, why did they decide at the 11th hour to release it?â Ms. Katz said Ms. Feinstein withheld the letter because she was respecting Dr. Blaseyâs wishes to remain private. Ultimately, after rumors of the letter circulated on Capitol Hill, and she was confronted by Democratic colleagues on the Judiciary Committee, Ms. Feinstein referred the letter to the F.B.I. Asked why she had waited so long, the senator hesitated. âI donât know; Iâll have to look back and see,â Ms. Feinstein told reporters, before ducking into the Senate chamber. When she emerged, she said, âThe answer is that she asked that it be confidential.â Nicholas Fandos, Catie Edmondson and Eileen Sullivan contributed reporting.

Added to previous tariffs, the new levies would mean that nearly half of all Chinese imports into the U.S. will soon face extra fees. Mr. Trump also made clear he might go even further, taxing remaining Chinese imports âif China takes retaliatory action against our farmers or other industries.â The president has said that tariffs will save American factories, but history suggests otherwise, our correspondent writes. â¢ The markets: The Chinese stock market opened at a four-year low today before rebounding, and other markets are largely shrugging off the trade news.

The Carolinas were struggling to cope with the effects of record rainfall as the remnants of Hurricane Florence moved out of the region. At least 31 deaths have been attributed to the storm.

During a time when sensationalist journalism was commonplace in media, The Times vowed to avoid such tactics in favor of neutral, fact-based reporting. âWe do not believe that everything in Society is either exactly right or exactly wrong,â Mr. Raymond said in the introductory article of the paperâs first edition. âWhat is good we desire to preserve and improve; what is evil, to exterminate, or reform.â Throughout the years, the paper would shorten its name to The New-York Times and eventually drop the hyphen in favor of its current style.

Hereâs the sign-up.) Good morning. Hereâs what you need to know: A Senate hearing scheduled for Monday to review allegations of sexual assault by the Supreme Court nominee is now in doubt. Christine Blasey Ford, who has accused Judge Brett Kavanaugh of assaulting her at a high school party more than 30 years ago, said on Tuesday that she wanted the F.B.I. to investigate before she testifies. He has categorically denied her accusation. Republicans signaled that they would not postpone the hearing, and would either hold it without Dr. Blasey or declare it unnecessary if she refuses to appear. In a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee, Dr. Blaseyâs lawyers said she had been the target of âvicious harassment and even death threatsâ since her identity had been made public. â¢ A national debate: The accusations are being assessed under different social and cultural conventions than when the assault is said to have occurred. Our reporter looks at what has changed. Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, has committed to some concrete steps toward denuclearization, but they fall far short of what American officials have demanded. During his summit meeting today with President Moon Jae-in of South Korea, Mr. Kim agreed to dismantle a missile testing facility under the supervision of outside experts. He also said he would visit Seoul, the Southâs capital, which would be a first for a North Korean leader. â¢ North Korean demands: Mr. Kim has called for âcorrespondingâ measures from the U.S., like declaring a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, which was halted only with a truce. âItâs back,â a North Carolina resident whose home has flooded twice in two years said on Tuesday. âSame nightmare.â Hurricanes have long been a fact of life in the Carolinas, but the past four years have been particularly punishing. Residents and officials are grappling with where to rebuild and how to prepare for the next storm. âWhen you have two 500-year floods within two years of each other, itâs pretty clear itâs not a 500-year flood,â Gov. Roy Cooper of North Carolina said this week. â¢ Water levels: Our maps show how much record rain pushed rivers in the Carolinas above flood levels. â¢ Shared advice: Readers who have lived through other hurricanes offered tips for those affected by Hurricane Florence. In one of the largest settlements ever awarded to individual victims of sexual abuse in the Roman Catholic Church, four men who were abused as children reached an agreement with the Diocese of Brooklyn and a local after-school program on Tuesday. The assaults took place from 2003 to 2009, the lawyers for the victims said, when the boys were ages 8 to 12. â¢ The crime: The victims were abused by Angelo Serrano, who taught catechism and helped organize religious education programs at a Brooklyn church. He pleaded guilty in 2011 and is serving a 15-year sentence. The Trump administration is unable to account for the whereabouts of nearly 1,500 migrant children who illegally entered the U.S. alone this year and who were placed with sponsors, congressional findings released on Tuesday show. The report has raised concerns that the children could end up with human traffickers or be used as laborers by people posing as relatives. â¢ Government response: âThese children are not âlost,â â a spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services said. âTheir sponsors â who are usually parents or family members and in all cases have been vetted for criminality and ability to provide for them â simply did not respond or could not be reached when this voluntary call was made.â â¢ As the U.S.-China  trade dispute intensifies, the Trump administration has tried to shield products that are popular with American consumers from tariffs. That gets harder with each round. But as Beijing tries to match President Trumpâs announcements, itâs running out of American goods to target. â¢ Facebook is being accused of helping employers exclude female candidates from recruitment campaigns. â¢ New Yorkâs Rust Belt, which once attracted heavy industry, is trying to cope with an influx of Bitcoin speculators.

They shrink from having to go to the polling booths on election days. They would much prefer staying at home and attending to their household duties.â So said an article in The Press of Christchurch, New Zealand, after the country became the worldâs first to give women the right to vote on this day in 1893. When women cast ballots later that year, The Press grudgingly admitted that it had happened without âany very remarkably disastrous consequences.â The victory (which enfranchised Maori women, too) was hard won. The leading causes of death in New Zealand at the time were said to be âdrink, drowning, and drowning while drunk.â With alcoholism taking a toll on family life, the Womenâs Christian Temperance Union â fiercely opposed by the liquor industry â spearheaded the suffrage effort, hoping that enfranchised women could get alcohol banned. (They could not.) Kate Sheppard, New Zealandâs most famous suffragist, noted wryly when the Electoral Act passed that âit does not seem a great thing to be thankful forâ that the government has âdeclared us to be âpersons.â â Other countries gradually followed suit: the U.S. in 1920, India in 1947, Switzerland in 1971.

At least nine deaths were reported as Typhoon Jebi made landfall in southern Japan early Tuesday afternoon. The typhoon, with winds up to 130 miles (209 kilometers) per hour, prompted officials to urge the evacuation of more than a million people. The typhoon comes during a summer plagued with weather issues, including lethal floods and landslides and deadly heat waves. _____ â¢ Outsourced jobs, sure. But outsourced pollution? Wealthy countries have been âoutsourcingâ a big chunk of their carbon emissions abroad. Theyâve done this by importing more steel, cement and goods from factories in China and other countries, rather than producing them domestically. A new report on the global carbon trade estimates that 25 percent of the worldâs total emissions are now being outsourced this way. About 13 percent of Chinaâs emissions in 2015, for example, came from making products for other countries. But thereâs a growing push to close this loophole, and policymakers are looking for a solution. Want to see how your hometown has warmed over the years?

Some Facebook users even provided direct coordinates for targeted attacks. Facebook insists it is policing its Libyan platform, but illegal activity is rife. âSo many times over the past seven years,â one researcher said, âI heard people say that if we could just shut down Facebook for a day, half of the countryâs problems would be solved.â _____ â¢ The newest $1,000,000,000,000 company.

And the judge deserves a chance to clear his name. By David Lat Mr. Lat is a former federal law clerk and prosecutor. In many ways, Judge Brett Kavanaugh is the perfect Supreme Court nominee. For a dozen years, he has served with distinction on the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, the nationâs second most-powerful court. Before that, he held top legal jobs in the federal government, including the White House Counselâs Office, and was a partner at a leading law firm. Heâs almost universally praised by his former clerks, who are Republicans, Democrats and independents. Heâs a devoted husband and father of two daughters who is celebrated as a leader in the federal judiciary when it comes to hiring and mentoring women. During and after his confirmation hearings, many unfair and unfounded charges were made against him. Democratic senators accused Judge Kavanaugh of committing perjury at his two prior confirmation hearings â charges that do not withstand scrutiny. Abortion rights activists attacked him for referring to certain forms of contraception as âabortion-inducing drugsâ â but when he uttered those words, he was simply describing the litigation position of a religious group, not stating his own views. But now Mr. Kavanaugh faces new allegations, brought by a woman named Christine Blasey Ford. Her disturbing claims deserve further investigation by the Senate Judiciary Committee, even if it means delaying his confirmation vote. A delay wouldnât just be for her sake, but for the sake of Judge Kavanaugh and the Supreme Court itself. The story began last week, when Senator Dianne Feinstein forwarded to the F.B.I. a letter in which a woman claimed that Mr. Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when they were both in high school. Initially it seemed that nothing would happen, since the accuser was unwilling to come forward. The F.B.I. declined to open an investigation and the information was simply added to Kavanaughâs background file for senators to consider or ignore as they saw fit. But on Sunday, Ms. Ford, who wrote the letter, broke her silence. In an interview with The Washington Post, the 51-year-old research psychologist claimed that at a summer party in the early 1980s, when she was around 15 and he was around 17, a drunken Mr. Kavanaugh pinned her to a bed, groped her and attempted to remove her clothes. When she tried to scream, she says he put his hand over her mouth. âI thought he might inadvertently kill me,â she told The Post. According to Ms. Ford, at some point Mark Judge, a friend of Mr. Kavanaughâs who was also drunk, jumped on top of them â causing them all to fall to the floor, and allowing her to escape. Mr. Kavanaugh, now 53, has strongly denied her claims: âI categorically and unequivocally deny this allegation. I did not do this back in high school or at any time.â Mr. Judge has also denied the claims. Based on these denials, many supporters of Mr. Kavanaugh view Ms. Fordâs claims, raised after the conclusion of his confirmation hearings and just days before the Senate Judiciary Committee vote, as eleventh-hour character assassination. They argue that his confirmation should move forward, full speed ahead. I respectfully disagree. The confirmation should be delayed until there is a full investigation, followed by Senate Judiciary Committee hearings, into Ms. Fordâs accusations. She passed a polygraph test administered by a former F.B.I. agent, and her therapist provided The Washington Post with notes reflecting that Ms. Ford described the alleged incident in 2012. But her case is far from ironclad. For example, she canât remember or remains uncertain about many key details (including the year of the alleged incident); she told nobody contemporaneously (unlike many other alleged victims of sexual assault); and both Mr. Kavanaugh and his friend deny it. There is, as far as we know, no physical evidence. Itâs a true âshe said, he saidâ â or, rather, âthey said,â since two people deny this incident ever happened. But Ms. Ford should at least be heard, and not just because the #MeToo movement has made the importance of hearing out victims of alleged sexual misconduct even more obvious than it already was. The alleged perpetrator and witness should be heard from as well, and everyone involved should be placed under oath and subjected to aggressive questioning. (At least three Republican senators â Jeff Flake of Arizona, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Bob Corker of Tennessee â have expressed interest in hearing more about Ms. Ford's account, but there's no consensus yet on the preferred process.) The object lesson here is the 1991 confirmation for Justice Clarence Thomas. After a former colleague, Anita Hill, raised allegations of multiple instances of sexual harassment against Mr. Thomas, the senators heard from both key parties before the confirmation vote. The hearings had their flaws. Most notably, several witnesses on Ms. Hillâs side never got to testify. But the core claims were placed before the Senate before the vote. This ultimately redounded to Justice Thomasâs benefit. Now, whenever Ms. Hillâs sexual harassment allegations are raised, he or his defenders can at least say they were explored by the senators and ultimately found insufficient to deny Mr. Thomas a seat on the Supreme Court. If Mr. Kavanaugh is confirmed without further investigation of Ms. Fordâs charges, he and his defenders will not even be able to claim what Mr. Thomasâs defenders can. Judge Kavanaugh will be dogged by these accusations throughout his entire, likely decades-long service on the court. And that will lead some to question the legitimacy not just of his appointment but of the court as an institution â especially when it decides knotty social and political issues by a 5-4 vote. Considering the small number of witnesses involved â perhaps Ms. Ford, Mr. Kavanaugh, Mr. Judge, Ms. Fordâs husband and her therapist â an F.B.I. investigation followed by hearings wouldnât take very long. The process might not be complete before the start of the Supreme Courtâs new term on Oct. 1, but it should easily be able to be done before the midterm elections, if thatâs the concern of Senate Republicans. The way in which Ms. Fordâs allegations came to light was, to put it charitably, deeply unfortunate. These claims should have been thoroughly and discreetly investigated weeks ago, by nonpartisan F.B.I. agents and bipartisan Senate investigators, in a way that protected Christine Fordâs privacy and Brett Kavanaughâs good name. But here we are. It is quite possible â or even likely â that hearings wonât prevent Brett Kavanaugh from being confirmed given the equivocal evidence against him and, perhaps even more important, the number of Republicans and red-state Democrats in the Senate. But due process, which ought to matter when it comes to filling the critical seat on the highest court in the land, calls for nothing less.

Ruiz, Emily Steel, Grace Ashford and Steve Eder The text message from Christine Blasey Ford this summer worried her college best friend, Catherine Piwowarski. Over their years of friendship â as roommates, bridesmaids and parents on opposite coasts â Dr. Blasey wanted to know, had she ever confided that she had been sexually assaulted in high school? No, Ms. Piwowarski said she texted back, she would have remembered that, and was everything O.K.? Dr. Blasey didnât want to speak in detail quite yet, her friend recalled her responding. âI donât know why she was asking that or what it ultimately meant or didnât mean,â Ms. Piwowarski said in an interview, but she remembers thinking that the question betrayed deep turmoil. That was about a month before Dr. Blasey, a research psychologist, came forward with her allegation that Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh, President Trumpâs Supreme Court nominee, sexually assaulted her more than three decades ago when they were high school students in the Washington suburbs. Just days ago, both Dr. Blasey and Judge Kavanaugh â who has denied sexually assaulting her, or anyone â had been expected to testify on Monday before the Senate Judiciary Committee about the allegation, setting up a contest of credibility reminiscent of 1991, when Anita Hill leveled accusations of sexual harassment against Clarence Thomas, then a Supreme Court nominee. But it is increasingly uncertain whether that will happen. Dr. Blaseyâs lawyers on Tuesday called for an F.B.I. investigation of her allegation before she testifies, but the Senate Republican leadership has rejected the idea and said that a vote on the Kavanaugh nomination will go forward if she does not appear. Dr. Blaseyâs allegation has divided not just the Senate and the country, but also the overlapping social circles of the judge and the researcher, as former classmates, colleagues, friends and others have written warring letters of support in recent days. Dr. Blaseyâs lawyers, Debra Katz and Lisa Banks, say that since she went public with her story last weekend, she has been subjected to death threats, had her email hacked and had to leave her home. Speculation has arisen in the capital that Dr. Blasey, who had already been reluctant to come forward, may ultimately decline to testify, at least publicly. Supporters of Dr. Blasey, 51, describe her as a precise, logical scientific thinker; a community leader; a woman of integrity; and a devoted mother of two boys. âHer lifeâs work is about telling the truth with science,â said Kate Beebe DeVarney, a behavioral neuroscientist who has worked with Dr. Blasey in Silicon Valley. âChristine doesnât get stuff wrong. Sheâs obsessive about making sure itâs right,â she added. âIf Christine says something happened, I absolutely believe her.â Backers of Judge Kavanaugh, 53, describe him as a precise, methodical legal thinker; a strong mentor; a pillar of the community where he and Dr. Blasey grew up; and a devoted father of two girls. Mr. Trump this week praised the judge as an âoutstanding intellect,â who ânever had even a little blemish on his record.â Judge Kavanaugh, a Republican, is a staunch Catholic conservative who lives in the nationâs capital. Dr. Blasey, colleagues say, is a Democrat from California who wore a pink âbrain hatâ when she joined fellow academics in protesting the Trump administrationâs proposed cuts to scientific research funding. Their histories coalesced, in Dr. Blaseyâs telling, in the early 1980s, in the insular, moneyed world of Washington private college preparatory schools. She began attending Holton-Arms School, a private girlsâ prep school in Bethesda, Md., in seventh grade, joining a tight-knit group of about 65 girls. High school friends and classmates described âChrissy,â as Dr. Blasey was known then, as a popular girl equally comfortable in math class and at social gatherings. Samantha Semerad Guerry said Dr. Blasey fit right in. Athletic and outdoorsy, she joined the soccer, softball and cheerleading teams. âShe was universally well-liked â always cheerful, affable, funny, and super smart,â Ms. Guerry said. âShe was self-possessed,â recalls Cheryl Aviva Amitay, who graduated in 1985, the year after Dr. Blasey. As a student at Holton-Arms, Dr. Blasey was part of an elite, suburban Washington community, where the families of members of Congress, white-shoe lawyers and lobbyists golfed, played tennis and swam together at a hierarchy of country clubs; Dr. Blaseyâs father, a business executive, formerly served as president of the Burning Tree Country Club. Students at private schools socialized with one another and participated in cross-school events. Children from Catholic schools, like Georgetown Preparatory School, which Mr. Kavanaugh and Justice Neil Gorsuch attended, and Stone Ridge School of the Sacred Heart, a girlsâ school nearby, tended to hang around together, having often come from the same parishes and grade schools, though not exclusively. Ms. Guerry said that she knew Georgetown Prep boys through participating in school performances, and that Brett Kavanaugh was an acquaintance. Drinking was commonplace among the private school teenagers, and the laws governing alcohol and minors were more lax than now. âBack then, pretty much there were parties every Friday and Saturday night, somewhere,â said Samu Qureshi, a friend of Dr. Blaseyâs who attended Landon, the brother school to Holton Arms, two years ahead of her. âGenerally, parents are out and the kids are getting a keg.â Holton-Armsâs yearbook includes pages of photographs of girls with drinks. Boys would be invited from the surrounding schools â Landon, Georgetown Prep, and St. Albans â for dances. Things could get rowdy, especially at unsupervised parties before and after school functions, students from that era recalled. A yearbook entry for Judge Kavanaugh, a varsity football and basketball player at Georgetown Prep, described him as âKeg City Club (Treasurer) â 100 Kegs or Bust.â Mark Judge, a classmate and close friend, describes his own blackout drinking during those years in âWasted: Tales of a Gen X Drunk,â his 1997 memoir about his experiences as a teenage alcoholic. The book mentions a person named âBart OâKavanaughâ who had âpuked in someoneâs carâ and âpassed out on his way back from a party.â Mr. Judge did not respond to queries this week about whether that name refers to Judge Kavanaugh. This was the environment in which Dr. Blasey, when she was about 15 years old, encountered Judge Kavanaugh at a gathering at another teenagerâs house in Montgomery County, Md., she said. She knew him before the alleged incident, she has said, countering a theory of mistaken identity advanced by Judge Kavanaugh and his supporters in the Senate. She had met him a couple of times, though they didnât run in the same circles and werenât friends, a person close to Dr. Blasey said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss a personal matter. According to a letter sent to Senator Dianne Feinstein in July, Dr. Blasey claimed that Mr. Kavanaugh pushed her into a bedroom as she headed upstairs to a bathroom. He and someone she described as a âvery drunkenâ friend â identified in later news reports as Mr. Judge â locked the door and played loud music, she wrote. Mr. Kavanaugh then pushed her on a bed, began grinding his body against hers and tried to undress her, she said. To stifle her screams, she asserted, he covered her mouth with his hand. Mr. Judge, Dr. Blasey alleged, told his friend to alternately âgo for itâ and âstop.â When Mr. Judge jumped on the bed, causing the three teenagers to tumble onto the floor, Dr. Blasey said she ran from the room, locked herself in the bathroom and escaped after hearing the two inebriated boys stumbling down the stairs. Dr. Blasey said she did not share a detailed account of the incident with anyone until 2012, when she and her husband, Russell Ford, an engineer, met with a couples therapist, according to a Washington Post interview. In her letter to Senator Feinstein, she described being traumatized from the high school episode, saying âI have received medical treatment regarding the assault.â She declined to be interviewed for this article. Mr. Judge, now an author, filmmaker and writer for conservative publications, wrote in a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee that he had no memory of the incident, adding that he ânever saw Brett act in the manner Dr. Ford described.â Dr. Blaseyâs allegation has ignited heated controversy in Washingtonâs private school circles, reflecting the same social divisions â by gender, alma mater, class and religion â that had riven alumni as teenagers more than three decades ago. Some Georgetown Prep classmates have cast aspersions on Dr. Blasey on social media, while her allies charge hypocrisy in their overlooking a pervasive culture of misogyny that existed then. Twenty-three members of Dr. Blaseyâs class at Holton-Arms signed a joint letter sent to Congress this week, calling for âdue considerationâ of her claims. Another letter is signed by more than 1,000 alumnae, dating back to the class of 1948. When Ms. Guerry circulated the letter from the class of 1984, she found that Dr. Blaseyâs story resonated deeply. âI was very much surprised by how many of my classmates wrote back to say to say they had traumatic experiences in high school,â she said. âWhen they heard Christineâs story, it struck a chord for them.â Among them was Cheryl Amitay, a chief regulator at the Department of Veteranâs Affairs living in Washington. Ms. Amitay said she was leaving a house party during her sophomore year when two male teenagers who had been drinking pushed her up against a car and groped her. One reached under her skirt, she said, and tore off her underwear. âI will never forget that,â she said. âWhen my mom picked me up she knew something was wrong, but I didnât say anything.â âYou never say a thing,â she went on. âYou feel like a jerk.â After the alleged attack on Dr. Blasey, a male friend said, she âfell off the face of the earth socially,â failing to appear at parties and events sheâd previously attended. âAll I remember is after my junior year thinking, âWhereâs Chrissy Blasey?ââ he recalled. âShe was the sort of person a lot of people paid attention to â she was a leader, she was great. I was like, where did she go?â Dr. Blasey said the experience âderailedâ her for four or five years, and that she struggled academically and socially, according to The Washington Post. She went on to attend the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where she studied psychology. The schoolâs alumni directory and yearbook list her as having belonged to the Kappa Delta sorority, which had a reputation as the âcheerleading sororityâ in the 1980s, though she was not a cheerleader at the school. She seems to have kept a low profile. âI donât remember her very well,â said Leigh Goodwyn, who was a member of the sorority at the time. âThere are not many people in the house I can say that about.â Two other sorority sisters also had trouble remembering her. But she became close with Ms. Piwowarski. They would watch new bands perform in bars on the townâs Franklin Street, hanging out with friends, and roomed together in an off-campus apartment their senior year. After graduating from U.N.C. in 1988, Dr. Blasey moved to California, where she earned graduate degrees from Pepperdine, Stanford and the University of Southern California. When she married Mr. Ford in 2002 in Half Moon Bay, Calif., against a backdrop of redwood trees, Ms. Piwowarski was a bridesmaid. Dr. Blasey developed a passion for surfing, which she shares with her husband and two sons. âSheâs been chasing waves,â said Beth Stannard, a friend and former co-worker, who said Dr. Blaseyâs decisions to teach at Pepperdine, in Malibu, Calif., and to complete an internship at the University of Hawaii were at least partly informed by the campusesâ seaside locations. She and her family live in Palo Alto â where she has volunteered for her sonsâ schools and junior lifeguard training, has restored her midcentury modern home with an eye toward historical preservation, and has attended Stanford football and basketball games with her family. The family also has a house in Santa Cruz, famed for its beaches and breaks. âShe can be quite the academic â someone taken very seriously at a place like Stanford â and then go out and surf with the people of Santa Cruz,â Ms. Stannard said, recalling that Dr. Blasey had taken her and several colleagues surfing, followed by a lunch of fish and chips. Fellow scientists described her as a collaborative researcher and statistician, in demand among graduate students and fellow researchers who sought her more refined writing skills for reports and papers. At the University of Southern California School of Education, she worked for several years in the laboratory, where she developed a test to assess how young children cope with trauma. âShe was very meticulous with data, looked carefully at developing children,â Dr. Gayla Margolin, who led the lab, said in an interview. âIn doing good science, people have to take in information and reflect it and portray it in a very honest, straightforward way.â Dr. Blasey was hired in 2012 by Palo Alto University to teach as part of its doctoral psychology program, a consortium with Stanford that emphasizes clinical training. She is a co-author of a guide to statistical power analysis called âHow Many Subjects?â used by researchers to determine how large a sample size is required to accurately test a hypothesis. Dr. Barr Taylor, a professor emeritus of psychiatry at Stanford who for a decade chaired dissertation committees in which Dr. Blasey was involved, described her as somewhat reserved. âThe statistics fit her personality more than the statistics shaped her personality,â Dr. Taylor said. Dr. DeVarney, the Silicon Valley neuroscientist, calls Dr. Blasey âa friendly but kind of geeky scientist,â who is âobsessive about making sure itâs right.â The two worked together at three companies over 10 years. Dr. DeVarney said Dr. Blasey called her in August to say that she had sent a letter to Senator Feinstein about having been sexually assaulted in high school, âsomething that had haunted her for her entire adult life.â Dr. Blasey did not name the alleged attacker. âShe was clearly upset about it,â Dr. DeVarney recalled. âIt was creating a lot of stress for her, and now itâs taken over her life.â After Dr. Blasey decided to come forward with her allegation and notify Senator Feinstein, she, and later her lawyers, took steps to prepare for the fight of her life. She submitted to a polygraph, gathered notes from her therapist and searched her memory. âIâve been trying to forget this all my life, and now Iâm supposed to remember every little detail,â Dr. Blasey told a friend, Jim Gensheimer, in July, according to an account in The San Jose Mercury News. Later in the summer, she texted Ms. Piwowarski, her college friend. The query was worrisome, and Ms. Piwowarski told Dr. Blasey that she was there for her. It wasnât until Sunday night that Ms. Piwowarski learned the details of her friendâs account from news reports. A resident of New Bern, N.C., which was devastated by Hurricane Florence, Ms. Piwowarski said she read the story when the power came back on at her house. She felt sickened by it, she said. âSeeing what people say, I really, really understand why somebody wouldnât want to be a part of this discussion,â she said. âI think it is brave. But it is a lot to take on.â Kate Conger and Jennifer Medina contributed reporting. Kitty Bennett contributed research.     Advertisement",0.06,0.851,0.089,0.9977,0.40819377592104855

It follows an allegation of sexual assault in the 1980s against President Donald Trump's pick, Brett Kavanaugh. Mr Kavanaugh denies the allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford. Both say they are willing to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee. The panel's vote on Mr Kavanaugh is at present scheduled for Thursday. The Supreme Court often gives the final word on highly contentious laws and its nine judges have an immense impact on US political life. If chosen for the lifetime appointment, Mr Kavanaugh would be expected to tilt the court's balance to the right. Mr Kavanaugh was seen arriving at the White House on Monday morning, although the reason for the visit was unclear. President Trump told reporters at the White House on Monday: ""If it takes a little delay, it takes a little delay."" He added of Mr Kavanaugh: ""He is one of the great intellects and one of the finest people that anybody has known."" When asked whether the judge might withdraw from the confirmation process, the Republican president said: ""What a ridiculous question that is."" Calls have mounted for senators to postpone a vote on the nomination. Arizona Republican Senator Jeff Flake, who sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said Prof Ford's testimony should be heard.  ""We need to hear from her,"" he told news website Politico. ""And I don't think I'm alone in this."" Bob Corker, a Tennessee Republican, also said the vote should be delayed until Prof Ford was heard, while Lisa Murkowski told CNN a delay was something ""they might have to consider"". Without saying whether or not she would support a delay, Republican Susan Collins tweeted on Monday: ""Professor Ford and Judge Kavanaugh should both testify under oath before the Judiciary Committee."" The Republican chairman of the committee, Chuck Grassley, issued a statement without addressing any delay in the vote or testimony. He said Prof Ford ""deserves to be heard"" and that the matter should be covered in follow-up calls to both her and Mr Kavanaugh, which he said he was trying to set up. Mr Grassley criticised both the Democrats and Prof Ford's lawyer for not bringing the allegations to the committee earlier. The Democrats have demanded a delay. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said: ""Trying to rush this through on Thursday is an insult to the women of America and an insult to the majesty of the Supreme Court."" Democratic Party Senator Dick Durbin, who serves on the judiciary committee, said the burden had been put on the panel to ""get to the bottom"" of the matter. Senior Republican Senator John Cornyn called on lawmakers to treat the process ""with bipartisan participation in a spirit of collaboration and concern for all involved"". Both Prof Ford and Mr Kavanaugh said on Monday they would be willing to appear. Prof Ford's lawyer, Debra Katz, said: ""She's willing to do what she needs to do."" Ms Katz said Prof Ford had ""decided to take control of this and tell this in her own voice"". In a statement on Monday, Mr Kavanaugh again said the accusations against him were ""completely false"" and that he would ""refute"" them before the panel. He said: ""I have never done anything like what the accuser describes - to her or to anyone."" White House adviser Kellyanne Conway said Prof Ford should ""not be insulted or ignored"" and should testify under oath, although that would be up to the committee to decide. Christine Blasey Ford, a professor of psychology at Palo Alto University, detailed her allegations in the Washington Post at the weekend. She told the newspaper she believed the incident happened in 1982, when she was 15 and Mr Kavanaugh was 17.  She said Mr Kavanaugh and a friend had allegedly ""corralled"" her into a bedroom at a gathering. Mr Kavanaugh and his friend were both drunk, she says. The Washington Post reported her account as follows: ""While his friend watched, she said, Kavanaugh pinned her to a bed on her back and groped her over her clothes, grinding his body against hers and clumsily attempting to pull off her one-piece bathing suit and the clothing she wore over it.  ""When she tried to scream, she said, he put his hand over her mouth."" Mr Kavanaugh ""categorically and unequivocally"" denied the allegation last week.  Mark Judge, who has been named as the third person in the room, told The Weekly Standard the allegations were ""absolutely nuts"". Prof Ford spoke of the alleged attack a couple of times over the subsequent decades, including during therapy. Mr Trump's nomination of Mr Kavanaugh revived the pain of the memory, she said, prompting her to approach Democratic lawmakers with her allegations in July. Mr Kavanaugh, 53, was questioned during four days of hearings at the Senate Judiciary Committee last week, which are now complete.  The committee is due to vote on Thursday on whether his nomination should go forward to a full vote in the Senate.  The Republicans only have a single-vote majority on the committee, which they control 11 to 10, while they hold the Senate by just 51-49. Mr Kavanaugh is strongly opposed by some Democrats for his views on issues such as abortion, and it seems unlikely any of them will cross the aisle to vote with their Republican colleagues. This means it would take just Mr Flake to potentially derail Thursday's committee vote, while only two Republican defections would swing the outcome away from Mr Kavanaugh in the Senate. By Anthony Zurcher, BBC North America reporter This episode recalls another high-stakes confirmation battle more than 25 years ago, when then-judge Clarence Thomas faced sexual harassment allegations during his Supreme Court hearings. Mr Thomas prevailed, but the ordeal left both sides bruised and bitter, and may have contributed to the surge in women elected to Congress in 1992. Now history seemingly repeats itself, this time in the shadow of the #MeToo movement. With the disposition of the Supreme Court for a generation in the balance, and mid-term congressional elections less than two months away, the stakes couldn't be higher.

Reports say an unidentified woman claimed in a letter to Democrats that Mr Kavanaugh tried to force himself on her at a party in the early 1980s. Senate Democrats on Thursday disclosed that they had referred a complaint to federal investigators. The judge faces a confirmation vote to join the Supreme Court next week. In a statement on Friday, the appeals court judge said: ""I categorically and unequivocally deny this allegation. I did not do this back in high school or at any time."" The alleged incident took place when Mr Kavanaugh was a minor and student at Georgetown Preparatory School in Bethesda, Maryland. The woman - who asked not to be identified - was also a minor and a student at a nearby high school. Her letter alleges the now judge held her down and covered her mouth with his hand.  They were in a room with a classmate of Mr Kavanaugh's, and both boys had been drinking, before turning up the music to muffle her sound of protests, she alleges. The woman was able to free herself, the New Yorker said.  Although the alleged incident was decades ago, the woman said the memory had caused ongoing distress and she had sought psychological treatment. The woman first approached Democratic lawmakers in July, shortly after Mr Trump's nomination of him revived the pain of the memory, US media said.  She reportedly sent a letter to her local congresswoman, Democrat Anna Eshoo, and Senator Dianne Feinstein, the committee's top Democrat. Ms Feinstein said the woman ""strongly requested confidentiality, declined to come forward or press the matter further, and I have honoured that decision"".  ""I have, however, referred the matter to federal investigative authorities,"" she said Thursday. Anonymous sources, including a Democratic aide, confirmed to the Associated Press the allegation is of a sexual nature. Mr Kavanaugh is a controversial pick for replacing Justice Anthony Kennedy and he is strongly opposed by some Democrats for his views, such as on abortion. The 53-year-old was questioned during four days of hearings with the Senate Judiciary Committee last week.

Hereâs the sign-up.) Good evening. Hereâs the latest. 1. Christine Blasey Ford, who accused President Trumpâs Supreme Court nominee, Judge Brett Kavanaugh, of sexual assault, has not yet agreed to testify at a public hearing planned for Monday. The hearing, which was scheduled under pressure from lawmakers who said they wanted to hear from Dr. Blasey, promises to become a riveting public spectacle â and one with potentially grave implications for Judge Kavanaugh, who until last week was considered to be on a glide path to confirmation. For many, the case recalls the 1991 confirmation hearings for Justice Clarence Thomas, who was accused of sexual harassment by the law professor Anita Hill. In an Op-Ed today, Ms. Hill urged the Senate Judiciary Committee to learn from the experience, saying it âmust demonstrate a clear understanding that sexual violence is a social reality to which elected representatives must respond.â _____ 2. President Trump weighed in on the accusations, saying Judge Brett Kavanaugh was ânot a man that deserves this.â He falsely accused Democrats of timing the allegation to obstruct Judge Kavanaughâs confirmation. âItâs a shame,â he added, âbecause this is a great gentleman.â Separately, Mr. Trumpâs  team of lawyers is growing as the special counselâs investigation continues â but it faces a problem: Itâs still partly in the dark about Mr. Trumpâs legal exposure. _____ 3. China is running out of options in the trade war. Since President Trump initiated tariffs on billions of dollars of Chinese goods in July, Beijing has been able to put up equal trade barriers on its end, ratcheting them up in tit-for-tat moves. But this week Mr. Trump announced new tariffs on $200 billion worth of goods. Beijing could only respond with tariffs on $60 billion worth of goods â almost everything else the country buys from the U.S. Chinaâs approach has failed to thwart Mr. Trumpâs trade offensive, leaving its leaders in a bind. âThey donât know what to do,â said one analyst. _____ 4. Florence, though no longer a hurricane and moving past the Carolinas, is still trailing wreckage. Above, flooding in Lumberton, N.C. At least 34 people died as a result of the storm, and the authorities fear more deaths as floodwaters continue to rise. Record rainfall has caused dangerous flooding, and water levels are unlikely to recede for days. And flash flood advisories have been issued for cities along the stormâs northeast trajectory, including Washington, New York and Boston. _____ 5. The Diocese of Brooklyn paid $27.5 million to settle four sex abuse cases, one of the largest ever settlements obtained by victims of sex abuse within the Catholic Church. The four boys who will receive the settlement were repeatedly abused by a religion teacher at St. Lucyâs-St. Patrickâs Church, in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn. They were repeatedly raped between 2003 and 2009 when they were between the ages of 8 and 12. âThe size of the settlement has to be an indication of the severity of the abuse, and also of the pressure that the Catholic Church is under,â said Terry McKiernan, co-director and president of BishopAccountability.org, which tracks clergy sexual abuse cases. _____ 6. âThe Marvelous Mrs. Maiselâ won five Emmys on Monday night, including best comedy series, and âGame of Thronesâ picked up the award for best drama. Netflix and HBO tied with 23 Emmys each. The ceremony featured an onstage marriage proposal, bold fashion statements and an awkward musical bit about diversity. Here are the best and worst moments (including a proposal, above) and the full list of the winners. But there was a noticeable absence: any meaningful discussion of #MeToo. _____ 7. Silicon Valley is wading into the immigration debate, with companies experimenting with technology that could dissuade border crossings. Some policymakers believe the approach, using digital cameras and artificial intelligence, would be more effective than miles of concrete and metal. But many tech workers have made it clear in recent months that they donât want to work on government surveillance projects. _____ 8.

Tesla said the Justice Department had asked it for information after Elon Musk, the car companyâs chief executive, announced he was considering taking it private on Twitter. The disclosure appeared to indicate the authorities have opened an investigation into the episode. The disclosure came a day after a British cave explorer who helped rescue a Thai soccer team sued Mr. Musk for defamation. But despite these troubles, Mr. Musk named the Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa, right, as the first SpaceX passenger signed up to loop around the moon. Mr. Maezawa, founder of the Japanese online clothing company Zozo and a former rock drummer, pictured above with Mr. Musk, said he would like to take up to eight artists with him. _____ 10. Finally, we took a hard look at the reign of a creamy, herby, all-American classic. Yes, weâre talking about ranch dressing. In the 1950s, a plumber came up with the dressing mix, packaging the dry ingredients and selling them in envelopes. From there, ranch took over the nation, becoming the topping of choice for everything from chicken wings to baby carrots. (But we may have to agree to disagree about whether it belongs on pizza.)

Hereâs the sign-up.) Good evening. Hereâs the latest. 1. Rains from Hurricane Florence lashed the Carolina coast, with the storm growing in size and packing sustained winds of up to 100 miles an hour. The National Hurricane Center said the storm was likely to maintain its intensity until the eye made landfall early Friday. The storm is forecast to crawl inland, drenching a wide area with extremely heavy rains, up to 40 inches in some parts. The Times is providing unlimited access to coverage of the storm for all readers. Keep up with the latest here, and look at the full range of coverage here. In Southeast Asia, millions are bracing for Typhoon Mangkhut, a strong storm that could reach the Philippines by Friday. (Curious why Mangkhut is called a typhoon while Florence is called a hurricane? Itâs all about location.) _____ 2. President Trump falsely accused Democrats of inflating the death toll from Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico last year, rejecting the local governmentâs assessment that the storm had resulted in the deaths of nearly 3,000 people. Above, a memorial for Mariaâs victims. This week, Mr. Trump praised himself and his team for an âincredibly successfulâ job done in its response in Puerto Rico, though there is little evidence to support that claim. Separately, Mr. Trumpâs nominee for the Supreme Court, Judge Brett Kavanaugh, appeared to face some extra scrutiny after Senator Dianne Feinstein, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, referred information involving him to federal investigators on Thursday. She declined to make public what the matter, dating to his time in high school, involved. _____ 3. It was Primary Day in New York, where Gov. Andrew Cuomo easily defeated Cynthia Nixon, turning aside a challenge from the left that led to a bitterly contested race. Letitia James, the New York City public advocate, won the Democratic primary for attorney general, positioning her to become the first black woman in statewide elected office. Our Politics team has debuted a new newsletter designed to be a guiding hand to the issues and people reshaping the midterm elections. If youâre interested, you can sign up for it here. _____ 4. A major shift in whoâs coming to the U.S. The foreign-born population in the United States has reached its highest share since 1910, according to government data released Thursday, and the new arrivals are more likely to come from Asia and to have college degrees than those who came in the past. The new data comes at a time when the nationâs changing demography has become a flash point in American politics, spurred in part by President Trumpâs inflammatory rhetoric. But many assertions about a surge in Latin American immigrants did not hold up. âWe think of immigrants as being low-skilled workers from Latin America, but for recent arrivals thatâs much less the case,â the studyâs lead demographer said. _____ 5. Census Bureau figures show that the nationâs economic recovery has largely skipped over the millions of Americans living below the poverty line. Economists and advocates say that relatively modest gains that have been made over the last few years are fragile, endangered by the Trump administrationâs policies and vulnerable to a long-overdue economic downturn. âIf this is the best we can do, it isnât good,â said a poverty expert. Separately, our reporters tracked down five of the people they spoke with in the throes of the 2008 recession. Hereâs what they have to say 10 years later. _____ 6. 3,677. Thatâs how many children age 13 or younger were sexually abused by Roman Catholic clergy in Germany over the past seven decades, according to a new study. Separately, Pope Francis has ordered an investigation into allegations that a West Virginia bishop sexually harassed adults, and has accepted his resignation. An American delegation of prelates met with Francis at Vatican City to ask for an investigation into former Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, who is accused of abusing seminarians. _____ 7. And in another high-profile investigation, Robert Mueller, the special counsel investigating President Trumpâs ties to Russia, has a novel P.R. strategy: silence. Mr. Mueller has reason to be cautious, given a political climate where the subtlest remark can be blown into a scandal. Even if he were to speak publicly, his choice of news outlet and interviewer would most likely be scrutinized for signs of bias. So heâs letting his work speak for itself. And if the silent strategy is a gamble, our reporter writes, then he is all in. _____ 8. Sergei Skripal was not the only defector in Russiaâs sights. The F.B.I. was alarmed when a suspected hit man showed up years ago in Florida. Some agents voiced concern that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, a former intelligence officer known to reserve scorn for defectors from their ranks, had sent an assassin to kill one he viewed as a turncoat. Ultimately, that defector remained safe. But American intelligence officials have begun to reassess the danger facing former spies living in the U.S. after Mr. Skripal was poisoned in England in March. Above, the suspects in the Skripal poisoning. _____ 9. âA new genocide.â The fire this month that wiped out Brazilâs National Museum, home to the worldâs largest archive of indigenous Brazilian culture and history, was a huge loss to archaeologists, scholars and scientists. But it dealt a particular blow to descendants of Brazilâs oldest inhabitants, who had long fought to preserve their heritage. âThat place was like a memory, a computer hard drive, that at any moment, any ethnic group, from any people, could access to get information, to know where they were, to not feel lost,â one tribal leader said of the museum. _____ 10. Finally, it turns out humans may have been artists for longer than we thought. Archaeologists discovered a 73,000-year-old drawing, markings on the side of a stone flake, in a South African cave. It is the oldest drawing made by human hands yet found. The discovery may provide insight into the origins of humanityâs use of symbols: The nine red lines they found could reshape how we think about language, mathematics and civilization.

Hereâs what you need to know: â¢ Officials in the Philippines said today that emergency workers had recovered 43 bodies after a landslide, potentially doubling the countryâs death toll from Typhoon Mangkhut. Here are the latest updates from the storm, which continued a path of destruction through Hong Kong and southern China, where at least four people died. Using data from a NASA satellite, we looked at the typhoonâs intense rainfall in 3-D. In the U.S., the governor of North Carolina warned on Sunday that Florence, which is now a tropical depression, has ânever been more dangerous than it is right now.â At least 17 people have been killed in North and South Carolina, and a flash-flood watch is in effect for most of the area today.

How to help: Here are some of the organizations working to aid those affected by Typhoon Mangkhut and  Hurricane Florence. â¢ In an interview on Sunday, Christine Blasey Ford accused the Supreme Court nominee of sexually assaulting her when they were teenagers in the early 1980s. Ms. Ford, a research psychologist at Palo Alto University in California, said that a drunken Mr. Kavanaugh had pinned her on a bed during a party, groped her and covered her mouth to keep her from screaming. â¢ Whatâs next: Judge Kavanaugh has denied the accusations, and a Senate committee is scheduled to vote on the nomination on Thursday. The White House aide Kellyanne Conway said today that Ms. Ford âwill be heard.â â¢ A larger share of the U.S. population is foreign-born now than at any time since 1910. In recent years, the trend is not so much with Latin Americans crossing the border, but with educated people from Asia obtaining visas. Many of those immigrants came through family reunification policies that the Trump administration hopes to scale back. Some experts predict that the number of immigrants granted permanent legal residency in this fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30, will show a rare decline. â¢ Looking to 2020: Michael Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York City, is considering running for president as a Democrat. But he has sharp disagreements with the party on issues including bank regulation and stop-and-frisk police tactics. â¢ New York Cityâs efforts to pull its transit system from crisis have been hampered by ancient signaling systems, creaky trains and, increasingly, by people venturing onto the tracks.

In âNotes From a Small Island,â the best-selling author Bill Bryson wrote, âThere is no doubt in my mind that Salisbury Cathedral is the single most beautiful structure in England.â The main body of the cathedral was completed in 1258 and, as noted by one of the suspects in an interview on Russian TV, âItâs famous for its 123-meter spire.â (Thatâs equivalent to 404 feet, making it the tallest church spire in Britain.) The cathedral contains the best preserved of the four original copies of Magna Carta, the 13th-century document restricting the powers of the monarch. Itâs also the burial place of the former British prime minister Edward Heath, and is home to what is thought to be the worldâs oldest mechanical clock. The cathedral has also featured widely in literature and art, particularly in the work of the landscape painter John Constable.

By Michael Tomasky Michael Tomasky is a columnist for The Daily Beast and a contributing opinion writer. A view seems to have taken hold in Washington that the sexual assault allegations against Brett Kavanaugh by Christine Blasey Ford have let red-state Senate Democrats off the hook. These Democrats â chiefly Joe Donnelly of Indiana, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Joe Manchin of West Virginia, the three Democrats who voted to confirm Neil Gorsuch in April 2017 â all face re-election in just seven weeks in states where President Trump is popular, and where majorities presumably would support Judge Kavanaughâs elevation to the Supreme Court. But now, some say, the allegations against the nominee provide reason enough for them to vote no. Jim Manley, a former longtime Democratic Senate aide who knows these matters well, told Reuters on Tuesday: âFor those Democrats up for re-election from states that Trump carried, they now have absolutely no reason to vote for Kavanaugh. Period. End of story. They have all the cover they need.â Several talking heads on cable news said much the same thing Tuesday. Iâm not sure itâs that simple. Assuming Judge Kavanaughâs nomination is not withdrawn and the Republicans continue to fight for him, these three Democrats and possibly one or two others will still find themselves in a tough position. In fact, if a couple of Republicans defect from Judge Kavanaugh, these Democrats will be in an even tougher spot than before.  Imagine this hypothetical. Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski, the two Republican senators who are under the most pressure to oppose confirmation, decide to do so. That takes Judge Kavanaugh down to 49 votes. Game over. Except maybe not. At that point, Republicans, far from accepting defeat, will surely start aiming fire at the three Democrats. Their opponents will taunt them about Judge Kavanaugh on the campaign trail. Right-wing money will pour in to their states for pro-Kavanaugh (and pro-Trump) TV ads. Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader in the Senate, will let this play out and may schedule the vote for as late as he can â mid-October, even late October â to make the Democrats sweat. That will constitute enormous pressure on the red-state Democrats. If they sense their opponents are gaining steam, they may well think: Why should I cast a vote thatâs going to cost me my seat? Especially when even if we defeat Judge Kavanaugh, weâre just going to get someone else whoâs every bit as conservative? If one of them moves to a pro-Kavanaugh position, itâs likely that all three will move. Hereâs why. There is a standing agreement among minority parties in the Senate that in such situations, no one wants to be the 50th vote. The lone senator who provides the 50th vote can be blamed and reviled. But if all three move together, then one of them canât be singled out as having cast the dreaded 50th vote. This is one big reason there are so few 50-to-50 votes in the Senate. In fact, when one side sees it has lost, a couple other senators who can afford to cast the vote will often join in to give their colleagues cover. Beginning to see how this works? Now imagine a second scenario. Imagine that Ms. Collins and Ms. Murkowski vote no, but this time they are joined by two other Republicans, Jeff Flake of Arizona and Bob Corker of Tennessee. Now, Judge Kavanaugh is down to 47 votes. And more important, the air will be out of his balloon, emotionally. At that point, I think the three Democrats will be fully off the hook. And, of course, thereâs a third scenario (at least!), which I discussed here earlier, and itâs probably still the most likely one. All 51 Republicans stand pat, in which case some Democrats will go ahead and confirm Judge Kavanaugh. But their votes wonât matter. Whether you got 51 votes or 55 or 100, they still call you Mr. Associate Justice. If all this is maddening to you, I canât say I blame you. Why donât they just do the right thing? Well, sure. But here it gets more complicated still. Whatâs the right thing? The Democrats, say the experts, now have a chance of recapturing control of the Senate. Their candidates are looking good in Nevada and Arizona and are competitive in Tennessee and even Texas. That majority would hinge on winning three of those four seats. But it would also depend on red-state senators like Mr. Donnelly, Ms. Heitkamp and Mr. Manchin holding theirs. Voting against Judge Kavanaugh might jeopardize that. In the long run, whatâs better: the Democrats helping to confirm Judge Kavanaugh and winning a majority, or standing firm against him but remaining the minority? Many would say it doesnât have to come down to those two choices, and theyâre right. All this is unknowable. In the Democratsâ dream world, they defeat Judge Kavanaugh, win the majority, block the Republicans from getting a nominee through in the lame-duck session and then keep the seat open for two years. That could happen, too! All will hinge on a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on the sexual assault allegations, scheduled for Monday. If Ms. Blasey looks convincing, if Judge Kavanaugh looks evasive. â¦ But donât think the mere accusations doom the nominee with all Democrats. This news isnât playing in Bismarck and Charleston the way itâs playing in Washington and New York. Red-state senators probably need still a little more cover.

By Linda Greenhouse Contributing Opinion Writer  For a long time, I made it a point to write about GuantÃ¡namo at least once a year. There was usually some new development to hang a column on. But the real reason was that, having chronicled the riveting legal saga sparked by the George W. Bush administrationâs decision to create a legal black hole at the U.S. Navy base there in which to imprison hundreds of men captured in Pakistan and Afghanistan in the aftermath of 9/11, I felt an obligation to show that I was still watching, even if most people no longer were. But gradually, as President Barack Obama left office with his promise to close GuantÃ¡namo unfulfilled, and as President Trump blustered about opening the island prison to new arrivals, and as the military commission that is supposed to try the accused 9/11 perpetrators has yet to set a trial date after six years, there has seemed nothing to say. (Since his inauguration, President Trump has permitted the release of one GuantÃ¡namo detainee, leaving an inmate count of 40, down from 780 at its peak.) True, back in June, when Supreme Court Justice Anthony M. Kennedy announced his retirement, there were a few comments about his important role in the Supreme Court majority that pushed back against both the White House and Congress in a series of GuantÃ¡namo decisions more than a decade ago. But those few references were quickly buried in the avalanche of speculation on what Justice Kennedyâs departure will mean for the future of gay rights and the right to abortion. Iâm writing about GuantÃ¡namo now because of a little noticed order that came down earlier this month from the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Thatâs the court on which President Trumpâs Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, has sat for the past 12 years. The order, and the appeal that produced it, provide a bridge between past and present, between Justice Kennedy and his former law clerk who would replace him, between a battle over the rule of law now fading into history and a battle over the future of the Supreme Court that will play out when Judge Kavanaughâs Senate confirmation hearing begins next week.  The three-sentence order did not directly concern Judge Kavanaugh. He and his newest colleague on the appeals court, Gregory Katsas, âdid not participate in this matter,â a footnote informs us. The courtâs other nine judges did, and all agreed not to grant an unusual request to hear, as a full court (en banc in legal terminology), an appeal brought on behalf of a GuantÃ¡namo detainee named Khalid Ahmed Qassim. Such a request typically comes after a three-judge panel has heard an appeal, but Mr. Qassimâs lawyers sought to skip that step, deeming it futile.  Mr. Qassim, a 41-year-old Yemeni, is one of GuantÃ¡namo âforever prisoners,â having been held without charge for 16 years. He filed a habeas corpus petition in Federal District Court in Washington, D.C. in July 2004, shortly after the Supreme Court ruled in Rasul v. Bush that, contrary to the governmentâs argument, federal judges had jurisdiction to hear such cases from GuantÃ¡namo inmates. Mr. Qassimâs petition, along with others, was kept in abeyance as cases that would inevitably bear on it traveled up and down the legal system. Finally, in May, a federal district judge, Thomas F. Hogan, denied the petition in a brief oral ruling. Binding precedent of the circuit left him no choice, the judge said. âJudge Hogan was correct that panel decisions of this court prevented him from granting relief to Mr. Qassim,â the detaineeâs lawyers told the appeals courtâs judges. And here is the link to Judge Kavanaugh. The lawyers cited four D.C. Circuit decisions that they say have flouted the Supreme Courtâs holding in Boumediene v. Bush, the 2008 decision that recognized a constitutional right â not simply a statutory right, as in the earlier Rasul case â for GuantÃ¡namo inmates to seek federal court review of the legality of their detention. The four decisions, the lawyers asserted, have left Mr. Qassim and others at GuantÃ¡namo âcaught in a trap from which they cannot escape based on rules set by panels of this court that are directly contrary to the Supreme Courtâs ruling in Boumediene.â Under federal court practice, panels within an appeals court must accept each othersâ decisions as binding, unless and until the full court announces a change of course. The Qassim case will now go to an ordinary three-judge panel, which may send it back to Judge Hogan for additional fact-finding in advance of a renewed appeal. Judge Kavanaugh did not write an opinion in any of the four cases. But he was a member of the panels that decided two of them, both in 2010, by 3-to-0 votes. One, Al-Bihani v. Obama, upheld the denial of habeas corpus for Ghaleb Al-Bihani, a Yemeni who claimed that before 9/11 he was merely a cook for a group in Afghanistan allied with the Talibanâs fight against the Northern Alliance. This support for the Taliban was sufficient to justify his continued detention, the panel held in an opinion by Judge Janice Rogers Brown. Wherever the outer bounds of material support lie, Judge Brown wrote, âthey clearly include traditional food operations essential to a fighting force and the carrying of arms.â (A government review board approved Mr. Al-Bihaniâs release in 2014, and he was transferred to Oman.) The other case, Al-Adahi v. Obama, overturned a district judgeâs grant of habeas corpus to Mohammed Al-Adahi, a Yemeni who had once attended an Al Qaeda training camp and stayed at an Al Qaeda guesthouse. âIn all, there can be no doubt that Al-Adahi was more likely than not part of Al Qaeda,â Judge A. Raymond Randolph wrote for the panel. In granting Mr. Al-Adahiâs petition, the district judge had found aspects of the governmentâs evidence unreliable. But judges must view the governmentâs evidence as a whole, not piece by piece, Judge Randolph wrote, in order to see whether taken as a whole it meets the deferential standard of âmore likely than not.â The government had easily met that test in Mr. Al-Adahiâs case, Judge Randolph said.  Mr. Al-Adahi was cleared for release in 2016 and transferred to the United Arab Emirates. Judge Randolph has been openly contemptuous of the Supreme Courtâs Boumediene decision. In a speech in 2011, he compared the justices to Daisy and Tom Buchanan in The Great Gatsby, characters who âsmashed things upâ and âlet other people clean up the mess they made.â Asked in an interview for Columbia Universityâs Rule of Law Oral History Project in 2013 whether it was âfair to say that you think the Supreme Court was all wet three times runningâ â a reference to the courtâs three rounds of GuantÃ¡namo rulings that culminated in Boumediene â Judge Randolph answered âYes.â In their appeal to the full D.C. Circuit in Mr. Qassimâs case, the lawyers noted that following the Boumediene decision in 2008, district judges heard 53 habeas corpus petitions from GuantÃ¡namo detainees and granted 38 of them, a rate of 70 percent. But since the four panel rulings that purported to interpret Boumediene, ânot a single habeas petition contested by the government has been granted, and every previous district court grant of habeas appealed by the government has been reversed.â As a result, they wrote, âthese ruling have eviscerated Boumedieneâs holding that GuantÃ¡namo detainees are entitled to a âmeaningful opportunityâ to contest the basis for their detentions.â The author of the majority opinion in Boumediene was Justice Kennedy. The vote was 5 to 4, and the split was even more bitter than the vote count suggests. Justice Antonin Scalia, in a dissenting opinion that Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel A. Alito Jr. also joined, warned of âdisastrous consequencesâ from the decision and predicted that âit will almost certainly cause Americans to die.â Justice Kennedyâs majority opinion was powerful, a paean to the rule of law that echoed well beyond a particular military prison on a particular island. âWithin the Constitutionâs separation-of-powers structure,â he wrote, âfew exercises of judicial power are as legitimate or as necessary as the responsibility to hear challenges to the authority of the Executive to imprison a person.â That was especially so when detention was by executive authority rather than following a trial and conviction for a crime, he said. âIn this context the need for habeas corpus is more urgent,â he added. âThe habeas court must have sufficient authority to conduct a meaningful review of both the cause for detention and the Executiveâs power to detain.â Did these words by his old boss ring in Judge Kavanaughâs ears as he signed on to opinions that left the promise of the Boumediene decision an empty one? And if not, why not? I donât know. But I do know that GuantÃ¡namo has always been a mirror that reflects back on ourselves. And the reflection in this instance gives us another hint of what the substitution of Brett Kavanaugh for Anthony Kennedy may mean for the future of the court and the country.

Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court was thrown into uncertainty on Sunday as a woman came forward with explosive allegations that Mr. Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when they were teenagers more than three decades ago. The woman, Christine Blasey Ford, 51, a research psychologist at Palo Alto University in Northern California, said in an interview with The Washington Post that during a high school party in the early 1980s, a drunken Mr. Kavanaugh pinned her on a bed, groped her and covered her mouth to keep her from screaming. âI thought he might inadvertently kill me,â the newspaper quoted her as saying. âHe was trying to attack me and remove my clothing.â Judge Kavanaugh has denied the accusations, and in a terse statement on Sunday, the White House said it stood by those denials. It signaled that it had no intention of pulling the nomination. But Ms. Fordâs decision to put her name behind accusations that began to circulate late last week â a choice made after weeks of reluctance â appeared to open a door to a delay in a Senate committee vote on the nomination scheduled for Thursday. The disclosure also injected a volatile #MeToo element into the confirmation debate, one that is playing out in the overwhelmingly male Republican-led Senate during a midterm election that has energized Democratic women. Ms. Fordâs attorney, Debra Katz, told CNN on Monday that Ms. Ford was willing to testify before Congress, if asked. One Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, Jeff Flake of Arizona, told Politico that he was ânot comfortable voting yesâ on the nomination until he learned more about Ms. Fordâs account. A single Republican objection on the committee, which has 11 Republicans and 10 Democrats, could force a delay. Another Republican on the panel, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, said on Twitter that âif Ms. Ford wishes to provide information to the committee, I would gladly listen to what she has to say and compare that against all other information we have received about Judge Kavanaugh.â But he said he hoped to keep the process on schedule. Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, made a similar statement to Politico. Ms. Fordâs account comes as Democrats are already raising questions about Judge Kavanaughâs truthfulness during his confirmation hearings this month. They have accused him of dissembling on a range of issues from his time in the George W. Bush White House, including a breach of secret Democratic files on judicial nominations and discussions about detainee policy and torture. The new revelation prompted a hurried effort by Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the Judiciary Committee chairman, to set up conference calls to allow Democratic and Republican aides to interview both Judge Kavanaugh and Ms. Ford before Thursdayâs scheduled committee vote. A spokesman, Garrett Ventry, said it was routine to hold such calls âwhen updates are made to nomineesâ background files.â Senate Republican leaders in the hours after The Postâs article was published indicated that they intended to move forward with voting on him. Republicans planned to argue that unless corroborating information came to light, they had no way of verifying her story and saw no reason to delay the vote, according to a person involved in the discussions. The decision about any delay in the vote could rest on the opinions of two Republican women: Senators Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine. Both are publicly undecided about Judge Kavanaugh. Ms. Collins said in an interview on Sunday night that she considered the allegations serious and that Ms. Ford needed to be personally interviewed to get a fuller account. But Ms. Collins, who could conceivably decide the outcome in the narrowly divided Senate, said Democrats had done a disservice to both Ms. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh with their handling of the accusations. âWhat is puzzling to me is the Democrats, by not bringing this out earlier, after having had this information for more than six weeks, have managed to cast a cloud of doubt on both the professor and the judge,â she said. âIf they believed Professor Ford, why didnât they surface this information earlier so that he could be questioned about it? And if they didnât believe her and chose to withhold the information, why did they decide at the 11th hour to release it? It is really not fair to either of them the way it is was handled.â The White House, which has taken great pains to portray Judge Kavanaugh as a champion of women, sought to bolster him by pointing to statements by women who have known him and testified to his character. Those included a letter from 65 women who said that they knew him in high school and that he had âalways treated women with decency and respect.â Advisers to Mr. Trump were trying to avoid publicly assailing the accuser while hoping that the lack of contemporaneous corroboration for Ms. Fordâs account would mean that Senate Republicans could move ahead without addressing it in detail. More delicately, advisers were privately urging Mr. Trump, who has been accused of sexual harassment by more than a dozen women, not to speak out about the allegations against Judge Kavanaugh on Twitter for fear that he would only inflame the situation. Still, some of the presidentâs allies on the right excoriated Ms. Ford â a registered Democrat â as a partisan. But Democrats and their liberal allies rallied around her, praising her courage and deeming her allegations credible. Senator Dianne Feinstein, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, called the accusations âextremely seriousâ and said they âbear heavily on Judge Kavanaughâs character.â She urged critics of his accuser to stop âthe attacks and stop shaming her.â Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington, went one step further, invoking Anita Hill, who came forward during Justice Clarence Thomasâs 1991 confirmation hearings to accuse him of sexual harassment. âI was motivated to run for the Senate after watching the truly awful way Anita Hill was treated by an all-male Judiciary Committee interrogating her about the sexual harassment she endured at the hands of now-Justice Clarence Thomas,â Ms. Murray said in a statement, adding that the hearings must be delayed. There is an important difference between the two cases, however: Ms. Hill detailed harassment that took place in the workplace, when she and Justice Thomas were adults. The Postâs article included an interview with Ms. Fordâs husband and her lawyer, Ms. Katz, and described a therapistâs notes from 2012 in which Ms. Ford told of the attack. At Ms. Katzâs urging, Ms. Ford also underwent a polygraph examination in early August; the retired F.B.I. agent who conducted the examination, Jerry Hanafin, said in an interview on Sunday that the results showed âno deception indicatedâ â in effect, âshe was being truthful.â Her account has also been detailed in a confidential letter that Ms. Feinstein has shared with the F.B.I. She disclosed its existence on Thursday, although she had been in possession of it since late July. Most lawmakers have yet to read the letter Ms. Feinstein sent to the F.B.I., and Senate aides and lawmakers were privately weighing the implications of Ms. Fordâs interview on Sunday. Republicans on the Judiciary Committee said that if Ms. Feinstein had taken the allegations seriously, she should have brought them up earlier. âIt raises a lot of questions about Democratsâ tactics and motives to bring this to the rest of the committeeâs attention only now,â the statement said. But Ms. Katz said that throughout August, Ms. Feinsteinâs aides had checked back with Ms. Katz from time to time to see if Ms. Ford would go public. But Ms. Ford, fearing she would be attacked, wanted to remain private, and the senator respected her wishes, Ms. Katz said. She said Ms. Ford decided to reveal herself only because journalists began contacting her, and inaccurate stories about her began circulating. âWe do think that Feinstein did well by her, and we do think that people took this decision away from her, and thatâs wrong,â Ms. Katz said. âIf the #MeToo era teaches us anything, itâs that a person gets to choose when, where and how, and now this person is going to be injected into a life-altering blood bath.â The New York Times published an account of the letter on Friday. In her interview with The Post, Ms. Ford offered further detail, saying that one summer in the early 1980s, Mr. Kavanaugh and a friend, both âstumbling drunk,â led her into a bedroom at a home in Montgomery County, Md., in suburban Washington, where teenagers had gathered. The woman was wearing a bathing suit under her clothes. While his friend watched, the woman said, Mr. Kavanaugh pinned her down, grinding his body against hers and trying to pull off her one-piece bathing suit and the clothing she wore over it. She said she was able to escape when Mr. Kavanaughâs friend, Mark Judge, jumped on top of them, sending all three tumbling. She told The Post that she ran from the room, briefly locked herself in a bathroom and then fled the house. In the interview, Ms. Ford said the lasting trauma from the attack had âderailed me substantially for four or five years,â and had caused anxiety for years after that. Judge Kavanaugh, in a statement released last week, said: âI categorically and unequivocally deny this allegation. I did not do this back in high school or at any time.â In an interview with The Times on Friday, Mr. Judge, who had learned from reporters that he was the other student named in the letter, denied that any such episode had taken place. âIt never happened,â he said. âI never saw anything like what was described.â Further, he said it did not match Mr. Kavanaughâs character: âIt is not who he is.â Ms. Fordâs account opens a window into the exclusive prep school culture in which Mr. Kavanaugh grew up. The alleged assault occurred while he was a student at Georgetown Preparatory School, and Ms. Ford was a student at another private school, Holton-Arms, where she was a cheerleader in her senior year. She graduated in 1984. Reporting was contributed by Carl Hulse, Peter Baker, Nicholas Fandos, Maggie Haberman, Michael S. Schmidt, Steve Eder, Rebecca R. Ruiz and Grace Ashford.

Del Real and Inyoung Kang Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Hereâs the sign-up.) The 70th Primetime Emmys last night in Los Angeles had all the familiar trappings of Hollywood award shows: red carpet photo shoots, dramatic envelope rites, stiff banter and celebrity close-ups. In many ways, though, the show reflected the tensions and changes animating the television industry in 2018. Two running themes throughout the ceremony â prompting speculation long before the night kicked off â were the growing role streaming services have played in recent years and the intensifying push for diversity in casting and directing. This year, Netflix led the pack with 112 nominations and ended HBOâs 17-year streak as the most nominated platform. In the end, Netflix and HBO called it a tie; both came away with 23 Emmys each. HBO claimed the top prize when âGame of Thronesâ won for best drama. But it was Amazon that won for best comedy series for âThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,â one of five awards the show received at the ceremony. Notably, this year the Emmys boasted the most diverse group of nominees in its history â as those who watched the program were reminded a number of times. âYes indeedy, one step closer to a black Sheldon,â joked Kenan Thompson of âSaturday Night Live,â referring to the lead character in âThe Big Bang Theory.â Comedians and presenters throughout the evening were quick to mock premature back-patting on inclusion and sexual harassment. A whimsical but pointed musical segment opened the show: âWe solved it!â Kate McKinnon and Mr. Thompson sang. Throughout the number they were joined by Sterling K. Brown, Tituss Burgess, Kristen Bell, Ricky Martin and John Legend. (The actual point was: They have not solved it.) Amid the ceremonies, one unscripted moment nearly stole the whole show: The director Glenn Weiss â who won in the variety special category for directing last yearâs Oscars â drew stunned cheers and an outpouring on social media when he proposed to his girlfriend live on stage. She said yes. The winners in top categories: Best drama: âGame of Thronesâ (HBO) Best comedy: âThe Marvelous Mrs. Maiselâ (Amazon) Best limited series: âThe Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Storyâ (FX) Best actress, comedy: Rachel Brosnahan, âThe Marvelous Mrs. Maiselâ Best actor, comedy: Bill Hader, âBarryâ Best actress, drama: Claire Foy, âThe Crownâ Best actor, drama: Matthew Rhys, âThe Americansâ The full list of winners is here.

He unequivocally denied her years-old charges of sexual misconduct. Calls mounted to delay the vote and investigate. It was late September, and a Supreme Court seat hung in the balance. For those of a certain age in Washington, the past few days have felt like an eerie echo of the confirmation battle that consumed the capital in 1991 when Anita F. Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexually harassing her. Now it is Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh who faces a hearing on Monday to address explosive accusations by Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her when they were teenagers. While not a perfect parallel, the case has quickly polarized Judge Kavanaughâs confirmation process, once again drawing in all three branches of government for a showdown over sex, truth and politics. Justice Thomas ultimately prevailed, and has been on the Supreme Court for more than a quarter of a century. But this time the battle takes place in a different era, at a moment when the #MeToo movement has brought down many powerful men over accusations of sexual misconduct that were once swept under the rug. âI am stunned that this is happening again,â said Barbara Boxer, a former Democratic senator from California who, as a representative in 1991, was part of a group of female members of the House who marched across the Capitol plaza to demand that their own party give Ms. Hill a fair hearing. âBut it is not surprising because our culture has not completely dealt with inequality between men and women.â [Read: Why women can take years to come forward with sexual assault allegations] Washington now faces a test of what, if anything, was learned from the Thomas-Hill hearings that riveted a nation for a fall weekend almost exactly 27 years ago. Neither side emerged from that confirmation crucible happy about the process, and for some, the scar tissue remains deep. Justice Thomas and Ms. Hill both remain aggrieved a generation later, each feeling badly treated under the klieg lights. Republicans were excoriated for their cross-examination of Ms. Hill, and Democrats like Joseph R. Biden Jr., then the committee chairman, were blamed for not taking her seriously enough. Conservatives were embittered by what they considered a last-minute attack on their nominee. Many of the same dynamics are playing out in the questions raised about Judge Kavanaugh. âItâs dÃ©jÃ  vu all over again,â said Kenneth M. Duberstein, a former White House chief of staff under President Ronald Reagan who led the confirmation fight for Justice Thomas on behalf of President George Bush. But one major difference is that, this time, race is not an issue as it was with Justice Thomas, who angrily called the accusations against him âa high-tech lynching for uppity blacks who in any way deign to think for themselves.â And the proliferation of social media that did not exist in 1991 has added its own heightened effect. âWeâre seeing the same thing years later in a different modern era of communication,â said Tom Korologos, a longtime Washington lobbyist who helped Republican presidents during Supreme Court nominations, although not the battle over Justice Thomas. âA lot is going to depend on how it plays. This is too close to the election for anybody to do anything wrong and take a chance.â Ron Klain, who was the chief counsel for the Judiciary Committee Democrats at the time of the Thomas hearings, said that to avoid repeating mistakes, the panel should enlist a professional outside lawyer to question both Judge Kavanaugh and Dr. Blasey at a public hearing rather than have senators grill them. There are a few players still involved from 1991. Senators Charles E. Grassley of Iowa and Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, both Republicans, were on the Judiciary Committee then as now. Back then, Mr. Hatch said Ms. Hillâs account struck him as âtoo contrived, too slick.â On Monday, he said Dr. Blasey might be âmixed upâ and confused Judge Kavanaugh with someone else. There are some significant differences between the two situations. Justice Thomas was accused of sexually harassing Ms. Hill in the workplace but not physically assaulting her. He was a senior official at two government agencies at the time of the alleged behavior, and she was his subordinate. Judge Kavanaugh is accused of pinning Dr. Blasey to a bed, groping her, trying to remove her clothes and covering her mouth with his hand to muffle her screams while drunk at a party during high school. He was about 17 at the time, and she was about 15. Neither Ms. Hill nor Dr. Blasey reported the episodes to the authorities at the time, but what has changed since 1991 is the default setting. Whether fairly or not, the burden of proof often seemed to lie with Ms. Hill in 1991, which outraged many who believed her account. Today, in the #MeToo moment, there is more of a presumption that women who come forward with accusations should be given the benefit of the doubt, which worries Judge Kavanaughâs friends who say he may be smeared unfairly. Ms. Boxer said she thoroughly believes Dr. Blaseyâs account. âThe fact is that we know this woman is telling the truth in a case where the woman had everything to lose, tries to remain anonymous, didnât want the publicity attached to her,â she said. âWhy canât people step up after all these years?â Ms. Boxer asked. âIf we do the same thing and rush to judgment when a credible woman is putting everything on the line for truth, shame on this country. There will be reverberations.â Representative Nita M. Lowey of New York was another of the Democratic women who stormed the Senate and demanded entrance to an ongoing meeting of Democratic senators to push the cause of Ms. Hill. âOnce again you have a woman who is very credible and very serious allegations of sexual misconduct,â she said. âI would hope that men or women would listen to Dr. Fordâs accusations under oath and listen to Judge Kavanaugh under oath.â President Trump defended Judge Kavanaugh on Monday as âone of the finest people that Iâve ever knownâ who was investigated repeatedly by the F.B.I. over the years for various government positions and ânever had even a little blemish on his record.â Former Senator John C. Danforth, Republican of Missouri, who was one of Justice Thomasâs most prominent defenders, said that he sees a tragic repeat. âI just feel so terribly sorry for Kavanaugh and what heâs going through,â he said. âHereâs a man whoâs had just a marvelous reputation as a human being and now itâs just being trashed. I felt the same way about Clarence.â He added that the presumption of guilt has only grown since 1991. âWith the #MeToo movement, it makes it even harder for him,â Mr. Danforth said. âIt was bad enough for Clarence, but this is really going to be difficult.â In one way, Mr. Trump and other Republicans approached this situation differently than in 1991 â careful, at least for now, not to directly challenge Dr. Blaseyâs credibility and risk looking like they were attacking a victim of assault. Indeed, the message from Mr. Trump and congressional Republican leaders was that they wanted to hear from her, and they even agreed to a televised hearing. Instead, Republicans focused on assailing Democrats for not bringing up the issue earlier and instead injecting it into the process only days before the Judiciary Committee was scheduled to vote on Thursday. Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, complained that Democrats did not raise the matter either in closed session or in public hearings. âBut now â at the 11th hour, with committee votes on the schedule, after Democrats have spent weeks and weeks searching for any possible reason that the nomination should be delayed â now, they choose to introduce this allegation,â Mr. McConnell said. Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, who was secretly contacted by Dr. Blasey in July, said she did not tell the rest of the panel at first because Dr. Blasey insisted on maintaining confidentiality. After word of her accusations surfaced last week, Dr. Blasey agreed to be identified in an interview published in The Washington Post and now says she would testify if asked. One aspect of this fight that is strikingly different is the makeup of the Senate. During the Thomas hearings, there were only two female senators â Barbara Mikulski, Democrat of Maryland, and Nancy Kassebaum, Republican of Kansas â and neither of them belonged to the all-male Judiciary Committee. Today, the Senate has 23 women â 17 Democrats and six Republicans â and four Democratic women serve on the Judiciary Committee. The handling of the Thomas hearing, in fact, was instrumental in inspiring the so-called Year of the Woman with then-record numbers of female candidates in 1992 â including Ms. Feinstein. Female voters angered by the treatment of Ms. Hill helped defeat some Democratic senators who voted for Justice Thomas. The California seat of Ms. Boxer, who did not run for re-election in 2016, has been taken over by Kamala Harris, a Democrat and the junior member of the Judiciary Committee, who challenged multiple elements of Judge Kavanaughâs testimony during hearings at the beginning of September. Democrats controlled the Senate in 1991 when Ms. Hillâs accusations became public only two days before the floor vote, but many Southern Democrats were leery of voting against Justice Thomas, who would be only the second African-American justice to serve on the Supreme Court and had a compelling up-from-poverty life story. Nonetheless, the White House counted 77 potential votes for Justice Thomas before Ms. Hillâs accusations surfaced. He ultimately was confirmed with 52 votes. Todayâs Republicans do not enjoy nearly such a margin for error, holding just 51 seats and unable to count on Democrats to join them. Several Republicans are alienated from Mr. Trump and, unlike in 1991, the hearing will come only 43 days before an election. âSenators are nervous already,â Mr. Korologos said. âWeâre too dadgum close to an election.â Follow Peter Baker and Carl Hulse on Twitter: @peterbakernyt and @hillhulse.

Speaking through lawyers, Christine Blasey Ford said she would cooperate with the Senate Judiciary Committee and left open the possibility of testifying later about her allegations against Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh. But echoing Senate Democrats, she said an investigation should be âthe first stepâ before she is put âon national television to relive this traumatic and harrowing incident.â Republicans signaled Tuesday night that they would not negotiate an alternative date and would go ahead with the hearing without her or declare it unnecessary if she refuses to appear, then possibly move to a vote. They have repeatedly stressed that Monday would be Dr. Blaseyâs opportunity to testify, either privately or publicly, and that they planned to move forward with the confirmation process afterward. The apparent standoff was yet another turn in a high-stakes drama over the presidentâs second Supreme Court nominee that began Thursday, when the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee revealed that she had referred the sexual assault allegations to federal investigators. Dr. Blasey, a research psychologist in Northern California, has accused Judge Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her more than 30 years ago when they were teenagers at a boozy high school party, a charge that he has categorically denied. In a letter sent to the committee on Tuesday evening, Dr. Blaseyâs lawyers charged that some senators have already âmade up their minds,â but she did not explicitly reject appearing before them. In an appearance on CNN, however, one of the lawyers, Lisa J. Banks, seemed to suggest that Dr. Blasey would not show up on Monday. âSheâs not prepared to talk with them at a hearing on Monday,â Ms. Banks said. Even if Republicans agreed to an F.B.I. investigation, it would take time to complete, she added. âNo legitimate investigation is going to happen between now and Monday.â Democratic leaders quickly endorsed Dr. Blaseyâs position, but her resistance to coming to the committee on Monday seemed to harden the resolve of Republicans who said they gave her a chance to make her case. âRepublicans extended a hand in good faith,â said Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, one of the Republicans who insisted on postponing a vote until she could be heard. âIf we donât hear from both sides on Monday, letâs vote.â Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa and the Judiciary Committee chairman, said he would welcome Dr. Blasey for a staff-led interview or a private hearing, if she preferred, but made clear he was sticking with the schedule for Monday. A letter that was sent by Christine Blasey Fordâs lawyers to the Senate Judiciary Committee. âDr. Fordâs testimony would reflect her personal knowledge and memory of events,â he said in a statement. âNothing the F.B.I. or any other investigator does would have any bearing on what Dr. Ford tells the committee, so there is no reason for any further delay.â Mr. Trump joined other Republicans in rejecting an F.B.I. investigation of the long-ago episode even before Dr. Blaseyâs letter was sent on Tuesday evening. The bureau âsaid that they really donât do that, thatâs not what they do,â Mr. Trump said during a news conference. âAnd now they have done supposedly six background checks over the years as Judge Kavanaugh has gone beautifully up the ladder.â In the letter to the Judiciary Committee, Dr. Blaseyâs lawyers said that she has been the target of âvicious harassment and even death threatsâ since her name was made public on Sunday in an interview published in The Washington Post. Her email has been hacked, she has been impersonated online and she and her family have been forced to relocate out of their home, according to the lawyers, Ms. Banks and her partner, Debra S. Katz. âWhile Dr. Fordâs life was being turned upside down, you and your staff scheduled a public hearing for her to testify at the same table as Judge Kavanaugh in front of two dozen U.S. Senators on national television to relive this traumatic and harrowing incident,â the lawyers wrote to Mr. Grassley. The hearing âwould include interrogation by senators who appear to have made up their minds that she is âmistakenâ and âmixed up.ââ Dr. Blasey, who is sometimes referred to by her married name, Ford, âwants to cooperate with the committee and with law enforcement officialsâ but believes that a âfull investigationâ by the F.B.I. would be necessary to form a nonpartisan assessment before any hearing, the lawyers wrote. Both Dr. Blasey, 51, and Judge Kavanaugh, 53, had said on Monday morning that they were willing to come before the committee. In response, Mr. Grassley postponed a vote on the judgeâs confirmation and scheduled the hearing for next week. An aide to Mr. Grassley said that the committee never intended to seat the two witnesses together at one table or even on one panel. Democrats and Republicans spent much of Tuesday arguing over the scope and shape of what such a hearing would entail. Mr. Grassley told the radio host Hugh Hewitt that Judge Kavanaugh and Dr. Blasey would be the only witnesses, prompting pushback from top Democrats. Another potential witness, Mark Judge, a friend of Judge Kavanaughâs who Dr. Blasey said was in the room when the assault occurred, told the Judiciary Committee he does not remember it. âI never saw Brett act in the manner Dr. Ford describes,â he said in a statement sent by his lawyers, adding that âI do not wish to speak publiclyâ about the matter. As senators in both parties grappled with how to move forward, Mr. Trumpâs advisers and Judge Kavanaughâs allies appeared to be settling on a strategy of defending him by suggesting that this must be a case of mistaken identity. Under the emerging strategy, Judge Kavanaughâs defenders would accept that Dr. Blasey was in fact assaulted but would insist that it must have been by someone other than Judge Kavanaugh because he denied it. The approach reflects the shifting reality of the #MeToo movement when it has become politically perilous to directly attack the credibility of women who come forward to tell their stories. By suggesting that perhaps there was confusion after more than 30 years, White House allies said that they could offer wavering Republicans whose votes are critical for his confirmation another explanation for the he-said-she-said conflict without tearing down Dr. Blasey. The line of defense seemed to be previewed on Monday when Judge Kavanaugh called Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah and a member of the Judiciary Committee, to discuss the allegations. Mr. Hatch told reporters afterward that he believed Judge Kavanaugh. âI think sheâs mistaken somethingâ or is âmixed up,â he said. Two people familiar with the call, who did not want to be identified discussing it, said the judge insisted to Mr. Hatch that he did not do what he was accused of and then, in response to a question, agreed it was possible Dr. Blasey was thinking of somebody else. Dr. Blasey has been uncertain about some details of the episode, including when it happened and whose house they were at. But this strategy carries its own risks. The letter from Dr. Blaseyâs lawyers strongly suggested that it would be offensive to assert that she would not remember who pinned her down to a bed, groped her, tried to take her clothing off and covered her mouth to keep her from screaming at that party in the 1980s. Judge Kavanaugh has told associates that he did not know who his accuser was until she identified herself in The Post and that, once he saw her name, he vaguely recalled her being part of the social circle associated with his all-boys high school in suburban Maryland at the time. A person close to Dr. Blasey, who asked not to be identified to discuss the situation in detail, said Dr. Blasey knew the future Judge Kavanaugh in passing before the gathering where she says the attack took place, which could make it harder for his defenders to make a case that she had confused him for someone else. The conflicting stories generated political fireworks in Washington on Tuesday. Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, posted on Twitter a video clip of Judge Kavanaugh speaking at his alma mater, Georgetown Preparatory School, in 2015. âWhat happens at Georgetown Prep stays at Georgetown Prep,â he said to laughter. âThatâs been a good thing for all of us, I think.â Ms. Warren added: âI canât imagine any parent accepting this view. Is this really what America wants in its next Supreme Court Justice?â For their part, the White House and other Republicans seized on comments Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, made to Fox News. âI canât say everythingâs truthful,â she said of Dr. Blaseyâs account. âI donât know.â The White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, cited that and added, âNow clear why top Democrat on Senate Judiciary Committee did nothing with allegation for months or even ask Judge Kavanaugh about it.â Ms. Feinstein later clarified on Twitter: âDuring every step of this process, Iâve found every single piece of information from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford eminently credible, sincere and believable.â Dr. Blaseyâs allegations are inevitably evoking comparisons to 1991 confirmation hearings of Clarence Thomas, who was accused of sexual harassment by the law professor Anita F. Hill. The sight of Professor Hill being grilled on national television by an all-white, all-male Judiciary Committee enraged women, contributing to the so-called Year of the Woman in 1992, when scores of women ran for public office. Republicans, clearly hoping to avoid a repeat of the Hill-Thomas scenario, were considering employing a special counsel or staff member to question Dr. Blasey and Judge Kavanaugh. Democrats accused Republicans of trying to rush through a hearing without a proper investigation of serious charges. âShe is under no obligation to participate in the Republican efforts to sweep the whole thing under the rug, to continue this nomination on a fast track,â said Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington, who won her Senate seat in 1992. âItâs basically a railroad job. This is what they did to Anita Hill.â But while Republicans hoped to avoid appearing to aggressively attack Dr. Blaseyâs credibility, they made clear on Tuesday that they will vigorously defend Judge Kavanaugh, who until last week seemed on a glide path to confirmation. Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the chamberâs No. 2 Republican, called Dr. Blaseyâs accusations âa drive-by attack on the character of this judge,â and referred to them as âfalse allegations,â in remarks on the Senate floor. Uncharacteristically, the combative Mr. Trump on Tuesday stuck to the strategy of not attacking the accuser directly as well, instead expressing sympathy and faith in Judge Kavanaugh while assailing Democrats for trying to torpedo his nominee. âI feel so badly for him that heâs going through this, to be honest with you,â Mr. Trump said of the judge. âI feel so badly for him. This is not a man that deserves this.â The president repeated the attack on Ms. Feinstein for not raising the issue earlier in the confirmation process, given that Dr. Blasey first contacted her in July. âWhy didnât the Democrats bring it up then?â he said. âBecause they obstruct and because they resist. Thatâs the name of their campaign against me.â For some liberals, the charge of obstructionism rang hollow given that Republicans refused to even meet with President Barack Obamaâs Supreme Court nominee Merrick B. Garland in 2016. In this case, Ms. Feinstein said she did not raise the issue earlier because Dr. Blasey requested confidentiality. Only after word of the accusations leaked out last week did Dr. Blasey shift gears and agree to be named publicly. Professor Hill, in an opinion article published Tuesday in The New York Times, warned senators against repeating her experience in 1991. âThat the Senate Judiciary Committee still lacks a protocol for vetting sexual harassment and assault claims that surface during a confirmation hearing,â she wrote, âsuggests that the committee has learned little from the Thomas hearing, much less the more recent #MeToo movement.â An earlier version of this article misstated what Mark Judge told the Senate Judiciary Committee. He said that he does not remember the episode, not that he does.     Advertisement",0.094,0.837,0.068,-0.9963,0.426409110766909

Kavanaugh hasnât just upended what was expected to be his relatively easy Senate confirmation to the Supreme Court. The allegation has also scrambled the political calculations for 10 Democratic senators running for re-election in states won by President Trump, particularly three moderate Democrats who had been weighing a yes vote. Few politicians have a greater stake in Judge Kavanaughâs fate than these 10 senators who are trying to appeal to red-state voters back home, and whose re-election bids will determine whether Democrats win control of the narrowly divided chamber in November. Before Christine Blasey Ford accused Judge Kavanaugh of assaulting her when they were teenagers, many of these senators were simply happy that the Kavanaugh nomination hadnât become a rallying cry for the conservative base. They hoped they could vote no without political consequences, because he was so likely to be confirmed with Republican votes, and then move on to more favorable terrain. And for three of the most moderate Senate Democrats â Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Joe Manchin III of West Virginia and Joe Donnelly of Indiana â the nomination represented an opportunity for them to vote yes on Judge Kavanaugh and demonstrate independence from their party and deny Republicans an issue in the fall campaign. The three had previously supported President Trumpâs first nominee for the court, Justice Neil M. Gorsuch. But Dr. Blaseyâs accusation is now leading Senate Democrats to assess whether she has given them an easy pass to vote no on his nomination â or if they could face controversy over a 36-year-old allegation that they would rather not deal with in the midterm campaign. [Make sense of the people, issues and ideas shaping the 2018 elections with our new politics newsletter.] The political risks and opportunities for Democrats â and for the partyâs Senate candidates in competitive races in Arizona, Nevada, Tennessee and Texas â may not be clear until after Judge Kavanaugh and Dr. Blasey testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee. He is scheduled to do so on Monday; she has been invited to, but has called for an F.B.I. investigation of her allegation first. Yet there is rising confidence among many leading Democrats that, at the very least, the claim of sexual misconduct deprives Republicans of a potent issue to wield against senators who vote no. Any Republican attacks over Judge Kavanaugh in a campaign-season debate, for example, could be met with a rejoinder about the assault allegation. âThis certainly changes the dynamic a lot,â said Senator Doug Jones, Democrat of Alabama, who himself will face a difficult re-election in 2020. âWhen allegations like this are raised, even with the timing, it changes the dynamic.â Mr. Jones said that if he determines Dr. Blaseyâs story is true, he âwould not support his nomination.â But in an illustration of how cautiously other red-state Democrats are still treading, Senator Manchin of West Virginia would not offer a similar vow, saying he didnât want to speculate on what he may do. âEverything should be taken serious and we should let the process continue,â he said in a brief interview. Republicans close to Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican majority leader, say he will not back off his commitment to Judge Kavanaugh, in part because he believes the timing of the accusation is suspicious but also because he believes yanking the nomination would depress his partyâs base in the midterms. But Republicans acknowledge that, in pushing Judge Kavanaugh forward, they will only further imperil their House majority, which depends in part on a series of suburban districts filled with voters already enraged about Mr. Trumpâs treatment of women. For their part, many Senate Democrats are hoping that Judge Kavanaughâs nomination is ultimately torpedoed by Republicans, who have a 51-to-49 majority in the Senate. Three key Republican senators â Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Susan Collins of Maine and Jeff Flake of Arizona â have expressed concerns about moving ahead with a vote on Judge Kavanaugh without hearing from Dr. Blasey. If they were to band together to oppose his nomination, it could seal Judge Kavanaughâs fate and force Mr. Trump to withdraw his pick â and all without Democrats having to step into the fray. (Such a scenario appeared more remote after Dr. Blaseyâs lawyer indicated she would not testify until the F.B.I. investigates, however.) Of the potential scenarios involving the outcome for Judge Kavanaughâs nomination, strategists in both parties agree that his withdrawal would be most politically damaging to Republicans. It would underscore the chaos surrounding Mr. Trump; amount to an acknowledgment that Mr. Kavanaugh is tarnished; and, by bowing to liberals demanding he not be confirmed, infuriate the conservative rank-and-file. [[Read what Judge Kavanaughâs and Dr. Blaseyâs supporters are saying about her accusations against him.]] Democrats may not want him on the bench for a host of reasons, but Judge Kavanaugh narrowly winning confirmation would be politically tolerable to many of them, strategists say. Republicans may still target those Democrats who opposed him, but their attacks would be clouded by the assault allegation. Where the two parties differ is on the possibility that the Kavanaugh nomination is brought to a vote and defeated. Democrats fear that would enrage Mr. Trump and his supporters, prompting them to show up at the polls to take out their anger on the opposition. But Republicans worry any failure to confirm him will demoralize their base. More broadly for Democrats, though, is the question of just how much risk still remains with the vote. Some in the party believe that Judge Kavanaugh is now tainted and that the charges have effectively freed red-state Democrats to oppose him. âI think itâs an easy vote now,â said Kip Tew, a former Indiana Democratic chairman, adding that grass-roots activists would have a far more difficult time stomaching a âyesâ vote from their senator in light of the claim of sexual misconduct. âI just donât see how he can go to the base of the Democratic Party and vote yes given these revelations.â Hoping to galvanize Democratic senators, a liberal group opposed to Judge Kavanaughâs nomination released a commercial Tuesday linking together Mr. Trumpâs infamous comments on âAccess Hollywoodâ; his support for Roy Moore, the Alabama Senate candidate accused of preying on teenage girls; and the accusation against Mr. Kavanaugh. âWe canât let Brett Kavanaugh decide on our rights for a generation,â says the announcer in the ad produced by the group, Demand Justice. âEnough is enough.â If the moderate Democrats do oppose Judge Kavanaugh, they will most likely not only cite Dr. Blaseyâs story but also point to his views on the Affordable Care Act â an issue many of them have already homed in on during the campaign. Senator Mazie Hirono of Hawaii, a progressive who has been an outspoken supporter of Dr. Blasey, said there was any number of reasons her red-state colleagues could oppose Mr. Kavanaugh. And she sought to assure them that, because of the allegation, they could safely adjust their calculus on Mr. Kavanaugh. âWeâre in a different kind of environment now,â said Ms. Hirono, pointing to the fury of many women in the #MeToo and Trump era. Yet there are some Democrats who are uneasy about the bulk of October being spent on the fate of Mr. Trumpâs Supreme Court pick rather than on less polarizing matters. âThis close to an election, having an issue this significant out there, itâs not helpful at all to somebody running in a red state,â said Byron Dorgan, a former Democratic senator from North Dakota. And with Mr. Trump effectively unable to campaign in many competitive House districts because he is too unpopular, red-state Senate Democrats have little appetite to see him repeatedly return to their states in the last stages of the election as part of a Kavanaugh-driven revenge mission. âItâs not easy,â said Natalie Tennant, a Democrat and former West Virginia secretary of state who ran for the Senate there in 2014. Referring to Senator Manchin, she said: âIf he votes no, people will think heâs against Trump. If he votes yes, theyâll think heâs for Trump. Ultimately, he has to be for West Virginia.â And what that means when it comes to Judge Kavanaugh is now a lot less clear.

Christine Blasey Ford's attorney told CNN her client has been ""deflecting death threats and harassment"". Lawyer Lisa Banks said before her client goes to Congress, she wants an FBI investigation into Judge Kavanaugh. The nominee, who denies the claim, has met officials at the White House for a second day. Prof Ford, a psychology lecturer in California, has accused Judge Kavanaugh of drunkenly trying to remove her clothing in 1982 when they were both teenagers in a Washington DC suburb.  She says he pinned her to a bed and clamped his hand over her mouth when she attempted to scream. Judge Kavanaugh, 53, has called the allegation ""completely false"". Prof Ford's legal team say they have written to the Senate Judiciary Committee declining its offer to testify. Her lawyer told CNN on Tuesday night: ""It's premature to talk about a hearing on Monday because she [Prof Ford] has been dealing with the threats, the harassment and the safety of her family and that's what she's been focused on for the last couple of days."" She said that since going public with her allegation in the Washington Post on Sunday, Prof Ford has been trying to work out where her family are going to sleep at night. The legal team's letter says that Prof Ford's family has been forced to move out of their home, her email has been hacked and she has been impersonated online. The correspondence says ""a full investigation by law enforcement officials will ensure that the crucial facts and witnesses in this matter are assessed in a non-partisan manner, and that the Committee is fully informed before conducting any hearing or making any decisions"". Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley later said that there was no reason to delay Prof Ford's testimony as the aim would be to establish ""her personal knowledge and memory of events"". ""Nothing the FBI or any other investigator does would have any bearing on what Dr Ford tells the committee,"" he said in a statement. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, of South Carolina, said that if Prof Ford did not appear to testify on Monday, ""we are going to move on and vote [on the nominee for the Supreme Court] on Wednesday"". ""They've had tons of time to do this,"" he said, adding: ""This has been a drive-by shooting when it comes to Kavanaugh, I'll listen to the lady, but we're going to bring this to a close."" Senator Rob Portman, a Republican from Ohio, said the process was ""very unfair"" and that he did not blame Prof Ford, instead blaming ""Democrats who misused this process"".  Chuck Schumer, the top Senate Democrat, said he supported the call for an FBI investigation prior to the hearing.  In a statement he urged Senate Republicans and the White House to ""drop their inexplicable opposition"" to it and ""allow all facts to come out"".  Hawaii Democrat Mazie Hirono said ""the men in this country"" should ""just shut up"".  ""Not only do women like Dr Ford, who bravely comes forward, need to be heard, but they need to be believed,"" she told a press conference. Separately, the FBI declined to comment after the letter was made public on Tuesday. US President Donald Trump, who reportedly did not meet Mr Kavanaugh on Tuesday, expressed sympathy for his nominee. ""I feel so badly for him that he's going through this, to be honest with you,"" the Republican president told a news conference. ""This is not a man that deserves this."" He added: ""Hopefully the woman will come forward, state her case. He will state his case before representatives of the United States Senate. And then they will vote."" Mr Trump also appeared to suggest that the controversy was being exploited by Democrats as lawmakers looked to delay the Supreme Court vote.  ""The Supreme Court is one of the main reasons I got elected President. I hope Republican voters, and others, are watching, and studying, the Democrats Playbook,"" he tweeted. Meanwhile Mark Judge, a friend of Judge Kavanaugh who Prof Ford says witnessed the alleged incident, has said he does not want to speak publicly about the matter. ""Brett Kavanaugh and I were friends in high school but I do not recall the party described in Dr Ford's letter,"" he is quoted as saying in a letter from his lawyer. Republicans control the Senate by only a narrow 51-49 margin, meaning any defections could scupper the Supreme Court nomination. That would set back President Trump's efforts to install more conservatives on the Supreme Court and broader US judiciary. If confirmed, Judge Kavanaugh, a conservative federal appeals court judge, would be expected to tilt the court's balance further to the right. The ugly confirmation battle could shake up the forthcoming mid-term elections. Democrats are hoping to wrest control of Congress from Mr Trump's fellow Republicans on 6 November, dealing a serious blow to the president's efforts to install more conservatives on the Supreme Court and broader US judiciary. Theresa May says it is ""not acceptable"" for EU leaders to reject her plan without an alternative.

Kavanaugh and his accuser devolved into a polarizing stalemate on Wednesday as Democrats and Republicans advanced competing narratives to convince voters that the other side has been unfair in the Supreme Court confirmation battle. Christine Blasey Ford, the professor who alleged that Judge Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when they were teenagers, said a Senate hearing set for Monday to hear her allegation would not be fair and Democrats insisted that an F.B.I. investigation take place first. Backed by President Trump, Senate Republicans rejected any F.B.I. inquiry, and said that Monday was her chance to be heard. Dr. Blaseyâs resistance to appearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Monday seemed to galvanize Republicans and drew wavering Republican senators back into Judge Kavanaughâs camp. Barring new information or an agreement by Dr. Blasey to testify after all, Judge Kavanaugh may now have enough momentum to be confirmed as early as next week. Republicans set a committee meeting for Wednesday for a possible vote to move the nomination to the floor. [Read how Dr. Blasey went from the anonymity of academia to the center of a Supreme Court confirmation.] Hanging over the impasse were the midterm elections, now less than seven weeks away. Republicans were determined to confirm Judge Kavanaugh before then, knowing that if Democrats managed to win control of the Senate, it would be exponentially harder to approve any nominees sent by Mr. Trump. Conversely, for Democrats, a delay in voting on Judge Kavanaugh would increase the chances of blocking his confirmation and enhance the influence Democrats would have over who eventually fills the vacant seat. In a statement, Lisa J. Banks, a lawyer for Dr. Blasey, said on Wednesday that her client was still willing to work with the Judiciary Committee, but was not convinced that a hearing featuring just her and Judge Kavanaugh would be adequate. âThe committeeâs stated plan to move forward with a hearing that has only two witnesses is not a fair or good faith investigation; there are multiple witnesses whose names have appeared publicly and should be included in any proceeding,â Ms. Banks said. âThe rush to a hearing is unnecessary, and contrary to the committee discovering the truth.â Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa and the committee chairman, said he was flexible on how to handle the questioning of Dr. Blasey but not on the date. He offered to hold a public hearing or to conduct the interview behind closed doors, whichever she preferred. He said she could be questioned by staff members rather than senators, and that he would even send lawyers to California to interview her, if she liked. But he rejected Dr. Blaseyâs request that the F.B.I. investigate her charges before any hearing and made clear that he would not postpone it past Monday. âIt would be a disservice to Dr. Ford, Judge Kavanaugh, this committee and the American people to delay this hearing any further,â he wrote in a letter to committee Democrats. [Read what Judge Kavanaughâs and Dr. Blaseyâs supporters are saying about her accusations against him.] The mood at the White House improved on Wednesday, and Mr. Trump referred to Judge Kavanaugh as âJustice Kavanaughâ three times during a seven-minute exchange with reporters. He again avoided directly attacking Dr. Blasey, but said he found her charges hard to believe. âI think itâs a very unfair thing whatâs going on,â the president said. Still, he seemed to leave open the possibility that he might have to find another nominee if Dr. Blasey proved persuasive. âLook, if she shows up and makes a credible showing, that will be very interesting and weâll have to make a decision,â Mr. Trump said. âBut I can only say this: He is such an outstanding man. Very hard for me to imagine that anything happened.â Democrats acknowledged that Republicans seemed to have reassured the members of their conference uneasy over the allegation and could confirm Judge Kavanaugh on the strength of their razor-thin 51-to-49 majority. âClearly, the Senate Republicans have decided to tough it out, and they are worried about one constituency at this point,â Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, said in an interview. âIt is not the American public; it is the six or seven Senate Republicans who objected last week to a hurry-up hearing. They think they have them back in their corner.â Still, the emergence of Dr. Blaseyâs allegation may have cost Republicans the chance of winning support from any of the red-state Democrats they were hoping to enlist. Senator Claire McCaskill, a Democrat facing a competitive re-election in Missouri, announced Wednesday that she will vote against confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh. Ms. McCaskill said she was concerned about the accusation against the judge, but based her decision on campaign finance law. âHe has revealed his bias against limits on campaign donations, which places him completely out of the mainstream of this nation,â she said in a statement. Dr. Blasey, 51, a university professor in Northern California who is also known by her married name, Ford, has accused Judge Kavanaugh, 53, of pinning her to a bed, groping her, trying to remove her clothing and covering her mouth to keep her from screaming during a party in the early 1980s when the two were teenagers in Maryland. Judge Kavanaugh has categorically denied the allegation, and the only other person Dr. Blasey said was in the room has also said he does not remember such an assault and had never seen Judge Kavanaugh behave that way. Another high school friend, Patrick J. Smyth, came forward on Wednesday, saying he was one of two other people Dr. Blasey identified being elsewhere in the house at the time of the alleged assault. In a letter to the Judiciary Committee, Mr. Smyth said he did not remember anything like it. âI have no knowledge of the party in question; nor do I have any knowledge of the allegations of improper conduct she has leveled against Brett Kavanaugh,â he wrote. He added, âI have never witnessed any improper conduct by Brett Kavanaugh towards women.â With the conflict over the confirmation and the supercharged allegations taking place so close to the midterms, both sides were deeply anxious about the possible effect and were eager to blame the other. Republicans argued that they have given Dr. Blasey an opportunity to tell her story to the Senate, either in public or in private, while Democrats said the refusal to call in the F.B.I. showed that the presidentâs party was not really interested in finding the truth. âThis process has been off the rails for a long time now, but the last 24 hours signal a new low,â said Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island. He noted that Dr. Blasey has been harassed and forced to leave her own home since bringing her account to the public. âIn the face of this, Republicans are jamming her into a âtake it or leave itâ kangaroo hearing without even the courtesy of proper investigation of her claims. It is a disgrace.â Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican committee member from South Carolina and ally of the presidentâs who traveled with him on Wednesday to view hurricane damage, said that requiring an F.B.I. investigation before a hearing would not be âabout finding the truth but delaying the process until after the midterm elections,â when Democrats hope to win control of the Senate. âIt is imperative the Judiciary Committee move forward on the Kavanaugh nomination and a committee vote be taken as soon as possible,â Mr. Graham said in a statement. For many Democrats, the insistence on quick action and the charge of obstructionism rang hollow given that Republicans refused to even meet with President Barack Obamaâs Supreme Court nominee, Judge Merrick B. Garland, in 2016. Judge Garland never received a hearing, and the vacant seat resulting from the death of Justice Antonin Scalia was eventually filled by Mr. Trumpâs first Supreme Court choice, Neil M. Gorsuch. Three of the Republican senators who had insisted on postponing a committee vote on Judge Kavanaugh originally scheduled for Thursday until hearing from Dr. Blasey have now said she should testify on Monday. âI donât think she can reject all those options because otherwise there are these very serious allegations hanging over the head of a nominee who has emphatically denied them,â Senator Susan Collins told a radio station in her home state, Maine, on Wednesday. âThatâs just not a good way for us to end. So I think she needs to come forward, and we need to provide her with any protection she may ask for herself and her family.â Ms. Collins noted that Dr. Blasey had secured the services of lawyers and should be prepared for testifying. âThereâs more than a week between when she made the allegations and the date of the hearing,â she said. âI just donât understand why the hearing shouldnât go forth.â Following the advice of aides, Mr. Trump refrained from any inflammatory comments about the court fight. âIf she shows up, that would be wonderful,â he told reporters before leaving for North Carolina. âIf she doesnât show up, that would be unfortunate.â âIâd really want to see her,â the president said. âI really would want to see what she has to say.â The allegations against Judge Kavanaugh appeared to diminish his public standing, according to a new Reuters/Ipsos poll. Opposition to his confirmation rose by six percentage points to 36 percent in a survey that began before Dr. Blasey went public and continued through Monday after The Post article. Only 31 percent said they support his confirmation, which would rank him among the lowest nominees if he were eventually confirmed. While Dr. Blasey and Democrats have called for an F.B.I. investigation before a hearing, it is unlikely the bureau would open a criminal investigation of Judge Kavanaugh because Dr. Blaseyâs accusations do not involve a potential federal crime. Sexual assault would typically be a state crime, and the passage of more than three decades would make any prosecution problematic, according to legal experts. Democrats pointed out on Wednesday that the F.B.I. was asked to investigate Anita F. Hillâs sexual harassment claims against Clarence Thomas when he was nominated for the Supreme Court in 1991. But Mr. Grassley said that happened when Ms. Hillâs allegations were still confidential and pointed out that she testified at a hearing only five days after her charges became public, much as Dr. Blasey is being asked to do. The F.B.I. does conduct background checks on Supreme Court nominees and passes along information to officials running the confirmation process, but it does not make judgments on the credibility of the claims, according to Justice Department guidelines. âThe F.B.I.âs role in such matters is to provide information for the use of the decision makers,â according to background check guidelines issued in 2010 during the Obama administration. While the F.B.I. should âapprise the president or his designated representativeâ when new information surfaces that raises questions about the suitability of an appointee, âthe F.B.I. does not make any judgment about the credibility or significance of any allegation.â Katie Benner and Catie Edmondson contributed reporting.

 Brett Kavanaugh, Donald Trumpâs conservative nominee for the US supreme court, faced sharp questions on Capitol Hill on some of the hottest issues raging in American society â abortion, gun rights and presidential power â during the second day of his dramatic confirmation hearing. Amid hours of intense questioning on Wednesday, Kavanaugh declined to say how he would rule if the supreme court were to once again weigh the legality of abortion and similarly dodged on whether the president has the authority to pardon himself. The atmosphere was a little calmer, after the opening day on Tuesday quickly became a cacophony of yelling protesters incensed at the choice of Kavanaugh and repeated interruptions by Democratic senators angry at the late disclosure of documents by the White House about the judgeâs track record. But demonstrations continued inside the US Senate building on Wednesday, with occasional outbursts from protesters, such as: âSham president, sham justice!â and âNo Trump puppet!â As members of Congress weighed his suitability for Americaâs top judicial bench, Kavanaugh said he understood âthe significanceâ of Roe v Wade, the landmark 1973 supreme court decision that legalized abortion in the US. But he declined to respond when asked if he would make a commitment against overturning the law. He also successfully dodged the question of whether a president must respond to a subpoena â neatly sidestepping an intensely contested topic against the backdrop of special counsel Robert Muellerâs investigation into potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Moscow. The wide-ranging testimony underscored the potential for Kavanaughâs nomination to shape the supreme court and the decisions before it for decades to come. Kavanaugh, a federal appeals judge, was nominated by Trump in July to replace the retiring justice Anthony Kennedy, who had been a critical swing vote on the nine-member bench. Kennedy had a track record of siding with the more liberal justices on the bench on some decisions, the more conservative wing on others. Kavanaugh is expected to push the court to the right. On Wednesday, members of the Senate committee were granted up to 30 minutes each to grill Kavanaugh on a variety of subjects. But he remained vague on what his approach would be to several issues at the forefront of his nomination. Chief among them was his views on abortion amid concerns that Kavanaughâs confirmation will all but ensure an end to legal abortion across the US, long a goal of ultra-conservatives. But in the hearing Kavanaugh mostly stuck to reciting the facts of the case without disclosing his own legal view. âI understand the importance of the precedent set forth in Roe v Wade,â he said. âIt has been reaffirmed many times over the past 45 years.â Asked directly by Dianne Feinstein, the Democratic senator from California, for his position on a womanâs right to choose, Kavanaugh again cited legal precedent, while adding: âI understand how passionately and deeply people feel about the issue. I donât live in a bubble. I live in the real world.â Kavanaughâs comments will do little to pacify skeptics, who have cited his opposition to a court ruling last year that an undocumented immigrant teenager who was in government custody was entitled to seek an abortion. Pressed on the case in Wednesdayâs hearing, Kavanaugh said he was following his interpretation of parental consent provisions in the law. (The teen followed state law, obtaining permission to seek an abortion from a judge in the absence of parental consent.) ""I'm a judge, I'm not making the policy decision,â Kavanaugh said. On Twitter, Hillary Clinton urged her followers to join the pressure campaign against Kavanaugh by calling their senators. âIf Brett Kavanaugh becomes a supreme court justice, will he help gut or overturn Roe v Wade, which legalized abortion in America? Yes, of course he will,â the former presidential nominee tweeted. In another consequential exchange, Kavanaugh would not say if a president was legally obligated to comply with a subpoena. âI canât give you an answer on that hypothetical question,â he said. The question, posed by Feinstein, was an unmistakable reference to the legal challenges facing Trump. The presidentâs repeated efforts to undermine the Russia investigation â and threats to dismiss the special counsel â have amplified the potential for the matter to eventually reach the courts. Senator Patrick Leahy, a Democrat from Vermont, asked Kavanaugh point blank if presidents have the âabsolute rightâ to pardon themselves. The judge once again demurred. âThe question of self-pardons is something I've never analyzed,â Kavanaugh said. âIt's a hypothetical question that I can't begin to answer in this context.â Kavanaugh also described US v Nixon, the supreme court ruling that ordered then President Richard Nixon to turn over secret White House recordings toward the end of the Watergate investigation, as âone of the greatest moments in American judicial historyâ. He had previously signaled it may have been wrongly decided. Democrats have raised concerns that if the special counsel investigation were to make its way to the supreme court, Kavanaugh could not be impartial toward the president who appointed him. Kavanaugh insisted the White House was subject to the law, but left Democrats on the panel frustrated over his refusal to say where, exactly, the presidentâs authority might be limited. Kavanaugh would not comment on whether a president could fire the special counsel investigating him and said it was up to Congress to determine what would constitute an impeachable offense. He did, however, push back on the notion that he would be loyal to Trump. ""If confirmed to the Supreme Court and as a sitting judge, I owe my loyalty to the Constitution,"" Kavanaugh said, while holding up a personal copy of the legal document. The Republicans have a razor-thin majority in the Senate but are nevertheless expected to have the votes to confirm Kavanaugh before the midterm elections in November. The confirmation hearing for Donald Trump's pick for the supreme court has been a tumultuous affair",0.038,0.846,0.115,0.9976,0.42055555555555546

Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when they were teenagers while he was drunk have drawn attention to a speech he gave four years ago in which he discussed heavy drinking at Yale Law School â and to an offhand remark about his high school days that he made during another speech. Earlier this week, a transcript of a 2014 speech Judge Kavanaugh apparently gave at a banquet for the Yale Law School Federalist Society surfaced via a Washington Post reporter on Twitter; some of it was later transcribed and posted by the magazine Mother Jones. The speech, in which he imparted lessons to students and reminisced about his time at school, contained one section in which Judge Kavanaugh, now 53, fondly recalled some debaucherous â if seemingly harmless â nights of heavy drinking and revelry as a Yale Law student. In one episode, he described taking a bus with his classmates to Boston for a Red Sox game and a night of barhopping, which ended with the students âfalling out of the bus onto the front steps of Yale Law School at about 4:45 a.m.â âFortunately for all of us, we had a motto: âWhat happens on the bus stays on the bus,ââ the speech said. Judge Kavanaugh then went on to describe a âgood runâ in his third year of law school, in which he and his classmates âgot our work done, but we had our share of fun.â He discussed a class party and mentioned a nearby bar, which he summarized by saying: âWe had a memorable evening. It is fair to say that we had a few drinks. Indeed, as a classmate of mine and I were reminiscing and piecing things together the other day, we think we had more than a few beers before the banquet. Might have been at Toadâs. Not a good idea.â Then, on Tuesday, an apparently truncated video clip of Judge Kavanaugh giving another speech emerged. Referring to his high school in 2015, he again modified the frequently used clichÃ©: âWhat happens at Georgetown Prep, stays at Georgetown Prep.â He added: âThatâs been a good thing for all of us, I think.â [Make sense of the people, issues and ideas shaping the 2018 elections with our new politics newsletter.] Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, tweeted the video of Judge Kavanaugh making the quip and said: âI canât imagine any parent accepting this view.

Judge Kavanaugh has categorically denied the allegation. A hearing has been set for next week, and Judge Kavanaugh and Dr. Blasey have been asked to testify.

Kavanaugh to be the Supreme Courtâs 114th justice. The senators and Kavanaugh will make opening statements on Tuesday. Kavanaugh will answer questions the next two days. And those supporting and opposing his nomination will testify after that. Who is Brett Kavanaugh? Kavanaugh, 53, is a rarity for the Supreme Court: He was born in D.C., grew up in the Maryland suburbs and has lived his adult life in the area. He went to Georgetown Prep and resides with his wife and two daughters in Chevy Chase. Both his undergraduate and law degrees are from Yale, the same law school that produced Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel A. Alito Jr. and Sonia Sotomayor. For the Supreme Court term that began in 1993, he was a clerk for Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, the man he would replace. Justice Neil M. Gorsuch, Trumpâs first Supreme Court nominee, also worked in Kennedyâs chambers that term. The vast majority of Kavanaughâs professional life has been in government jobs rather than private practice. He served for four years as an assistant to independent counsel Kenneth Starr in the investigations of the Clinton administration and the suicide of Clinton aide Vince Foster.  He served five years in the administration of President George W. Bush, first as an associate counsel and then as staff secretary. Bush nominated Kavanaugh to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. After a bitter nomination fight that lasted for years, Kavanaugh was confirmed in 2006. He has been part of more than 300 opinions on that court, with a consistently conservative record. What are his confirmation chances? They are very good. When Democrats last controlled the Senate, they changed the judicial nomination process to dispose of a requirement that a supermajority vote was needed to end a filibuster and proceed on the nomination of a lower court judge. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) pushed through a change in 2017 to include Supreme Court nominees, in order to move forward the nomination of Gorsuch. For Kavanaugh, that means he will be confirmed if all Republican senators, who have a slim majority in the chamber, support him, regardless of Democratic opposition. Currently, no Republicans have announced opposition, and it appears more likely, as with Gorsuch, that several Democrats will cross over to vote for him. But that assumes there are no surprises at the hearing, or in the weeks following, as senators prepare to vote. McConnell wants to have Kavanaugh confirmed by the time the justices start their new term on Oct. 2. Who opposes his confirmation? Most Democratic senators oppose Kavanaugh. While they acknowledge his credentials, Democrats say Kavanaugh is too conservative and would push the court too far to the right, especially on important issues such as abortion, voting rights, affirmative action, the environment and gay rights. And so it follows that the loudest objections to Kavanaugh come from liberal organizations and groups dedicated to those issues. Because of the potential Kavanaugh holds to move the court in an opposite direction, some abortion rights groups and environmental organizations that in the past have remained neutral on Supreme Court nominees oppose Kavanaugh. How could the court change? Kavanaughâs is the rare Supreme Court nomination that could dramatically alter the court. Usually a president is replacing one liberal with another, or one conservative with someone else on the right. Both of President Barack Obamaâs nominations fit that pattern, for instance, as did Trumpâs choice of Gorsuch to take the place of the late justice Antonin Scalia. But Kavanaugh would be replacing the pivotal justice, one who most of the time voted with fellow conservatives but sided with liberals on some of the most important decisions the court made on social issues. Kavanaughâs confirmation would likely mean that Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. becomes the courtâs justice-in-the-middle. That is an unusual role for a chief justice. He has formed a majority with liberals in only a handful of cases. In the courtâs most recent decisions on affirmative action, abortion and gay rights , for instance, Kennedy provided the deciding vote, and Roberts sided with conservatives in the minority. Does this mean abortion will be outlawed?  Not necessarily. But it would indicate that more of the restrictions on the procedure that some states have enacted would be approved by the Supreme Court. Kennedy was part of the majority that in a 1992 case, Planned Parenthood v. Casey, upheld the basic guarantee of Roe v. Wade that a woman has a right to obtain an abortion. While the decision acknowledged a stateâs interest in protecting fetal life, it said restrictions could not impose an âundue burdenâ on a womanâs right. The fight since then has been over where to draw that line. Itâs possible that a court without Kennedy would overturn Casey and by extension, Roe. But it could also whittle away at the right by approving more restrictions. In the courtâs most recent look at abortion rights, for instance, Kennedy sided with the courtâs liberals in striking down a Texas law that imposed additional requirements of doctors and clinics. The majority said they were pretext for restricting access. Trump said during the campaign he would nominate only âpro-life judges,â and it is likely that Gorsuch and Kavanaugh, if they had been on the court at the time, would have sided with the other conservatives to uphold the law. There are numerous challenges to abortion restrictions imposed by states on their way to the Supreme Court. Will the health care law be overturned? That is certainly one reason Democrats give for opposing Kavanaughâs nomination. Another challenge to the Affordable Care Act has been filed by states that say recent action by Congress has undermined the legal argument the Supreme Court used to uphold the law. Kavanaugh may be amenable to such an argument, but this is one area where his replacement of Kennedy does not necessarily shift the court. Kennedy was in the minority when Roberts joined the courtâs liberals to uphold Obamacare on a 5 to 4 vote in 2010. The five justices that made up the majority are still on the court. Kennedy did vote with them in a second challenge to Obamacare, but his sixth vote was unnecessary to the outcome.",0.028,0.885,0.088,0.9959,0.5227723013265182

In a second day of testimony, Kavanaugh declined to comment on Trump’s criticism of the judiciary or offer praise of the president’s character.  Democrats at Kavanaugh’s Senate confirmation hearing also pressed the conservative federal appeals court judge over newly released emails highlighting his views on abortion and racial issues after a partisan fight over the public release of the documents.   The documents released on Thursday dated from Kavanaugh’s service in the White House under Republican President George W. Bush more than a decade ago. Democrats had objected to an earlier decision by the Senate Judiciary Committee’s Republican leadership not to make the emails public.  The third day of the confirmation hearing again was repeatedly interrupted by protesters hostile to Kavanaugh. The nominee, enduring back-to-back days of lengthy questioning, remained in good humor, making no gaffes that were likely to derail his confirmation in a Senate narrowly controlled by Trump’s fellow Republicans, despite the efforts of Democrats opposed to him.  Some liberals have expressed concern Kavanaugh could be a rubber stamp for Trump and protect him from lawsuits and investigations.  Asked by Democratic Senator Cory Booker whether he was picked because of an expectation of loyalty to Trump, Kavanaugh responded: “My only loyalty is to the Constitution. I’m an independent judge.”   Kavanaugh refused to say whether he had “the greatest respect” for Trump, a phrase Booker said he had used when describing Bush.  Democratic Senator Dick Durbin said Kavanaugh’s nomination comes at a time when Trump poses a threat to America’s rule of law and is facing an ongoing special counsel investigation. Kavanaugh said his 12 years as a judge demonstrated he was unafraid “to invalidate executive power when it violates the law.”  Kavanaugh had declined on Wednesday to answer whether a president would have to respond to a court’s subpoena, saying he could be asked to rule on the matter. But under questioning by Durbin on the scope of presidential power, Kavanaugh underscored judicial authority.  “When a court order requires a president to do something or prohibits a president from doing something under the Constitution or laws of the United States, under our constitutional system, that is the final word,” Kavanaugh said.  Kavanaugh, probed again on his views on a 1974 Supreme Court ruling against President Richard Nixon requiring recordings made in the Oval Office to be given to prosecutors, said the case was correctly decided. He called it “a moment of judicial independence where I think the court came together” in a unanimous decision.   Kavanaugh declined to answer questions on how that case could be applied relating to the investigation by Special Counsel Robert Mueller into potential collusion between Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign and Russia.  He also repeated his refusal to comment on whether he would recuse himself if a case involving the Mueller investigation or other issues relating to Trump’s conduct came before him.  If confirmed, Kavanaugh is seen as likely to tilt the top U.S. court even further to the right. That prospect worries Democrats and heartens Republicans on volatile issues including abortion, gun rights, gay rights, the death penalty, religious liberty and business regulation.  The committee considering Kavanaugh’s nomination will hear from outside witnesses on Friday before the hearing wraps up. Republicans hope the full Senate can vote on the nomination close to the time the Supreme Court’s new term starts on Oct 1.  In a 2003 email released on Thursday, Kavanaugh suggested striking a line from a draft opinion piece that had stated: “It is widely accepted by legal scholars across the board that Roe v. Wade and its progeny are the settled law of the land,” saying that the Supreme Court could overturn it.  Asked about that document, Kavanaugh said he suggested the change because he thought the draft language was overstating the thinking of legal scholars at the time. He again declined to say whether the landmark 1973 ruling that legalized abortion nationwide, Roe v. Wade, was correctly decided, although he indicated - as he did on Wednesday - that it was a decision that merited respect as “an important precedent of the Supreme Court.”  The hearing opened with Democrats complaining that various  documents had not already been made public by the committee’s Republican leaders. They were released by the committee minutes later.  Booker called the process used by the committee to decide which documents to make public “a bit of sham,” a characterization rejected by the panel’s Republican chairman, Chuck Grassley. Booker said he was willing to face possible punishment under Senate rules by releasing the documents himself, although Republicans said they had already agreed to release them.  Trump picked Kavanaugh, 53, to replace Justice Anthony Kennedy, who announced his retirement in June.

But federal appeals courts have issued starkly different rulings about whether border guards in those states can be held to account for shootings across the Mexican border that took the lives of two teenagers. In a dissent this month, a federal judge in California urged the Supreme Court to resolve the clashing rulings. It cannot be, Judge Milan D. Smith Jr. wrote, that guards standing on American soil in Arizona may be sued for cross-border killings but that ones standing in Texas cannot. âThis is an untenable result,â Judge Smith wrote, âand will lead to an uneven administration of the rule of law.â In the Arizona case, a border guard named Lonnie Swartz, standing on high ground, fired across the border onto a street in Nogales, killing a 16-year-old, JosÃ© Antonio Elena RodrÃ­guez. A divided three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, ruled this month that JosÃ© Antonioâs mother could sue Mr. Swartz for violating her sonâs constitutional rights. What was described in her lawsuit, Judge Andrew J. Kleinfeld wrote for the majority, âis simple and straightforward murder.â He added â and this is what divided the two appeals courts â that JosÃ© Antonioâs mother should not need congressional permission to sue. The Texas case differed only in the details. There, a border guard named Jesus Mesa Jr. shot a fleeing 15-year-old boy in the head, killing him. The boy, Sergio HernÃ¡ndez Guereca, had been playing with friends in the dry bed of the Rio Grande and was in Mexico when he was struck. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in New Orleans, said Sergioâs family could not sue Mr. Mesa. âThis is not a close case,â Judge Edith Jones wrote for the majority in March. Congress could pass a law allowing suits against federal officials by âaliens injured abroad,â she said. But without such a law, she wrote, federal courts should not âinterfere with the political branchesâ oversight of national security and foreign affairs.â The Supreme Court will soon consider whether to hear the Texas case, Hernandez v. Mesa, which has been before the justices once before. In the Arizona case, Rodriguez v. Swartz, a lawyer for Mr. Swartz filed papers last week indicating that he would seek Supreme Court review. If the Supreme Court agrees to hear one or both of the cases, the families of the boys may face an uphill fight. And there is little reason to think that Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh, President Trumpâs Supreme Court nominee, would be sympathetic to their arguments. In 2015, Judge Kavanaugh, who sits on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, joined a decision dismissing a lawsuit filed by an American citizen who said he had suffered months of abuse at the hands of American law enforcement officials in Kenya, Somalia and Ethiopia. In a concurring opinion, Judge Kavanaugh said the plaintiff, Amir Meshal, could not sue the officials for violating his constitutional rights because no statute authorized such suits. In 1971, in Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents, the Supreme Court ruled that such congressional authorization was not always needed for people to sue federal officials for violating their constitutional rights. But the court has grown increasingly uneasy about the decision, which concerned the unconstitutional search of a home in Brooklyn, and it has cautioned that the decision should not lightly be extended to new contexts. The Supreme Court itself has extended the Bivens decision only twice, most recently 38 years ago. Judge Kavanaugh wrote that the Bivens decision did not apply in Mr. Meshalâs case because it involved âa national security investigation in a foreign country.â âIf I were a member of Congress, I might vote to enact a new tort cause of action to cover a case like Meshalâs,â he wrote. âBut as judges, we do not get to make that decision.â In the Arizona case, Judge Kleinfeld said that an unprovoked, willful and needless killing warranted extending the Bivens decision to allow a suit from the boyâs mother. In the Texas case, Judge Jones wrote that only Congress could make that determination, particularly given the national security and diplomatic concerns at play. Both cases are at early stages, and for now judges must accept the version of events offered by the boysâ families. They must assume, that is, that the guards shot unarmed boys who posed no threat to them. Mr. Swartz, the guard in the Arizona case, also faces criminal charges. In April, a jury in federal court in Tucson found him not guilty of murder but deadlocked on a manslaughter charge. Federal prosecutors have said that they will retry him for manslaughter. In the civil suit against Mr. Swartz, his lawyer, Sean C. Chapman, told the Ninth Circuit that JosÃ© Antonioâs âdeath was tragic.â âThe morality of Agentâs Swartzâs conduct, however, is not a relevant factor for this courtâs consideration,â Mr. Chapman wrote. Lee Gelernt, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union, which represents JosÃ© Antonioâs mother, said the Ninth Circuitâs decision âcould not have come at a more important time, when this administration is seeking to further militarize the border.â The government of Mexico, for its part, urged the Supreme Court to hear the Texas case. âIt is a priority to Mexico to see that the United States has provided adequate means to hold the agents accountable and to compensate the victims,â Mexicoâs brief said. âThe United States would expect no less if the situation were reversed and a Mexican government agent had killed a U.S. national.â Follow Adam Liptak on Twitter @adamliptak.

Kavanaugh and his accuser devolved into a polarizing stalemate on Wednesday as Democrats and Republicans advanced competing narratives to convince voters that the other side has been unfair in the Supreme Court confirmation battle. Christine Blasey Ford, the professor who alleged that Judge Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when they were teenagers, said a Senate hearing set for Monday to hear her allegation would not be fair and Democrats insisted that an F.B.I. investigation take place first. Backed by President Trump, Senate Republicans rejected any F.B.I. inquiry, and said that Monday was her chance to be heard. Dr. Blaseyâs resistance to appearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Monday seemed to galvanize Republicans and drew wavering Republican senators back into Judge Kavanaughâs camp. Barring new information or an agreement by Dr. Blasey to testify after all, Judge Kavanaugh may now have enough momentum to be confirmed as early as next week. Republicans set a committee meeting for Wednesday for a possible vote to move the nomination to the floor. [Read how Dr. Blasey went from the anonymity of academia to the center of a Supreme Court confirmation.] Hanging over the impasse were the midterm elections, now less than seven weeks away. Republicans were determined to confirm Judge Kavanaugh before then, knowing that if Democrats managed to win control of the Senate, it would be exponentially harder to approve any nominees sent by Mr. Trump. Conversely, for Democrats, a delay in voting on Judge Kavanaugh would increase the chances of blocking his confirmation and enhance the influence Democrats would have over who eventually fills the vacant seat. In a statement, Lisa J. Banks, a lawyer for Dr. Blasey, said on Wednesday that her client was still willing to work with the Judiciary Committee, but was not convinced that a hearing featuring just her and Judge Kavanaugh would be adequate. âThe committeeâs stated plan to move forward with a hearing that has only two witnesses is not a fair or good faith investigation; there are multiple witnesses whose names have appeared publicly and should be included in any proceeding,â Ms. Banks said. âThe rush to a hearing is unnecessary, and contrary to the committee discovering the truth.â Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa and the committee chairman, said he was flexible on how to handle the questioning of Dr. Blasey but not on the date. He offered to hold a public hearing or to conduct the interview behind closed doors, whichever she preferred. He said she could be questioned by staff members rather than senators, and that he would even send lawyers to California to interview her, if she liked. But he rejected Dr. Blaseyâs request that the F.B.I. investigate her charges before any hearing and made clear that he would not postpone it past Monday. âIt would be a disservice to Dr. Ford, Judge Kavanaugh, this committee and the American people to delay this hearing any further,â he wrote in a letter to committee Democrats. [Read what Judge Kavanaughâs and Dr. Blaseyâs supporters are saying about her accusations against him.] The mood at the White House improved on Wednesday, and Mr. Trump referred to Judge Kavanaugh as âJustice Kavanaughâ three times during a seven-minute exchange with reporters. He again avoided directly attacking Dr. Blasey, but said he found her charges hard to believe. âI think itâs a very unfair thing whatâs going on,â the president said. Still, he seemed to leave open the possibility that he might have to find another nominee if Dr. Blasey proved persuasive. âLook, if she shows up and makes a credible showing, that will be very interesting and weâll have to make a decision,â Mr. Trump said. âBut I can only say this: He is such an outstanding man. Very hard for me to imagine that anything happened.â Democrats acknowledged that Republicans seemed to have reassured the members of their conference uneasy over the allegation and could confirm Judge Kavanaugh on the strength of their razor-thin 51-to-49 majority. âClearly, the Senate Republicans have decided to tough it out, and they are worried about one constituency at this point,â Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, said in an interview. âIt is not the American public; it is the six or seven Senate Republicans who objected last week to a hurry-up hearing. They think they have them back in their corner.â Still, the emergence of Dr. Blaseyâs allegation may have cost Republicans the chance of winning support from any of the red-state Democrats they were hoping to enlist. Senator Claire McCaskill, a Democrat facing a competitive re-election in Missouri, announced Wednesday that she will vote against confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh. Ms. McCaskill said she was concerned about the accusation against the judge, but based her decision on campaign finance law. âHe has revealed his bias against limits on campaign donations, which places him completely out of the mainstream of this nation,â she said in a statement. Dr. Blasey, 51, a university professor in Northern California who is also known by her married name, Ford, has accused Judge Kavanaugh, 53, of pinning her to a bed, groping her, trying to remove her clothing and covering her mouth to keep her from screaming during a party in the early 1980s when the two were teenagers in Maryland. Judge Kavanaugh has categorically denied the allegation, and the only other person Dr. Blasey said was in the room has also said he does not remember such an assault and had never seen Judge Kavanaugh behave that way. Another high school friend, Patrick J. Smyth, came forward on Wednesday, saying he was one of two other people Dr. Blasey identified being elsewhere in the house at the time of the alleged assault. In a letter to the Judiciary Committee, Mr. Smyth said he did not remember anything like it. âI have no knowledge of the party in question; nor do I have any knowledge of the allegations of improper conduct she has leveled against Brett Kavanaugh,â he wrote. He added, âI have never witnessed any improper conduct by Brett Kavanaugh towards women.â With the conflict over the confirmation and the supercharged allegations taking place so close to the midterms, both sides were deeply anxious about the possible effect and were eager to blame the other. Republicans argued that they have given Dr. Blasey an opportunity to tell her story to the Senate, either in public or in private, while Democrats said the refusal to call in the F.B.I. showed that the presidentâs party was not really interested in finding the truth. âThis process has been off the rails for a long time now, but the last 24 hours signal a new low,â said Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island. He noted that Dr. Blasey has been harassed and forced to leave her own home since bringing her account to the public. âIn the face of this, Republicans are jamming her into a âtake it or leave itâ kangaroo hearing without even the courtesy of proper investigation of her claims. It is a disgrace.â Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican committee member from South Carolina and ally of the presidentâs who traveled with him on Wednesday to view hurricane damage, said that requiring an F.B.I. investigation before a hearing would not be âabout finding the truth but delaying the process until after the midterm elections,â when Democrats hope to win control of the Senate. âIt is imperative the Judiciary Committee move forward on the Kavanaugh nomination and a committee vote be taken as soon as possible,â Mr. Graham said in a statement. For many Democrats, the insistence on quick action and the charge of obstructionism rang hollow given that Republicans refused to even meet with President Barack Obamaâs Supreme Court nominee, Judge Merrick B. Garland, in 2016. Judge Garland never received a hearing, and the vacant seat resulting from the death of Justice Antonin Scalia was eventually filled by Mr. Trumpâs first Supreme Court choice, Neil M. Gorsuch. Three of the Republican senators who had insisted on postponing a committee vote on Judge Kavanaugh originally scheduled for Thursday until hearing from Dr. Blasey have now said she should testify on Monday. âI donât think she can reject all those options because otherwise there are these very serious allegations hanging over the head of a nominee who has emphatically denied them,â Senator Susan Collins told a radio station in her home state, Maine, on Wednesday. âThatâs just not a good way for us to end. So I think she needs to come forward, and we need to provide her with any protection she may ask for herself and her family.â Ms. Collins noted that Dr. Blasey had secured the services of lawyers and should be prepared for testifying. âThereâs more than a week between when she made the allegations and the date of the hearing,â she said. âI just donât understand why the hearing shouldnât go forth.â Following the advice of aides, Mr. Trump refrained from any inflammatory comments about the court fight. âIf she shows up, that would be wonderful,â he told reporters before leaving for North Carolina. âIf she doesnât show up, that would be unfortunate.â âIâd really want to see her,â the president said. âI really would want to see what she has to say.â The allegations against Judge Kavanaugh appeared to diminish his public standing, according to a new Reuters/Ipsos poll. Opposition to his confirmation rose by six percentage points to 36 percent in a survey that began before Dr. Blasey went public and continued through Monday after The Post article. Only 31 percent said they support his confirmation, which would rank him among the lowest nominees if he were eventually confirmed. While Dr. Blasey and Democrats have called for an F.B.I. investigation before a hearing, it is unlikely the bureau would open a criminal investigation of Judge Kavanaugh because Dr. Blaseyâs accusations do not involve a potential federal crime. Sexual assault would typically be a state crime, and the passage of more than three decades would make any prosecution problematic, according to legal experts. Democrats pointed out on Wednesday that the F.B.I. was asked to investigate Anita F. Hillâs sexual harassment claims against Clarence Thomas when he was nominated for the Supreme Court in 1991. But Mr. Grassley said that happened when Ms. Hillâs allegations were still confidential and pointed out that she testified at a hearing only five days after her charges became public, much as Dr. Blasey is being asked to do. The F.B.I. does conduct background checks on Supreme Court nominees and passes along information to officials running the confirmation process, but it does not make judgments on the credibility of the claims, according to Justice Department guidelines. âThe F.B.I.âs role in such matters is to provide information for the use of the decision makers,â according to background check guidelines issued in 2010 during the Obama administration. While the F.B.I. should âapprise the president or his designated representativeâ when new information surfaces that raises questions about the suitability of an appointee, âthe F.B.I. does not make any judgment about the credibility or significance of any allegation.â Katie Benner and Catie Edmondson contributed reporting.

An allegation of sexual assault has thrown the Supreme Court confirmation of Judge Brett Kavanaugh into jeopardy, with the accuser seeking an F.B.I. investigation and Senator John Kennedy, a Louisiana Republican, saying her charge had turned the process into âan intergalactic freak show.â On âThe Late Late Showâ on Tuesday, James Corden said he didnât see things that way. ââAn intergalactic freak show.â I like to think that billions of light-years away, an emperor of some alien galaxy is really offended that someone just compared him to Brett Kavanaugh.â â JAMES CORDEN âRepublicans have also been critical of the timing of the misconduct allegation. They were like, âThis isnât how it works. Youâre supposed to find out weâre creeps after weâre confirmed.ââ â JAMES CORDEN And Seth Meyers sniped at the Trump administration for standing by Kavanaugh. âFollowing an accusation of sexual assault, Supreme Court justice nominee Brett Kavanaugh visited the White House today for the second day in a row. Itâs the first time an accused sexual assaulter has gotten into the White House without the Electoral College.â â SETH MEYERS âA new lawsuit came out, and it claims that female employees were harassed at Del Taco restaurants. Yeah, the lawsuit says the women were exposed to unwanted advances, crude remarks â and food from Del Taco.â â CONAN OâBRIEN âAmazon is planning to introduce up to eight new âsmartâ home devices this year, including a voice-controlled microwave oven. Though if you need voice control to use a microwave, maybe youâre too drunk to eat whatever youâre asking for.â â SETH MEYERS âStormy Daniels has written a book about Trump, and an advance copy just came out. And she actually writes about her night with Trump in detail. Which explains why every book comes with a bottle of Pepto-Bismol and a straw.â â JIMMY FALLON The director Glenn Weiss proposed to his girlfriend, Jan Friedlander Svendsen, on national TV on Monday after winning an Emmy. The award was for directing the 2018 Oscars broadcast, which Jimmy Kimmel hosted. Weiss and Svendsen appeared on âJimmy Kimmel Live!â on Tuesday night. Meanwhile, Meyersâs âJokes Seth Canât Tellâ segment returned on Tuesday, with a new set of punchlines too sensitive for him to read by himself. Peter Dinklage, who won his third Emmy on Monday for his role as Tyrion Lannister in âGame of Thrones,â will sit down with Kimmel on Wednesday.

 A post shared by Donald Trump Jr. (@donaldjtrumpjr) on Sep 15, 2018 at 12:30pm PDT In short, it compares Ford's disturbing account of Kavanaugh's behavior (which allegedly occurred when the nominee was 17 years old) to an elementary school crush. Trump, Jr. does not have a particular reputation for treading lightly around sensitive subjects, nor for being on the right side of history even a single time. But this is a new low, even for him.Â  He also can't seem to post a joke that makes sense â here, for example, he implies that Kavanaugh's transgression was some sort of written correspondence (""sexual assault letter""), which is extremely stupid. But then, what did we expect? This is the same person who did that Skittles socialism tweet. UPDATE: Sept. 19, 2018, 3:39 p.m. ET Congrats to Arizona senator Jeff Flake, who has spoken out about Don Jr.'s disgusting Instagram post four days late. Brave! This is sickening. No one should make light of this situation. pic.twitter.com/G7rlT3IKTQ â Jeff Flake (@JeffFlake) September 19, 2018 ",0.127,0.813,0.059,-0.9668,0.6446969696969697
