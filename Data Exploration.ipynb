       "'Advertisement Supported by Best of Late Night By Giovanni Russonello Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown of the previous nights highlights that lets you sleep  and lets us get paid to watch comedy. If youre interested in hearing from The Times regularly about great TV, sign up for our Watching newsletter and get recommendations straight to your inbox. An allegation of sexual assault has thrown the Supreme Court confirmation of Judge Brett Kavanaugh into jeopardy, with the accuser seeking an F.B.I. investigation and Senator John Kennedy, a Louisiana Republican, saying her charge had turned the process into an intergalactic freak show. On The Late Late Show on Tuesday, James Corden said he didnt see things that way. An intergalactic freak show. I like to think that billions of light-years away, an emperor of some alien galaxy is really offended that someone just compared him to Brett Kavanaugh.  JAMES CORDEN Republicans have also been critical of the timing of the misconduct allegation. They were like, This isnt how it works. Youre supposed to find out were creeps after were confirmed.  JAMES CORDEN And Seth Meyers sniped at the Trump administration for standing by Kavanaugh. Following an accusation of sexual assault, Supreme Court justice nominee Brett Kavanaugh visited the White House today for the second day in a row. Its the first time an accused sexual assaulter has gotten into the White House without the Electoral College.  SETH MEYERS A new lawsuit came out, and it claims that female employees were harassed at Del Taco restaurants. Yeah, the lawsuit says the women were exposed to unwanted advances, crude remarks  and food from Del Taco.  CONAN OBRIEN Amazon is planning to introduce up to eight new smart home devices this year, including a voice-controlled microwave oven. Though if you need voice control to use a microwave, maybe youre too drunk to eat whatever youre asking for.  SETH MEYERS Stormy Daniels has written a book about Trump, and an advance copy just came out. And she actually writes about her night with Trump in detail. Which explains why every book comes with a bottle of Pepto-Bismol and a straw.  JIMMY FALLON The director Glenn Weiss proposed to his girlfriend, Jan Friedlander Svendsen, on national TV on Monday after winning an Emmy. The award was for directing the 2018 Oscars broadcast, which Jimmy Kimmel hosted. Weiss and Svendsen appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live! on Tuesday night. Meanwhile, Meyerss Jokes Seth Cant Tell segment returned on Tuesday, with a new set of punchlines too sensitive for him to read by himself. Peter Dinklage, who won his third Emmy on Monday for his role as Tyrion Lannister in Game of Thrones, will sit down with Kimmel on Wednesday. Heres a rundown of the best and worst moments from the Emmys broadcast, according to our writers.
