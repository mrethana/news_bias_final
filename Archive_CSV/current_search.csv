The court order forces a witness to appear to give testimony.  In a second day of Senate hearings, Brett Kavanaugh said no-one was above the law but he would not be drawn on what he called a hypothetical question.  He also declined to say if he thought presidents could pardon themselves. The BBC's Gary O'Donoghue, in Washington, says the investigation into alleged collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia in the 2016 election has raised important constitutional questions about the extent to which an incumbent president can be forced to co-operate.  Democrats are keen to push Mr Kavanaugh on the issue, he adds. Mr Kavanaugh, 53, who faces a four-day confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, was also pressed on his approach to gun rights and the law around abortion. He said he understood the importance of the precedent in the landmark 1973 case, Roe v Wade, which legalised abortion nationwide, pointing out it had been reaffirmed by the Supreme Court several times. If confirmed, the conservative appeals court judge would be expected to tilt the court's balance to the right.  Chuck Grassley, the Republican chairman of the Judiciary Committee, asked Mr Kavanaugh whether he would have any trouble ruling against the president who nominated him, to which he responded: ""No-one is above the law in our constitutional system."" ""I think the first quality of a good judge in our constitutional system is independence,"" he added. Senior Democrat Dianne Feinstein asked if he thought a sitting president could be ""required to respond to a subpoena"". ""I can't give you an answer on that hypothetical question,"" Mr Kavanaugh said. He gave a similar answer to Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy who asked whether a president could issue a pardon to himself or to someone else in exchange for promising not to testify against the president. In a tweet in June, President Trump said he had ""the absolute right to PARDON myself"". On abortion, Mr Kavanaugh said he understood people's strong feelings and he described Roe v Wade as ""an important precedent of the Supreme Court that has been reaffirmed many times"". Supporters of abortion rights fear Mr Kavanaugh could provide the decisive fifth vote on the nine-seat court to overturn the 1973 ruling. On the issue of gun rights, Senator Feinstein pressed Mr Kavanaugh on his previous opposition to a ban on semi-automatic rifles. Such weapons have been used in a string of deadly high school shootings. ""Of course the violence in the schools is something we all detest and want to do something about,"" Mr Kavanaugh said, but added that handguns and other semi-automatic weapons were also used for hunting and self-defence. For a second day, protesters interrupted proceedings before being removed by security personnel. On Tuesday, there were angry scenes minutes after Mr Kavanaugh entered the committee rooms. The hearing was disrupted by angry shouts from members of the public and lawmakers alike. Texas Republican John Cornyn said it was ""the first confirmation hearing for a Supreme Court justice I've seen basically according to mob rule"". The US Capitol Police said 61 people were removed from the committee room on Tuesday and arrested for disorderly conduct. Republicans have a slim majority in the 100-seat upper house. They can confirm Mr Kavanaugh if they stay united. So far, there are no signs of Republican defections.  Not all Democrats have said they will oppose Mr Kavanaugh, and several may even support his nomination.  The Senate is likely to vote on confirmation by the end of the month. The court begins its next term in October. He studied law at Yale and is a resident of the wealthy Washington suburb of Chevy Chase.  He worked under special counsel Kenneth Starr in his investigation into President Bill Clinton's relationship with intern Monica Lewinsky in the 1990s.  Under George W Bush, he served as deputy White House counsel and, from 2003-06, as Mr Bush's staff secretary.  A Catholic, he has been a US Court of Appeals judge in Washington for the past 11 years.  Brett Kavanaugh's nomination will go to a full US Senate vote but talks continue over an FBI inquiry.

Allegations from a university professor, Christine Blasey Ford, emerged in the US media last week. She gave details of an incident which she says happened at a party in 1982.  Her lawyer has accused Republicans of trying to ""bully"" her with ""arbitrary"" and ""aggressive"" deadlines. The Friday deadline given by the Senate judiciary committee is now reported to have been switched to later on Saturday. President Donald Trump attacked Prof Ford's credibility on Friday, saying if the attack had been ""as bad as she says"", she would have reported it to the authorities sooner. Judge Kavanaugh has repeatedly denied the allegations. Prof Ford insists she is ready to testify at the hearing, but negotiations over certain conditions she has set out, including it not taking place until next Thursday, have delayed proceedings.  The committee originally granted her a deadline of 22:00 on Friday (02:00 GMT Saturday) to agree to revised terms - though it is not yet known what these are. But the professor's lawyer, Debra Katz, demanded another day to decide, saying: ""Its sole purpose is to bully Dr Ford and deprive her of the ability to make a considered decision that has life-altering implications for her and her family."" In response, Senator Chuck Grassley - the lead Republican on the committee - said he had granted Prof Ford ""another extension"" - which, according to the New York Times, runs until 14:30 on Saturday (18:30 GMT).  Judge Kavanaugh I just granted another extension to Dr Ford to decide if she wants to proceed w the statement she made last week to testify to the senate  She shld decide so we can move on  I want to hear her.  I hope u understand.  Its not my normal approach to b indecisive End of Twitter post  by @ChuckGrassley The allegation against Judge Kavanaugh, President Donald Trump's pick for the US top court, became public last week.  It emerged Prof Ford had detailed the alleged assault in a confidential letter to the top Democratic senator on the judiciary committee, Dianne Feinstein, in July.  As the judge neared confirmation, news about the letter leaked to US media. Ms Feinstein then confirmed she had passed it onto the FBI.  After days of continued media speculation, Prof Ford went on record in a Washington Post article as the mystery accuser, detailing the alleged assault.  She said Mr Kavanaugh tried to drunkenly remove her clothing at a party, pinned her to a bed and covered her mouth when she was 15 and he was 17. Since then, her lawyers have been in a back-and-forth with the judicial committee, trying to agree on terms for her to testify. She had asked for a number of preconditions, including not testifying with Mr Kavanaugh in the room and the subpoenaing of his friend, Mark Judge, who she said witnessed the alleged attempted rape.  Some Republicans, including President Trump, have accused her and Democratic politicians of deliberately trying to delay and obstruct the judge's confirmation, and urged them to push forward.  The feelings are strong on both sides - with both Prof Ford and Brett Kavanaugh and his wife both receiving threats and rallies of support over the matter.  The choice of a new justice for the Supreme Court is pivotal, as it often gives the final word on highly contentious laws and its nine judges have an immense impact on US public life. As Mr Trump's pick, Brett Kavanaugh has to first be approved by the Senate before he can take his seat - but before that vote can happen, he has to be approved by the judiciary committee, where Prof Ford may testify. The Senate is made up of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats - so any testimony she gives on the allegations could prove pivotal. Some have said there should not be a vote on his confirmation until Prof Ford has been heard.  President Trump weighed in heavily on the allegations on social media on Friday.  In a series of tweets, he questioned why law enforcement was not called at the time of the alleged assault, in 1982. I have no doubt that, if the attack on Dr. Ford was as bad as she says, charges would have been immediately filed with local Law Enforcement Authorities by either her or her loving parents. I ask that she bring those filings forward so that we can learn  date, time, and place! End of Twitter post  by @realDonaldTrump He also reiterated his full support for Judge Kavanaugh who he described as a ""fine man, with an impeccable reputation"".  Mr Trump's controversial comments were criticised by Democratic politicians and some Republicans.  Republican Senator Susan Collins said she was ""appalled"" by Mr Trump's tweet. ""We know that allegations of sexual assault - I'm not saying that's what happened in this case - but we know that allegations of sexual assault are one of the most unreported crimes that exist,"" she told reporters.  Only 23% of rapes and sexual assaults are reported to the police, according to the Department of Justice's 2016 report. On Friday, the hashtag #WhyIDidntReport trended on Twitter, with thousands sharing personal stories of sexual harassment and assault. Patti Davis, the daughter of President Ronald Reagan, wrote in the Washington Post that she was raped 40 years ago. ""It doesn't surprise me that for more than 30 years, Christine Blasey Ford didn't talk about the assault she remembers,"" she wrote, adding: ""It's important to understand how memory works in a traumatic event.""

It follows an allegation of sexual assault in the 1980s against President Donald Trump's pick, Brett Kavanaugh. Mr Kavanaugh denies the allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford. Both say they are willing to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee. The panel's vote on Mr Kavanaugh is at present scheduled for Thursday. The Supreme Court often gives the final word on highly contentious laws and its nine judges have an immense impact on US political life. If chosen for the lifetime appointment, Mr Kavanaugh would be expected to tilt the court's balance to the right. Mr Kavanaugh was seen arriving at the White House on Monday morning, although the reason for the visit was unclear. President Trump told reporters at the White House on Monday: ""If it takes a little delay, it takes a little delay."" He added of Mr Kavanaugh: ""He is one of the great intellects and one of the finest people that anybody has known."" When asked whether the judge might withdraw from the confirmation process, the Republican president said: ""What a ridiculous question that is."" Calls have mounted for senators to postpone a vote on the nomination. Arizona Republican Senator Jeff Flake, who sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said Prof Ford's testimony should be heard.  ""We need to hear from her,"" he told news website Politico. ""And I don't think I'm alone in this."" Bob Corker, a Tennessee Republican, also said the vote should be delayed until Prof Ford was heard, while Lisa Murkowski told CNN a delay was something ""they might have to consider"". Without saying whether or not she would support a delay, Republican Susan Collins tweeted on Monday: ""Professor Ford and Judge Kavanaugh should both testify under oath before the Judiciary Committee."" The Republican chairman of the committee, Chuck Grassley, issued a statement without addressing any delay in the vote or testimony. He said Prof Ford ""deserves to be heard"" and that the matter should be covered in follow-up calls to both her and Mr Kavanaugh, which he said he was trying to set up. Mr Grassley criticised both the Democrats and Prof Ford's lawyer for not bringing the allegations to the committee earlier. The Democrats have demanded a delay. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said: ""Trying to rush this through on Thursday is an insult to the women of America and an insult to the majesty of the Supreme Court."" Democratic Party Senator Dick Durbin, who serves on the judiciary committee, said the burden had been put on the panel to ""get to the bottom"" of the matter. Senior Republican Senator John Cornyn called on lawmakers to treat the process ""with bipartisan participation in a spirit of collaboration and concern for all involved"". Both Prof Ford and Mr Kavanaugh said on Monday they would be willing to appear. Prof Ford's lawyer, Debra Katz, said: ""She's willing to do what she needs to do."" Ms Katz said Prof Ford had ""decided to take control of this and tell this in her own voice"". In a statement on Monday, Mr Kavanaugh again said the accusations against him were ""completely false"" and that he would ""refute"" them before the panel. He said: ""I have never done anything like what the accuser describes - to her or to anyone."" White House adviser Kellyanne Conway said Prof Ford should ""not be insulted or ignored"" and should testify under oath, although that would be up to the committee to decide. Christine Blasey Ford, a professor of psychology at Palo Alto University, detailed her allegations in the Washington Post at the weekend. She told the newspaper she believed the incident happened in 1982, when she was 15 and Mr Kavanaugh was 17.  She said Mr Kavanaugh and a friend had allegedly ""corralled"" her into a bedroom at a gathering. Mr Kavanaugh and his friend were both drunk, she says. The Washington Post reported her account as follows: ""While his friend watched, she said, Kavanaugh pinned her to a bed on her back and groped her over her clothes, grinding his body against hers and clumsily attempting to pull off her one-piece bathing suit and the clothing she wore over it.  ""When she tried to scream, she said, he put his hand over her mouth."" Mr Kavanaugh ""categorically and unequivocally"" denied the allegation last week.  Mark Judge, who has been named as the third person in the room, told The Weekly Standard the allegations were ""absolutely nuts"". Prof Ford spoke of the alleged attack a couple of times over the subsequent decades, including during therapy. Mr Trump's nomination of Mr Kavanaugh revived the pain of the memory, she said, prompting her to approach Democratic lawmakers with her allegations in July. Mr Kavanaugh, 53, was questioned during four days of hearings at the Senate Judiciary Committee last week, which are now complete.  The committee is due to vote on Thursday on whether his nomination should go forward to a full vote in the Senate.  The Republicans only have a single-vote majority on the committee, which they control 11 to 10, while they hold the Senate by just 51-49. Mr Kavanaugh is strongly opposed by some Democrats for his views on issues such as abortion, and it seems unlikely any of them will cross the aisle to vote with their Republican colleagues. This means it would take just Mr Flake to potentially derail Thursday's committee vote, while only two Republican defections would swing the outcome away from Mr Kavanaugh in the Senate. By Anthony Zurcher, BBC North America reporter This episode recalls another high-stakes confirmation battle more than 25 years ago, when then-judge Clarence Thomas faced sexual harassment allegations during his Supreme Court hearings. Mr Thomas prevailed, but the ordeal left both sides bruised and bitter, and may have contributed to the surge in women elected to Congress in 1992. Now history seemingly repeats itself, this time in the shadow of the #MeToo movement. With the disposition of the Supreme Court for a generation in the balance, and mid-term congressional elections less than two months away, the stakes couldn't be higher.

 Brett Kavanaugh, Donald Trumps conservative nominee for the US supreme court, faced sharp questions on Capitol Hill on some of the hottest issues raging in American society  abortion, gun rights and presidential power  during the second day of his dramatic confirmation hearing. Amid hours of intense questioning on Wednesday, Kavanaugh declined to say how he would rule if the supreme court were to once again weigh the legality of abortion and similarly dodged on whether the president has the authority to pardon himself. The atmosphere was a little calmer, after the opening day on Tuesday quickly became a cacophony of yelling protesters incensed at the choice of Kavanaugh and repeated interruptions by Democratic senators angry at the late disclosure of documents by the White House about the judges track record. But demonstrations continued inside the US Senate building on Wednesday, with occasional outbursts from protesters, such as: Sham president, sham justice! and No Trump puppet! As members of Congress weighed his suitability for Americas top judicial bench, Kavanaugh said he understood the significance of Roe v Wade, the landmark 1973 supreme court decision that legalized abortion in the US. But he declined to respond when asked if he would make a commitment against overturning the law. He also successfully dodged the question of whether a president must respond to a subpoena  neatly sidestepping an intensely contested topic against the backdrop of special counsel Robert Muellers investigation into potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Moscow. The wide-ranging testimony underscored the potential for Kavanaughs nomination to shape the supreme court and the decisions before it for decades to come. Kavanaugh, a federal appeals judge, was nominated by Trump in July to replace the retiring justice Anthony Kennedy, who had been a critical swing vote on the nine-member bench. Kennedy had a track record of siding with the more liberal justices on the bench on some decisions, the more conservative wing on others. Kavanaugh is expected to push the court to the right. On Wednesday, members of the Senate committee were granted up to 30 minutes each to grill Kavanaugh on a variety of subjects. But he remained vague on what his approach would be to several issues at the forefront of his nomination. Chief among them was his views on abortion amid concerns that Kavanaughs confirmation will all but ensure an end to legal abortion across the US, long a goal of ultra-conservatives. But in the hearing Kavanaugh mostly stuck to reciting the facts of the case without disclosing his own legal view. I understand the importance of the precedent set forth in Roe v Wade, he said. It has been reaffirmed many times over the past 45 years. Asked directly by Dianne Feinstein, the Democratic senator from California, for his position on a womans right to choose, Kavanaugh again cited legal precedent, while adding: I understand how passionately and deeply people feel about the issue. I dont live in a bubble. I live in the real world. Kavanaughs comments will do little to pacify skeptics, who have cited his opposition to a court ruling last year that an undocumented immigrant teenager who was in government custody was entitled to seek an abortion. Pressed on the case in Wednesdays hearing, Kavanaugh said he was following his interpretation of parental consent provisions in the law. (The teen followed state law, obtaining permission to seek an abortion from a judge in the absence of parental consent.) ""I'm a judge, I'm not making the policy decision, Kavanaugh said. On Twitter, Hillary Clinton urged her followers to join the pressure campaign against Kavanaugh by calling their senators. If Brett Kavanaugh becomes a supreme court justice, will he help gut or overturn Roe v Wade, which legalized abortion in America? Yes, of course he will, the former presidential nominee tweeted. In another consequential exchange, Kavanaugh would not say if a president was legally obligated to comply with a subpoena. I cant give you an answer on that hypothetical question, he said. The question, posed by Feinstein, was an unmistakable reference to the legal challenges facing Trump. The presidents repeated efforts to undermine the Russia investigation  and threats to dismiss the special counsel  have amplified the potential for the matter to eventually reach the courts. Senator Patrick Leahy, a Democrat from Vermont, asked Kavanaugh point blank if presidents have the absolute right to pardon themselves. The judge once again demurred. The question of self-pardons is something I've never analyzed, Kavanaugh said. It's a hypothetical question that I can't begin to answer in this context. Kavanaugh also described US v Nixon, the supreme court ruling that ordered then President Richard Nixon to turn over secret White House recordings toward the end of the Watergate investigation, as one of the greatest moments in American judicial history. He had previously signaled it may have been wrongly decided. Democrats have raised concerns that if the special counsel investigation were to make its way to the supreme court, Kavanaugh could not be impartial toward the president who appointed him. Kavanaugh insisted the White House was subject to the law, but left Democrats on the panel frustrated over his refusal to say where, exactly, the presidents authority might be limited. Kavanaugh would not comment on whether a president could fire the special counsel investigating him and said it was up to Congress to determine what would constitute an impeachable offense. He did, however, push back on the notion that he would be loyal to Trump. ""If confirmed to the Supreme Court and as a sitting judge, I owe my loyalty to the Constitution,"" Kavanaugh said, while holding up a personal copy of the legal document. The Republicans have a razor-thin majority in the Senate but are nevertheless expected to have the votes to confirm Kavanaugh before the midterm elections in November.

Kavanaugh to be the …",right,text,2018-09-03T17:31:18Z,the-washington-post,The Washington Post,"The Senate Judiciary Committee has scheduled an extraordinary and likely decisive hearing Thursday on President Trumps nomination of Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh to be the Supreme Courts 114th justice. The senators will consider decades-old sexual misconduct allegations leveled at Kavanaugh since the committee earlier held four days of hearings on the judges nomination. Who is Brett Kavanaugh? Kavanaugh, 53, is a rarity for the Supreme Court: He was born in Washington, grew up in the Maryland suburbs and has lived his adult life in the area. He went to Georgetown Preparatory School and resides with his wife and two daughters in Chevy Chase. His undergraduate and law degrees are from Yale, the school where Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel A. Alito Jr. and Sonia Sotomayor also earned law degrees. For the Supreme Court term that began in 1993, he was a clerk for Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, the man he would replace. Justice Neil M. Gorsuch, Trumps first Supreme Court nominee, also worked in Kennedys chambers that term. The vast majority of Kavanaughs professional life has been in government jobs rather than private practice. He served for four years as an assistant to independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr in the investigations of the Clinton administration and the suicide of Clinton aide Vince Foster. He served five years in the administration of President George W. Bush, first as an associate counsel and then as staff secretary. Bush nominated Kavanaugh to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. After a bitter nomination fight that lasted years, Kavanaugh was confirmed in 2006. He has been part of more than 300 opinions on that court, with a consistently conservative record. What are his confirmation chances? Before allegations of sexual misconduct as a teenager, they were very good. The confirmation process is tilted in favor of the nominee when the White House and Senate are controlled by the same political party. When Democrats last controlled the Senate, they changed the judicial nomination process to dispose of a requirement for a supermajority vote to proceed on the nomination of a lower-court judge. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) pushed through a change in 2017 to include Supreme Court nominees, to move forward the nomination of Gorsuch. Republicans have a slim majority in the chamber. For Kavanaugh, that means he will be confirmed if all GOP senators support him, regardless of Democratic opposition. No Republicans have announced opposition, and several Democrats said they are keeping an open mind. Several voted for Gorsuch. What are the allegations? Christine Blasey Ford alleges that sometime in 1982, at a friends house, Kavanaugh pinned her on a bed, drunkenly groped her, tried to take off her clothes and put his hand over her mouth when she tried to scream. Ford said a friend of Kavanaugh, Mark Judge, was in the room  but neither Judge nor others who she said were in the house at the time have claimed any knowledge or memory of the incident. After Fords allegations surfaced, New Yorker magazine reported that Deborah Ramirez, a classmate of Kavanaughs at Yale, said he exposed himself at a party when they were both first-year students. Ramirez, who told the magazine that they both had been drinking at the time of the incident, acknowledged gaps in her memory but said she remembered Kavanaugh pulling up his pants and another student shouting Kavanaughs name. In an appearance with his wife, Ashley, on a Fox News show Monday, Kavanaugh repeated his denial that either event took place. The truth is Ive never sexually assaulted anyone, in high school or otherwise, he said. Who opposes his confirmation? Most Democratic senators oppose Kavanaugh. Besides the allegations, Democrats have complained that Kavanaugh is too conservative and would push the court too far to the right, especially on issues such as abortion, voting rights, affirmative action, the environment and gay rights. And so it follows that the loudest objections to Kavanaugh come from liberal organizations and groups dedicated to those issues. Because of the potential Kavanaugh holds to move the court to the right, some abortion rights groups and environmental organizations that in the past have remained neutral on Supreme Court nominees have opposed Kavanaugh. How could the court change? Kavanaughs is the rare Supreme Court nomination that could dramatically alter the court. Usually a president is replacing one liberal with another, or one conservative with someone else on the right. Both of President Barack Obamas nominations fit that pattern, for instance, as did Trumps choice of Gorsuch to take the place of Justice Antonin Scalia after his death. But Kavanaugh would be replacing a pivotal justice, one who most of the time voted with fellow conservatives but sided with liberals on some of the most important decisions the court made on social issues. Kavanaughs confirmation would probably mean that Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. would become the courts justice-in-the-middle. That is an unusual role for a chief justice. He has formed a majority with liberals in only a handful of cases. In the courts most recent decisions on affirmative action, abortion and gay rights, for instance, Kennedy provided the deciding vote and Roberts sided with conservatives in the minority. Does this mean abortion will be outlawed? Not necessarily. But it would indicate that more of the restrictions on the procedure that some states have enacted would be approved by the Supreme Court. Kennedy was part of the majority that in a 1992 case, Planned Parenthood v. Casey, upheld the basic guarantee of Roe v. Wade that a woman has a right to obtain an abortion. While the decision acknowledged a states interest in protecting fetal life, it said restrictions could not impose an undue burden on a womans right. The fight since then has been over where to draw that line. Its possible that a court without Kennedy would overturn Casey and, by extension, Roe. But it could also whittle away at the right by approving more restrictions. In the courts most recent look at abortion rights, Kennedy sided with the courts liberals in striking down a Texas law that imposed additional requirements of doctors and clinics. The majority said they were pretext for restricting access. Trump said during the campaign he would nominate only pro-life judges, and it is likely that Gorsuch and Kavanaugh, if they had been on the court at the time, would have sided with the other conservatives to uphold the law. There are numerous challenges to abortion restrictions imposed by states on their way to the Supreme Court. Will the health-care law be overturned? That is certainly one reason Democrats give for opposing Kavanaughs nomination. Another challenge to the Affordable Care Act has been filed by states that say recent action by Congress has undermined the legal argument the Supreme Court used to uphold the law. Kavanaugh may be amenable to such an argument, but this is one area where his replacement of Kennedy does not necessarily shift the court. Kennedy was in the minority when Roberts joined the courts liberals to uphold the health-care law on a 5-to-4 vote in 2010. The five justices that made up the majority are still on the court. Kennedy did vote with them in a second challenge to the ACA, but his sixth vote was unnecessary to the outcome.","Who is Brett Kavanaugh, President Trump's pick for Supreme Court? - Washington Post",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/who-is-brett-kavanaugh/2018/09/03/d9226b68-af7d-11e8-a20b-5f4f84429666_story.html,https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/rLQM9y3RRXWsto6IFmJF30xIYB8=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/GFVGRJVPRYI6RIQLL5HYIQUWMY.jpg,15

Reports say an unidentified woman claimed in a letter to Democrats that Mr Kavanaugh tried to force himself on her at a party in the early 1980s. Senate Democrats on Thursday disclosed that they had referred a complaint to federal investigators. The judge faces a confirmation vote to join the Supreme Court next week. In a statement on Friday, the appeals court judge said: ""I categorically and unequivocally deny this allegation. I did not do this back in high school or at any time."" The alleged incident took place when Mr Kavanaugh was a minor and student at Georgetown Preparatory School in Bethesda, Maryland. The woman - who asked not to be identified - was also a minor and a student at a nearby high school. Her letter alleges the now judge held her down and covered her mouth with his hand.  They were in a room with a classmate of Mr Kavanaugh's, and both boys had been drinking, before turning up the music to muffle her sound of protests, she alleges. The woman was able to free herself, the New Yorker said.  Although the alleged incident was decades ago, the woman said the memory had caused ongoing distress and she had sought psychological treatment. The woman first approached Democratic lawmakers in July, shortly after Mr Trump's nomination of him revived the pain of the memory, US media said.  She reportedly sent a letter to her local congresswoman, Democrat Anna Eshoo, and Senator Dianne Feinstein, the committee's top Democrat. Ms Feinstein said the woman ""strongly requested confidentiality, declined to come forward or press the matter further, and I have honoured that decision"".  ""I have, however, referred the matter to federal investigative authorities,"" she said Thursday. Anonymous sources, including a Democratic aide, confirmed to the Associated Press the allegation is of a sexual nature. Mr Kavanaugh is a controversial pick for replacing Justice Anthony Kennedy and he is strongly opposed by some Democrats for his views, such as on abortion. The 53-year-old was questioned during four days of hearings with the Senate Judiciary Committee last week. If chosen for the lifetime appointment next Thursday, the conservative appeals court judge would be expected to tilt the Supreme Court's balance to the right.

Here are the women and what they have alleged about the nominee.  The first woman to come forward with allegations against Mr Kavanaugh was psychology professor Christine Blasey Ford. Originally intending to be anonymous, she came forward as his accuser last week. She is due to outline her allegations of sexual assault by Judge Kavanaugh at a high school party more than 30 years ago at a Senate hearing on Thursday.  She alleges Mr Kavanaugh assaulted her when she was 15, and he was 17. She says he tried to remove her clothing, pinned her to a bed and covered her mouth at a house party in 1982. Now 51, she is a professor at Palo Alto University in California and teaches students clinical psychology.  Her husband since 2002, Russell Ford, has signed one of four sworn declarations supporting her allegation.  On Sunday a second woman, Mr Kavanaugh's Yale classmate Deborah Ramirez, went public with allegations of misconduct against the judge.  She alleges he exposed his genitals in her face during a drinking game at a college dormitory party - causing her to make contact with them as she tried to push him away. Another serious credible and disturbing allegation.

She was originally raised in Connecticut, and now lives with her family in Boulder, Colorado, working as a volunteer coordinator in financial aid.  On Wednesday Julie Swetnick became the third woman to make public allegations against Mr Kavanaugh.  The 55-year-old lives in Washington DC and works for the US Department of Treasury US Mint and Internal Revenue Service - having previously worked in other US government offices. She alleges that between 1981 and 1983 she attended various house parties where Mr Kavanaugh was present and that him and his friends tried to ""spike"" girls' drinks with drugs and alcohol to cause girls to lose their inhibitions. She says she was the victim of a gang rape in 1982 at a party attended by the judge. Brett Kavanaugh's nomination will go to a full US Senate vote but talks continue over an FBI inquiry.

In a second day of testimony, Kavanaugh declined to comment on Trumps criticism of the judiciary or offer praise of the presidents character.  Democrats at Kavanaughs Senate confirmation hearing also pressed the conservative federal appeals court judge over newly released emails highlighting his views on abortion and racial issues after a partisan fight over the public release of the documents.   The documents released on Thursday dated from Kavanaughs service in the White House under Republican President George W. Bush more than a decade ago. Democrats had objected to an earlier decision by the Senate Judiciary Committees Republican leadership not to make the emails public.  The third day of the confirmation hearing again was repeatedly interrupted by protesters hostile to Kavanaugh. The nominee, enduring back-to-back days of lengthy questioning, remained in good humor, making no gaffes that were likely to derail his confirmation in a Senate narrowly controlled by Trumps fellow Republicans, despite the efforts of Democrats opposed to him.  Some liberals have expressed concern Kavanaugh could be a rubber stamp for Trump and protect him from lawsuits and investigations.  Asked by Democratic Senator Cory Booker whether he was picked because of an expectation of loyalty to Trump, Kavanaugh responded: My only loyalty is to the Constitution. Im an independent judge.   Kavanaugh refused to say whether he had the greatest respect for Trump, a phrase Booker said he had used when describing Bush.  Democratic Senator Dick Durbin said Kavanaughs nomination comes at a time when Trump poses a threat to Americas rule of law and is facing an ongoing special counsel investigation. Kavanaugh said his 12 years as a judge demonstrated he was unafraid to invalidate executive power when it violates the law.  Kavanaugh had declined on Wednesday to answer whether a president would have to respond to a courts subpoena, saying he could be asked to rule on the matter. But under questioning by Durbin on the scope of presidential power, Kavanaugh underscored judicial authority.  When a court order requires a president to do something or prohibits a president from doing something under the Constitution or laws of the United States, under our constitutional system, that is the final word, Kavanaugh said.  Kavanaugh, probed again on his views on a 1974 Supreme Court ruling against President Richard Nixon requiring recordings made in the Oval Office to be given to prosecutors, said the case was correctly decided. He called it a moment of judicial independence where I think the court came together in a unanimous decision.   Kavanaugh declined to answer questions on how that case could be applied relating to the investigation by Special Counsel Robert Mueller into potential collusion between Trumps 2016 presidential campaign and Russia.  He also repeated his refusal to comment on whether he would recuse himself if a case involving the Mueller investigation or other issues relating to Trumps conduct came before him.  If confirmed, Kavanaugh is seen as likely to tilt the top U.S. court even further to the right. That prospect worries Democrats and heartens Republicans on volatile issues including abortion, gun rights, gay rights, the death penalty, religious liberty and business regulation.  The committee considering Kavanaughs nomination will hear from outside witnesses on Friday before the hearing wraps up. Republicans hope the full Senate can vote on the nomination close to the time the Supreme Courts new term starts on Oct 1.  In a 2003 email released on Thursday, Kavanaugh suggested striking a line from a draft opinion piece that had stated: It is widely accepted by legal scholars across the board that Roe v. Wade and its progeny are the settled law of the land, saying that the Supreme Court could overturn it.  Asked about that document, Kavanaugh said he suggested the change because he thought the draft language was overstating the thinking of legal scholars at the time. He again declined to say whether the landmark 1973 ruling that legalized abortion nationwide, Roe v. Wade, was correctly decided, although he indicated - as he did on Wednesday - that it was a decision that merited respect as an important precedent of the Supreme Court.  The hearing opened with Democrats complaining that various  documents had not already been made public by the committees Republican leaders. They were released by the committee minutes later.  Booker called the process used by the committee to decide which documents to make public a bit of sham, a characterization rejected by the panels Republican chairman, Chuck Grassley. Booker said he was willing to face possible punishment under Senate rules by releasing the documents himself, although Republicans said they had already agreed to release them.  Trump picked Kavanaugh, 53, to replace Justice Anthony Kennedy, who announced his retirement in June.

Mr Trump questioned why law enforcement was not called at the time of the alleged assault, in 1982, if it was ""as bad as she says"". The nomination of Brett Kavanaugh has been held up while the allegations of Christine Blasey Ford are assessed. Both have agreed to testify before a Senate committee. However, Prof Ford has set out conditions for her appearance which have yet to be agreed by the Senate Judiciary Committee. US media report that the panel has now offered to hold the hearing next Wednesday.  This counteroffer reportedly requires Prof Ford to testify before Judge Kavanaugh, which goes against one of her conditions. The committee must approve the nomination before it passes to the full Senate for a vote. The choice of a new justice for the Supreme Court is pivotal, as it often gives the final word on highly contentious laws and its nine judges have an immense impact on US public life. In a series of tweets, the president again delivered his full support for Judge Kavanaugh, saying he was a ""fine man, with an impeccable reputation"". He went on: ""I have no doubt that, if the attack on Dr Ford was as bad as she says, charges would have been immediately filed with local Law Enforcement Authorities by either her or her loving parents. I ask that she bring those filings forward so that we can learn date, time, and place!"" He added: ""Why didn't someone call the FBI 36 years ago?"" Mr Trump also attacked ""radical left wing politicians who don't want to know the answers, they just want to destroy and delay"". The radical left lawyers want the FBI to get involved NOW. Why didnt someone call the FBI 36 years ago? End of Twitter post  by @realDonaldTrump Following the president's controversial comments, the hashtag #WhyIDidntReport began trending on Twitter, with thousands sharing personal stories of sexual harassment and assault. By Friday afternoon, the hashtag had over 122,000 tweets from both women and men. President Trump had also weighed in on the process on Thursday, telling Fox News: ""I don't think you can delay it any longer. They've delayed it a week already... they have to get on with it."" The Senate Judiciary Committee vote on Judge Kavanaugh had originally been scheduled for Thursday of this week. The details of the alleged assault during a gathering of teenagers at a house in Montgomery County, Maryland, were carried in the Washington Post last Sunday when Prof Ford decided to go public. She told the newspaper that she discussed the alleged assault in 2012 when she attended couples therapy with her husband. The psychology professor at Palo Alto University in California said she was being treated for what she said had been the long-term effects of the incident. She told a senior Democratic lawmaker of her allegation in a confidential letter this summer and only consented to be named after it was leaked. Judge Kavanaugh has repeatedly denied the claim. Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC North America reporter Donald Trump, much to the reported surprise of some in the White House, had largely held his tongue about the twists in the Brett Kavanaugh nomination. That ended on Friday morning. With his nominee in peril - the level of danger seems to vary by the hour - the president has now jumped into the debate with both feet. His suggestion that ""loving"" parents would have reported an alleged sexual assault to the police and implication that the incident may or may not be ""as bad as she says"" are exactly the kind of inflammatory statement some Republicans feared the president would feel drawn to make. The president's comments will almost certainly help rally his base to Judge Kavanaugh's defence. It could also damage support for the nomination - already fairly low - among women and independents who could cast key votes in the upcoming mid-term elections. In the end, however, what matters most for Judge Kavanaugh's fate is how Mr Trump's involvement affects Republican support in the Senate. The confirmation process is already hopelessly politicised, as Republicans accuse Democrats of bad-faith delay tactics and Democrats renew their call for a wider hearing process. The only thing that seems clear is that the process will get nastier before it's all over. What does the committee say? Committee chairman Chuck Grassley had called for written testimony by this Friday from Prof Ford and scheduled a hearing on the matter for Monday. Her lawyer, Debra Katz, rejected this and in a phone call to the panel on Thursday spelled out her client's conditions for testifying. They include: There are problems with at least three of the requests. The Senate Judiciary Committee would have to change the Monday hearing. It is also not traditional for the accused to testify first and not have an opportunity for rebuttal. White House adviser Kellyanne Conway said: ""Asking for that usual sequence to be reversed is very unusual."" Neither is it traditional for any subpoenas to be issued for the nomination process. However, Ms Katz suggested there appeared to be room for negotiation when she sent a letter to the committee after the phone call, saying: ""The only issue I said was a deal breaker was that Dr Ford cannot appear at a hearing on Monday."" Prof Ford, Judge Kavanaugh and his wife have all been receiving threats, as the case becomes increasingly contentious. Ms Katz said of her client: ""She's been receiving death threats which have been reported to the FBI and she and her family have been forced out of their home.""  Fox News said it had obtained emails showing graphic and violent threats to Ashley Kavanaugh, who married the judge in 2004. But supporters of both Judge Kavanaugh and Prof Ford have also been vocal. A group of friends and former colleagues of the judge held a press briefing on Friday behind the banner #IStandWithBrett. Maura Fitzgerald, a friend since high school, said: ""The allegation against Brett is inconsistent with everything that I have known about him as a person."" Twelve of Prof Ford's family members have written an open letter, posted on Twitter, in which they call her ""highly ethical"", adding that ""her honesty is above reproach"". ""Chrissy is not someone who chooses to be in the spotlight,"" the letter said. Brett Kavanaugh's nomination will go to a full US Senate vote but talks continue over an FBI inquiry.

Christine Blasey Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that Brett Kavanaugh's attack on her had left her ""afraid and ashamed"". Mr Kavanaugh has denied allegations by Dr Ford, along with those of a number of other women. He is now testifying to the committee. The nine-member Supreme Court plays a vital role in US political life, as it has the final say on US law. This includes highly contentious social issues, such as abortion, and challenges to government policy. President Trump has called the hearing an ""important day in the history of our country"". No-one had heard from 51-year-old Dr Ford publicly since the allegations arose. After addresses by the leading Republican and Democrat members, Dr Ford delivered her opening statement, at times close to tears. In her testimony, Dr Ford said: ""I am here today not because I want to be. I am terrified. I am here because I believe it is my civic duty to tell you what happened to me while Brett Kavanaugh and I were in high school."" She alleged Mr Kavanaugh and his friend Mark Judge had locked her in a bedroom during a small gathering at a house in a Washington DC suburb in the summer of 1982. She said Mr Kavanaugh had tried to remove her clothing, pinned her to a bed and groped her, when she was 15 and he was 17. Both men were ""drunkenly laughing"", she said. She added: ""Brett's assault on me drastically altered my life. For a very long time, I was too afraid and ashamed to tell anyone the details."" Under questioning by a Democratic senator, she said her most vivid memory was ""the laughter between the two and their having fun at my expense... they were laughing with each other - two friends having a really good time with one another"". In an answer to another Democratic senator's question about claims of mistaken identity, Dr Ford said she was ""100%"" certain it was Mr Kavanaugh who had assaulted her.  The 21 senators on the committee were given five minutes each to ask her questions. The 10 Democrats posed questions themselves, many paying tribute to Dr Ford's bravery in coming forward - and supporting her call for an FBI investigation into her allegations. The 11 Republicans, all men, deferred most of their questions to a female lawyer, Phoenix prosecutor Rachel Mitchell. Taking a combative approach but occasionally becoming emotional, Mr Kavanaugh, 53, said he ""categorically"" denied Dr Ford's allegation and all other accusations against him. He accused Democratic senators of destroying his family and his good name for political reasons. ""This confirmation process has become a national disgrace,"" he told the committee. ""The constitution gives the Senate an important role in the confirmation process, but you have replaced advice and consent with search and destroy.   ""Since my nomination in July there has been a frenzy on the left to come up with something, anything to block my confirmation."" He insisted he would not be ""intimidated"" into withdrawing from the process. ""You may defeat me in the final vote but you'll never get me to quit. Never."" Mr Kavanaugh said he did not doubt that Dr Ford had been assaulted, but insisted: ""I've never sexually assaulted Dr Ford - or anyone."" He admitted he had drunk beer while at high school and under-age, but said he had never got so drunk as to forget events. He added that his calendars for 1982 - which he had kept - showed he had not attended a party at the location Dr Ford had described. Under hostile questioning from Democratic senators, he repeatedly insisted he was innocent and said an FBI investigation would be useless as it would not reach conclusions. Yes, and new ones appeared as the hearing loomed. At present they are: Mr Kavanaugh denies these allegations. In his written testimony he says: ""Over the past few days, other false and uncorroborated accusations have been aired. There has been a frenzy to come up with something - anything, no matter how far-fetched or odious - that will block a vote on my nomination. ""These are last-minute smears, pure and simple."" He has portrayed the events in political terms, accusing the Democrats of trying to block the nomination. Mr Trump has repeatedly defended the judge's character, saying he is ""one of the highest quality people"" he has ever met. But the president on Wednesday did say he could withdraw the nomination if accusations against the judge were proven. He said: ""I can always be convinced. If I thought he was guilty of something like this, yes, sure. It's possible I'll hear that, and I'll say, 'hey, I'm changing my mind'. I want to watch."" The Senate Judiciary Committee must vote on Mr Kavanaugh's confirmation before it goes to the full Senate for a vote there. The committee is scheduled to vote on Friday but its chairman, Republican Senator Chuck Grassley, has left open the possibility of a further delay. All 10 Democratic senators on the committee have called on President Trump to ""immediately withdraw"" Mr Kavanaugh's nomination. Republicans want their nominee in place before mid-term elections next month, when they could lose their 51-49 control of the Senate. Any confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh could also affect female voters in November. The confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas in 1991, despite allegations of sexual harassment, fuelled the rise of a new generation of female politicians in elections the following year. By BBC North America editor Jon Sopel It is hard to overstate the passions, the conspiracy theories, the mistrust and division this Supreme Court appointment has stirred. To make sense of this you have to understand two things about the Supreme Court - justices are appointed for life, and the Supreme Court, not politicians will ultimately decide on the most contentious issues of the day - from desegregating schools in the 1950s to abortion law, to gun control and to same-sex marriage. It was the Supreme Court that decided the outcome of the 2000 presidential election in favour of George W Bush. You name it, they rule on it.  In the 2016 election, many Republicans voted for Donald Trump while holding their nose - but they did so because they thought he'd deliver on their long cherished dream of delivering a Supreme Court with a clear conservative majority for a generation. Now they fear it is slipping away.  And the fact that Brett Kavanaugh's accusers have come forward at the last minute is seen by many Republicans - mostly male -  as a Democrat-inspired plot, not as a legitimate complaint.  The culture wars that have simmered in America for 50 years are finding an extraordinary flashpoint today - cultural conservatives versus Me Too. And in this battle, Judge Kavanaugh and the female complainants are just collateral damage. The reverberations of this hearing will echo for a long time to come.

 That brings us to the end of the first day of what will surely be several more days of hearings on the supreme court nomination of Brett Kavanaugh. The eight-hour hearing got off to an chaotic start. Senator John Cornyn, the second-ranking senate Republican, described the scene as mob rule as Democrats repeatedly angrily interrupted to demand that the Republican-majority delay the hearing until they have more time to read the documents released. The Republican chair, Chuck Grassley, dismissed the request and continued with the hearing. Outside the room, women wore the red robes worn in Margaret Atwoods Handmaids Tale to signify the threat they say Kavanaugh poses to womens rights. In total, the US Capitol police said they arrested 70 people for demonstrating during the hearing. Throughout the day, senators were repeatedly interrupted by protesters. In total, 70 protesters were arrested and removed from the room or the nearby premise.  In their opening remarks, Democrats sought to portray Kavanaugh as ideologue who is outside of the mainstream and will shift the balance supreme court sharply to the right. Republicans defended Kavanaughs record and accused Democrats of using scare tactics to gin up opposition to his nomination. Under oath, Kavanaugh vowed not to make decision based on personal and policy preferences and said: I am not a pro-prosecution or pro-defense judge. I am a pro-law judge. Tomorrow, senators will have their first opportunity to publicly questions Kavanaugh. Democrats are expected to aggressively press Kavanaugh on his views on abortion, same-sex marriage, gun control and executive power among other issues. Republicans are likely to defend Kavanaugh as a highly qualified nominee.  Updated

 Kavanaugh concludes his remarks: I am an optimist. I live on the sunrise side of the mountain, not the sunset side of the mountain. I see the day that is coming, not the day that is gone. I am optimistic about the future of America and the future of our independent Judiciary. I revere the Constitution. If confirmed to the Supreme Court, I will keep an open mind in every case. I will do equal right to the poor and to the rich. I will always strive to preserve the Constitution of the United States and the American Rule of Law.

 Kavanaugh becomes emotional as he thanks his friends for their support over the last several weeks. This past May, I delivered the commencement address at Catholic University Law School. I gave the graduates this advice: Cherish your friends. Look out for your friends. Lift up your friends. Love your friends.  Over the last 8 weeks, I have been strengthened by the love of my friends. I thank all my friends.  He is now introducing his daughters. He said both will be in and out of the hearing room over the next few days. Margaret has gotten her braces off and turned 13, he says. Of Liza, he says, no one gives a better hug.  He says his wife is a strong West Texan who is now the popular town manager of our local community.  This has not exactly been the summer she had planned for our family. I am grateful for her love and inspiration, he says.

 Kavanaugh calls his mother one of his judicial heroes and said he still turns to her trademark line: Use your common sense. What rings true? What rings false? His remarks seems focused on responding to attacks that he would roll back civil rights and criticism that his conformation would threaten protections for women, people of color, LGBTQ people and the poor.  I vividly remember days as a young boy sitting in the back of my moms classroom as she taught American history to a class of African-American teenagers. Her students were born before Brown versus Board of Education or Bolling versus Sharpe. By her example, my mom taught me the importance of equality for all Americansequal rights, equal dignity, and equal justice under law.  He says a Supreme Court justice must play the role of an umpire a neutral and impartial arbiter who favors no litigant or policy.  Over the past 12 years, I have ruled sometimes for the prosecution and sometimes for criminal defendants, sometimes for workers and sometimes for businesses, sometimes for environmentalists and sometimes for coal miners. In each case, I have followed the law. I dont decide cases based on personal or policy preferences. I am not a pro-plaintiff or pro-defendant judge. I am not a pro-prosecution or pro-defense judge. I am a pro-law judge. Updated

 After praising the Senate and the president, Kavanaugh moves into the meat of his opening statement.  As a nominee to the Supreme Court, I understand the responsibility I bear. Some 30 years ago, Judge Anthony Kennedy sat in this seat. He became one of the most consequential Justices in American history. I served as his law clerk in 1993. To me, Justice Kennedy is a mentor, a friend, and a hero. As a Member of the Court, he was a model of civility and collegiality. He fiercely defended the independence of the Judiciary. And he was a champion of liberty. If you had to sum up Justice Kennedys entire career in one word  liberty. Justice Kennedy established a legacy of liberty for ourselves and our posterity.

Kavanaugh is guided by the constitution and rule of law, Portman says, and he believes that justices shouldnt legislate from the bench. I know the man, he does things because its the right thing to do, Portman says. As evidence, he told the senators that after meeting in his senate office, Kavanaugh went to serve the homeless later that evening.

 Sen. Kamala Harris, a Democrat of California and a possible 2020 contender, is unsparring in her remarks.  Harris said nominating someone to the Supreme Court is personal because when we talk about our nations highest court and the men and women who sit on it, were talking about the impact that one individual on that court can have. She continued: I am concerned your loyalty would be to the president who appointed you and not to the constitution. Harris announced her opposition to Kavanaugh in early July.  The first-term senator has distinguished herself on the committee for her aggressive approach to questioning the presidents cabinet and judicial nominees.

Here is why it matters:",center,text,2018-09-05T10:03:05Z,reuters,Reuters,"3 Min Read WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. senators on Wednesday are set to probe Brett Kavanaugh, President Donald Trumps nominee to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court, over his views on abortion as his confirmation hearing moves into its second day. Here is why it matters:  What is Roe v. Wade?  Roe v. Wade is a landmark U.S. Supreme Court ruling from 1973 that found women have a constitutional right to obtain abortions. The ruling meant that states could not ban abortions, leading to an immediate and sustained backlash from social conservatives that continues to this day.   Why is abortion a key issue in the confirmation hearing?  Kavanaugh could potentially be the deciding vote on overturning the 1973 decision. The court is currently split 4-4 on ideological lines. Justice Anthony Kennedy, a conservative whom Kavanaugh would replace, disappointed conservatives by backing abortion rights in two key cases. Conservatives hope Kavanaugh will seal a majority that would at least be willing to curb abortion rights if not overturn Roe.  What is stare decisis?  Senators are likely to question Kavanaugh in detail on his willingness to question long-standing Supreme Court precedents.  The justices are generally reluctant to overturn precedent, citing a legal doctrine - known as stare decisis - that counsels against it in order to help the court stay evenhanded and appear less politicized.  But the court does overturn its precedents. In June, the conservative majority did so in a major labor case, ditching a 1977 ruling that non-union members could be required to make payments to unions to pay for collective bargaining representation.  What has Kavanaugh said about stare decisis?  At a 2016 event at the American Enterprise Institute, Kavanaugh said: Its appropriate that the court overrule precedent in some circumstances. But he expressed frustration about the lack of a neutral formula for determining when a case should be nixed.   The hard question is when is it appropriate and when is it not. I would love to have a perfect answer to that question, he said. Kavanaugh was not specifically asked about Roe v. Wade.  What is Kavanaughs record on abortion?  During his decade as a judge, Kavanaugh has not ruled directly on abortion but has signaled sympathy for legal arguments made by anti-abortion advocates.  Last October, he was on a panel of judges that issued an order preventing a 17-year-old illegal immigrant detained in Texas by U.S. authorities from immediately obtaining an abortion. That decision was overturned by the full appeals court and she had the abortion.  In a 2017 speech, Kavanaugh praised several opinions written by former Chief Justice William Rehnquist, including his dissent in Roe v. Wade.

Kyl, 76, was sworn in as the new senator from the southwestern state of Arizona in a brief ceremony on the Senate floor. Vice President Mike Pence, who also serves as president of the Senate, administered the oath.  In replacing McCain, a maverick who at times went against his party, Kyl is expected to bring a somewhat more conservative political viewpoint to the Senate, which is controlled by Republicans. They hold 51 seats with 47 Democrats and two independents who align with Democrats - unchanged from when McCain held the seat.  McCain died on Aug. 25 after being diagnosed last year with brain cancer. He was buried on Sunday following tributes in both Arizona and Washington.  Senate Judiciary Committee hearings began on Tuesday to consider President Donald Trumps nomination of Kavanaugh to fill a vacant U.S. Supreme Court seat. Kyl, as a private citizen, had been helping usher Kavanaughs nomination through the Senate.  A full Senate vote on Kavanaugh could come later this month.  Kyl likely will give Republicans a little more of a cushion in what is expected to be a close vote, given Democratic opposition.  Kyl, who had been working as a lobbyist at the law firm Covington & Burling, had a previous stint as senator, rising to serve in Republican leadership before retiring in 2013.  He has great judgment, an even keel, hes a team player, a true friend and an inspiring example of what a senator can and should be, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said of Kyl shortly before the swearing-in.  Kyl was appointed on Tuesday by Arizona Governor Doug Ducey, also a Republican, to temporarily fill McCains seat.  In a news conference on Tuesday, Kyl said he would not be a candidate in a special election in 2020 to finish McCains term that ends in January, 2023.

Kavanaugh, nominated by President Donald Trump, worked in the White House under former President George W. Bush, whose lawyers combed through documents from that time and decided that 27,000 of them were protected under constitutional privilege.  The White House directed them not to hand them over to the Senate Judiciary Committee, one of Bushs lawyers said in a letter to the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which will host the hearings scheduled to start on Tuesday.  Another 102,000 pages of documents related to Kavanaughs record were not turned over for other reasons. The committee has had access to more than 415,000 pages on Kavanaughs background, the lawyer said in the letter.  Dick Durbin, the No. 2 Senate Democrat, said in an interview aired on Fox News Sunday that the White Houses citation of privilege on the documents was the first time that had occurred.  There has been more concealment of documents that are concerning his public service and his position on issues than ever in the history of the United States ... If hes so proud of his conservative credentials, show us the record, Durbin said.  Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Judiciary Committee member, echoed Durbins concerns in an interview with NBCs Meet the Press on Sunday, saying, This is not normal.  Republicans have dismissed Democrats concerns over lack of access to portions of the record on Kavanaughs background, arguing their criticism is politically motivated.  Democrats have more than enough information to understand that this is a highly qualified jurist that should be the next Supreme Court justice, Wisconsin U.S. Senator Ron Johnson, a Republican, said in an interview on ABCs This Week.   Trump nominated Kavanaugh to be a justice on the U.S. Supreme Court to replace the retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy on July 9.   Kavanaugh must win a majority of the 100-seat Senate to approve his nomination. Most Republicans, who hold a slim majority in the chamber, are expected to back him.

The Times said an unknown person provided several confidential emails to the newspaper late on Wednesday relating to Kavanaughs work in the White House under Republican former President George W. Bush. A lawyer for Bush previously turned over thousands of documents to the Senate Judiciary Committee that the Republican-led panel deemed committee confidential, meaning they could not be made public or discussed during Kavanaughs confirmation hearing this week.  Some liberal critics have expressed concern that Kavanaugh, if confirmed by the Senate, could provide the decisive fifth vote on the nine-member high court to overturn the 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling legalizing abortion nationwide.  In one document cited by the Times, Kavanaugh suggested striking a line from a draft opinion piece that had stated it is widely accepted by legal scholars across the board that Roe v. Wade and its progeny are the settled law of the land, saying that the Supreme Court could overturn it.  During his confirmation hearing on Wednesday, Kavanaugh addressed the Roe decision, calling it an important precedent of the Supreme Court that has been reaffirmed many times. He also highlighted the 1992 Planned Parenthood v. Casey ruling that reaffirmed Roe, calling it a precedent on precedent.  The Times also reported that Kavanaugh wrote in another document that some U.S. Transportation Department affirmative action regulations used a lot of legalisms and disguises to mask what is a naked racial set-aside, the Times reported.  Affirmative action refers to policies that favor groups like racial minorities in practices such as hiring that have experienced past discrimination.

Christine Blasey Ford's attorney told CNN her client has been ""deflecting death threats and harassment"". Lawyer Lisa Banks said before her client goes to Congress, she wants an FBI investigation into Judge Kavanaugh. The nominee, who denies the claim, has met officials at the White House for a second day. Prof Ford, a psychology lecturer in California, has accused Judge Kavanaugh of drunkenly trying to remove her clothing in 1982 when they were both teenagers in a Washington DC suburb.  She says he pinned her to a bed and clamped his hand over her mouth when she attempted to scream. Judge Kavanaugh, 53, has called the allegation ""completely false"". Prof Ford's legal team say they have written to the Senate Judiciary Committee declining its offer to testify. Her lawyer told CNN on Tuesday night: ""It's premature to talk about a hearing on Monday because she [Prof Ford] has been dealing with the threats, the harassment and the safety of her family and that's what she's been focused on for the last couple of days."" She said that since going public with her allegation in the Washington Post on Sunday, Prof Ford has been trying to work out where her family are going to sleep at night. The legal team's letter says that Prof Ford's family has been forced to move out of their home, her email has been hacked and she has been impersonated online. The correspondence says ""a full investigation by law enforcement officials will ensure that the crucial facts and witnesses in this matter are assessed in a non-partisan manner, and that the Committee is fully informed before conducting any hearing or making any decisions"". Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley later said that there was no reason to delay Prof Ford's testimony as the aim would be to establish ""her personal knowledge and memory of events"". ""Nothing the FBI or any other investigator does would have any bearing on what Dr Ford tells the committee,"" he said in a statement. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, of South Carolina, said that if Prof Ford did not appear to testify on Monday, ""we are going to move on and vote [on the nominee for the Supreme Court] on Wednesday"". ""They've had tons of time to do this,"" he said, adding: ""This has been a drive-by shooting when it comes to Kavanaugh, I'll listen to the lady, but we're going to bring this to a close."" Senator Rob Portman, a Republican from Ohio, said the process was ""very unfair"" and that he did not blame Prof Ford, instead blaming ""Democrats who misused this process"".  Chuck Schumer, the top Senate Democrat, said he supported the call for an FBI investigation prior to the hearing.  In a statement he urged Senate Republicans and the White House to ""drop their inexplicable opposition"" to it and ""allow all facts to come out"".  Hawaii Democrat Mazie Hirono said ""the men in this country"" should ""just shut up"".  ""Not only do women like Dr Ford, who bravely comes forward, need to be heard, but they need to be believed,"" she told a press conference. Separately, the FBI declined to comment after the letter was made public on Tuesday. US President Donald Trump, who reportedly did not meet Mr Kavanaugh on Tuesday, expressed sympathy for his nominee. ""I feel so badly for him that he's going through this, to be honest with you,"" the Republican president told a news conference. ""This is not a man that deserves this."" He added: ""Hopefully the woman will come forward, state her case. He will state his case before representatives of the United States Senate. And then they will vote."" Mr Trump also appeared to suggest that the controversy was being exploited by Democrats as lawmakers looked to delay the Supreme Court vote.  ""The Supreme Court is one of the main reasons I got elected President. I hope Republican voters, and others, are watching, and studying, the Democrats Playbook,"" he tweeted. Meanwhile Mark Judge, a friend of Judge Kavanaugh who Prof Ford says witnessed the alleged incident, has said he does not want to speak publicly about the matter. ""Brett Kavanaugh and I were friends in high school but I do not recall the party described in Dr Ford's letter,"" he is quoted as saying in a letter from his lawyer. Republicans control the Senate by only a narrow 51-49 margin, meaning any defections could scupper the Supreme Court nomination. That would set back President Trump's efforts to install more conservatives on the Supreme Court and broader US judiciary. If confirmed, Judge Kavanaugh, a conservative federal appeals court judge, would be expected to tilt the court's balance further to the right. The ugly confirmation battle could shake up the forthcoming mid-term elections. Democrats are hoping to wrest control of Congress from Mr Trump's fellow Republicans on 6 November, dealing a serious blow to the president's efforts to install more conservatives on the Supreme Court and broader US judiciary.

Kavanaugh to serve on the Supreme Court, Sen. Cory Booker announced that he would deliberately violate rules against releasing protected information  risking, in his own estimation, the loss of his position. Heres why he did so, what's likely to happen as a result  and why the moment wasn't quite what it seemed. At issue are documents provided to the committee before the hearings. (Kavanaugh must be evaluated by the committee before his nomination can be sent to the full Senate for confirmation.) Booker (D-N.J.) took issue with how and when some of those documents were released, including a set released after having been vetted by William Burck, an attorney for President George W. Bush. (Kavanaugh served in Bushs administration.) One of the documents included in the Burck-reviewed set was an email revealing the nominee's views on racial profiling  but because it had been deemed committee confidential after a review, Booker was not allowed to refer to it or ask Kavanaugh questions about it. Committee Chairman Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) established a process for review of that confidentiality, but Booker argued that the process was too cumbersome, perhaps deliberately, to allow him to make reference to the document in time. He explicitly criticized the withholding of the profiling document. The fact that there is nothing in that document thats personal information, theres nothing national-security-related, the fact that it was labeled as committee confidential exposes that this process, sir, is a bit of a sham, Booker said. We are holding back not only  not only holding back documents, labeling committee confidential, but not even giving us the time to review those documents, he continued. Im sure you can understand, sir, how it puts all of us in a very difficult situation when its not you . . . its somebody you have to go  then go back to a person named Bill Burck to decide if some document  who is an associate, who is an associate and colleague of the nominee  to figure out which documents are going to be released.  Its inappropriate to raise these in an open session before the committee, replied Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.). And I think our colleagues understand that, but, nevertheless, decided to go ahead anyway. So I just think its important that we remind one another that there are clear rules about the discussion of confidential material and that there can be consequences to the violations of those rules.  Cornyn said it was outrageous that an invocation of attorney-client privilege by a lawyer working for a president would not be respected by the Senate. I thought we were doing pretty well yesterday, he said, but things went off the rails, it looks like, last night.  Booker embraced the idea that he could face punishment for releasing the document anyway. No Senate rule accounts for Bill Burcks partisan review of the documents, Booker said in response to Cornyn. No Senate rule and no history of the Senate accounts for what is going on right now. Referring to Burck as a partisan operative, Booker argued that Burcks involvement undermined the process. He went further. Senator Cornyn made a very good point. I knowingly violated the rules that were put forth, Booker said. I come from a long line, as all of us do as Americans, of understanding what that kind of civil disobedience is, and I understand the consequences.  So I am, right now, before your process is finished, I am going to release the email about racial profiling, he said. And I understand that, that the penalty comes with potential ousting from the Senate. And if Senator Cornyn believes that I have violated Senate rules, I openly invite and accept the consequences of my team releasing that email right now.  He was releasing it, Booker said, to show that what was being withheld had nothing to do with national security. Instead, what Im releasing this document right now to show is we have a process here for a person  the highest office in the land, for a lifetime appointment  were rushing through this before me and my colleagues can even read or digest the information, Booker added. The documents were released. As it turns out, though, the documents Booker released had already been cleared by Burck. Whats more, in a statement to The Washington Post on Thursday afternoon, Burck noted that Booker knew the documents were no longer confidential. We cleared the documents last night shortly after Senator Bookers staff asked us to, he said. We were surprised to learn about Senator Bookers histrionics this morning because we had already told him he could use the documents publicly. In fact, we have said yes to every request made by the Senate Democrats to make documents public.  Bookers office responded by criticizing the process  while acknowledging Burcks point about the documents. Note, though, that Cornyns and Bookers comments above refer to something that had already happened. Our colleagues  decided to go ahead anyway, he said, noting that things went off the rails last night. Booker, too, used the past tense  I knowingly violated the rules  before the release of the documents this morning. Thats a reference to Bookers having confronted Kavanaugh with the information in the racial-profiling emails on Wednesday night, as our Seung Min Kim reported. I have letters here, sir, that have asked for  now, the one email specifically entitled racial profiling that somehow  I mean, literally the email was entitled racial profiling, that somehow was designated as something that the public couldnt see, Booker said at that point. The email was, at that point, still confidential and therefore Booker shouldn't have referred to it. Cory said this morning that he was releasing committee confidential documents, and thats exactly what hes done. Last night, he was admonished by Republicans for breaking the rules when he read from committee confidential documents. Cory and Senate Democrats were able to shame the committee into agreeing to make last nights documents publicly available, and Cory publicly released those documents as well as other committee confidential documents today, read a statement from Booker spokeswoman Kristin Lynch that was provided to The Post on Thursday. Cornyns office confirmed this timeline to the Daily Beast, though the senator didn't point that clearance out during the hearing. In the moment, Cornyn, too, made a political point. Running for president is no excuse for violating the rules of the Senate or of the confidentiality of the documents that we are privy to, Cornyn said in response, highlighting Bookers broadly acknowledged future ambitions. Booker releasing the information was no different from releasing classified information, Cornyn said. No senator deserves to sit on this committee  or serve in the Senate, in my view  if they decide to be a law unto themselves and willingly flout the rules of the Senate and the determination of confidentiality and classification, he added. That is irresponsible and conduct unbecoming a senator.  After this exchange, White House principal deputy press secretary Raj Shah tweeted a reference to the rules of the Senate, rules that Cornyn read during the hearing: Any Senator . . . who shall disclose the secret or confidential business or proceedings of the Senate, including the business and proceedings of the committees, subcommittees and offices of the Senate, shall be liable, if a Senator, to suffer expulsion from the body.  During the hearing, Booker colleagues Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) and Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) joined him, saying they would take similar actions and accept the same punishments. Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) tweeted his support. Lets jump into this pit together, Durbin said. Hirono tweeted out documents stamped with committee confidential.  If he is not a tempest in a teapot, but sincerely believes that, then bring the charges, Booker said later, referring to Cornyn. I hope that they will bring charges against us, he added, and I am ready to accept the full responsibility for what I have done, the consequences for what I have done, and I stand by the public's right to have access to this document and know this nominee's views on issues that are so profoundly important, like race and the law, torture and other issues.  This is mostly political melodrama. No senator has been expelled from that body since 1862, and most of the 15 who have been expelled were ousted for expressing support for the Confederacy. Most of the more recent inquiries into expelling members have resulted in either no action or resignations. Those were for more-traditional offenses: fraud, corruption, abuse of power. Put another way, Booker  and the handful of colleagues who joined his act of civil disobedience  will almost certainly not face expulsion. They may very well face some form of punishment, such as censure, but the likelihood of removal is very low. The melodrama that played out Thursday that focused on the release of the already-cleared documents was itself the point. Expulsion is the most serious consequence a senator can face, and few do. The net result is that Booker got what he wanted  release of information he saw as incriminating  with the most likely result even if he had violated the rules being the equivalent of a write-up from your boss. And, as Cornyn pointedly noted, Booker's stock with a Democratic base champing at the bit for partisan confrontation gained a few points. It may run contrary to how the Senate has traditionally operated, but its very much in line with how politics operates in 2018. This article was updated with the statements from Burck and Booker's office and throughout to reflect the new information.","Cory Booker's Senate rules drama, explained - Washington Post",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/09/06/cory-bookers-dramatic-violation-senate-rules-explained/,https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/J_l-tyr_rcdL8xAnf70Oh7s7y6g=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NFVA4WVR4YI6RC2TKAIWO2HETE.jpg,5

The new claim, which is being investigated by the Senate, alleges Judge Kavanaugh committed serious sexual assault in high school. In a statement, the judge said he did not know the accuser, Julie Swetnick, and her allegations ""never happened"". He is set to testify on Thursday over other sexual misconduct claims. In a sworn affidavit, Ms Swetnick alleged that Judge Kavanaugh was involved in the drugging and sexual assault of girls at house parties in the 1980s.  She says she was the victim of a gang rape in 1982 at a party attended by the judge.  Ms Swetnick is represented by lawyer Michael Avenatti, who has declared his ambition to run for president as a Democrat in 2020. His most famous client is porn actress Stormy Daniels, who says she had an affair with President Donald Trump. Lawyers for the Senate Judiciary Committee say they are reviewing Ms Swetnick's testimony. Mr Avenatti has said his client is willing to testify before the panel. It comes just a day before the first accuser to come forward, Christine Blasey Ford, is due to outline allegations of sexual assault by Brett Kavanaugh at a high school party more than 30 years ago.  Another woman, Deborah Ramirez, a former Yale University classmate, has said that the nominee once exposed himself to her at a dormitory party in the 1980s. But the third allegation is more serious than the other two.  ""This is ridiculous and from the Twilight Zone,"" Judge Kavanaugh said in a statement shared by the White House on Wednesday, referring to the science fiction television series.   ""I don't know who this is and this never happened."" The president responded to the new claims, calling Mr Avenatti a ""third-rate lawyer who is good at making false accusations"" and a ""lowlife"". Avenatti is a third rate lawyer who is good at making false accusations, like he did on me and like he is now doing on Judge Brett Kavanaugh. He is just looking for attention and doesnt want people to look at his past record and relationships - a total low-life! End of Twitter post  by @realDonaldTrump In a meeting with the Japanese Prime Minister later on Wednesday, he told reporters: ""I think it ridiculous. It's a con game that they're playing. ""He's a high-quality person. They're bringing people out of the woods. They could do it to anybody. ""It's a horrible con game. I think the people are finding it out. And hopefully over the next couple of days it will be settled up and solved and we will have a Supreme Court justice who will go down as one of our greatest ever."" Julie Swetnick is a Washington DC resident who has spent her career working for the US federal government, including the US Department of Treasury, the US Mint and the Internal Revenue Service, according to her sworn affidavit. In the legal document released on Wednesday, Ms Swetnick notes she holds several active clearances related to her work for the US government. She says she attended high school in Gaithersburg, Maryland, and has received university degrees from Montgomery College and the University of Maryland. Her lawyer, Mr Avenatti, called her ""courageous, brave and honest"", and appealed for privacy for her and her family. Ms Swetnick's affidavit alleges: All 10 Democratic members of Senate Judiciary Committee have called on President Trump to ""immediately withdraw"" Judge Kavanaugh. The panel chairman, Chuck Grassley, has left open the possibility that its members may not vote on the nomination by the end of the week. ""It could take place Friday, or it could not,"" he told reporters in a conference call, reports the Des Moines Register. ""That kind of depends on what happens tomorrow."" But Republican Senator Lindsey Graham tweeted: ""I have a difficult time believing any person would continue to go to - according to the affidavit - 10 parties over a two-year period where women were routinely gang raped and not report it."" The White House on Wednesday released a letter sent to the panel signed by 60 of Judge Kavanaugh's classmates refuting Ms Swetnick's allegations. ""We never witnessed any behaviour that even approaches what is described in this allegation,"" the letter reads. ""These shameful attacks must end. This process is a disgrace and is harming good people."" The letter also states that these peers from Georgetown Prep and its sister schools never witnessed any misconduct on Judge Kavanaugh's part and never met someone named Julie Swetnick. The latest allegation makes Thursday's testimony make or break for the would-be Supreme Court justice. He will give evidence followed by his first accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, a California psychology professor.  The Senate Judiciary Committee shared Judge Kavanaugh's prepared testimony on the eve of the hearing - before the third allegation emerged. In his statement, the judge will call sexual assault ""horrific"", adding: ""I have never sexually assaulted anyone - not in high school, not in college, not ever. ""The allegation of misconduct is completely inconsistent with the rest of my life. I have always promoted the equality and dignity of women."" Republicans have hired a female lawyer who specialises in sex crimes to question Prof Ford during the hearing. On Wednesday, she submitted affidavits from four people - including her husband - swearing ""under the penalties of perjury"" that she had detailed her allegations about Judge Kavanaugh to them starting as early as 2013. On Wednesday, her lawyers released the results of a polygraph test she took - attesting that she is telling the truth -  after Republicans questioned why she had not yet shared it.  Judge Kavanaugh has also shared his high school calendar from the summer of 1982 with the Senate committee as supporting evidence that he did not attend a Maryland party during that time as Prof Ford alleges.

Kavanaughs confirmation hearings this week, with a pair of prospective Democratic candidates going to extraordinary lengths to demonstrate their opposition to President Trumps Supreme Court nominee. Sen. Cory Booker (N.J.) on Thursday portrayed himself as a rebel willing to face expulsion from the Senate for releasing confidential documents from Kavanaugh, describing it as his I am Spartacus moment. In reality, the documents had already been cleared for release. Sen. Kamala D. Harris (Calif.) hinted that she might have hard evidence that Kavanaugh spoke about the special counsel investigation with someone at the law firm founded by Trumps personal attorney. But she offered no such details when pressed. Booker and Harris, two of the Democratic Partys most prominent African Americans, took the headline-grabbing but shaky steps to put their opposition to Trump and Kavanaugh on full display for the country. The jockeying by the two came amid a clamor by a liberal base demanding resistance to Trumps agenda and nominees at all costs and under a glaring national spotlight exposing every stumble. At the same time, the bare-knuckle brawling has divided Democrats, frustrating moderates facing tough reelection bids in states Trump won handily. Its not who I am, said Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.), who observed the questioning by Democrats and Republicans at the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing and has indicated he is open to voting for Kavanaugh. The presidential ambitions of several Senate Democrats could cost the party in Novembers midterm elections, with 10 Democrats fighting for reelection in states won by Trump. Republicans seized on Bookers actions, with Sen. John Cornyn (Tex.) accusing him of making himself a martyr in aid of his presidential campaign and the GOP mocking him as the Spartacus of Newark. In July, Republicans pounced on Bookers statement that supporters of Kavanaugh are complicit in evil. Despite the actions of Booker, Harris and dozens of protesters who have repeatedly disrupted the hearings, Democratic hopes of defeating Kavanaugh have all but faded completely. Activists have so far failed to convince pivotal centrist senators to oppose him and encountered difficulties around the country in motivating people to pressure them. As a result, Kavanaugh is in strong position to be confirmed later this month as Republicans hold a 51-49 advantage. In fact, while committee Democrats were challenging Kavanaugh, the Senate confirmed eight district judges on Thursday, giving Trump 41 since he took office plus 26 appellate judges and Supreme Court Justice Neil M. Gorsuch. [With little fanfare, Trump and McConnell reshape the nations circuit courts] But for Booker and Harris, the fight for 2020 is just beginning. Both are experiencing their first Supreme Court nomination hearings as members of the Judiciary Committee. Clearly, if Ive already been threatened with expulsion, Im willing to go into every means, Booker told reporters on Thursday, wearing the Republican hostility as a badge of honor. The fireworks that erupted Wednesday night when Booker and Harris first grilled Kavanaugh lit up the cavernous hearing room again when the Judiciary Committee resumed business Thursday morning. Booker lambasted the panels procedure of keeping many Kavanaugh documents private as a sham with little merit and said he was releasing some, despite the dire consequences he could face for doing so. Bring it on! he said. Cornyn, the second-ranking Republican senator and a fellow member of the Judiciary panel, accused Booker during the hearing of prioritizing his national ambitions. Running for president is no excuse for violating the rules of the Senate or of the confidentiality of the documents that we are privy to, he said. But the records that Booker posted on his website Thursday morning had already been cleared for public release, according to Democratic and Republican aides on the committee. Pressed by reporters about whether he was told the documents that he mentioned Thursday morning were approved for release, Booker said he read in Wednesdays session from committee confidential documents in violation of the rule. He said he was continuing to release confidential documents and did so during the day. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said in a Friday interview with radio host Hugh Hewitt that Booker could face scrutiny from the Senate Ethics Committee. On Wednesday, Booker cited an email Kavanaugh had written that touched on the issue of race and pressed him to clarify his position on government efforts to promote diversity. Sitting next to Harris on the dais, Booker spoke frequently during his exchange with Kavanaugh, often overshadowing the judges comments with his own. At one point, Booker mentioned voting rights in South Carolina, a crucial early primary state. This Kavanaugh nomination is of paramount importance, said Scott Brennan, a Democratic National Committee member from Iowa. Those who acquit themselves well as part of that can enhance their credibility. Harriss tense exchange late Wednesday with Kavanaugh centered on special counsel Robert S. Mueller IIIs probe into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and possible links to the Trump campaign. A C-SPAN video posted of the nearly eight-minute back and forth on Twitter Wednesday evening was viewed nearly 4.8 million times by early Thursday afternoon. Harris repeatedly asked Kavanaugh whether he talked about Mueller or his probe with anyone at the law firm founded by Trumps personal lawyer, Marc Kasowitz. Kavanaugh said he didnt remember and wasnt sure he knew everyone who works at the law firm. On Thursday, Harris asked him once more, saying this time that she had received reliable information that he had had such a conversation. Im not asking you, What did you say. Im asking, Were you party to a conversation about the Mueller inquiry. Kavanaugh said no. A spokesman for law firm Kasowitz Benson Torres said in a statement that no discussions regarding the probe had occurred between Judge Kavanaugh and anyone at our firm. Under questioning earlier on Thursday, Kavanaugh said he knew Ed McNally, who used to work at the White House Counsels Office and is now at the firm. Kavanaugh said he had not discussed the special counsels probe with McNally, and the law firm said in a statement that McNally did not help Kavanaugh for his confirmation hearings and has not discussed with Judge Kavanaugh the Mueller probe or answers he might get related to the legal questions raised by the probe. Democratic senators have felt intense pressure from activists to vigorously fight Kavanaughs nomination. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (Calif.), the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, apologized to Kavanaugh for the protesters in the room this week. That prompted criticism from Brian Fallon, the head of an anti-Kavanaugh group, Demand Justice, who called it ridiculous. Separately, a collection of liberal groups sent Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) a letter chastising him for not pressuring all Democratic senators to oppose Kavanaugh. The Supreme Court is on the line, and you are failing us, they wrote. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), another possible White House contender who sits on the Judiciary Committee, has questioned Kavanaugh on issues that have resonated with party activists, including presidential power and health care. The blunt questions Democrats have asked Kavanaugh on the most explosive political, cultural and legal battles of Trumps tenure highlight the emerging themes of the campaign, which could be one of the most wide open and crowded in recent memory. Beyond the Judiciary Committee, other potential presidential candidates in the Senate have spoken out sharply against Kavanaugh this week. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has been tweeting with the hashtag #StopKavanaugh. In one tweet, she included a video listing five reasons to vote against him. This is a wake-up call for all of us and for the country, said Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), speaking of Kavanaughs nomination. Gillibrand said she would of course vote against Kavanaugh and urged people to pressure other senators to do the same. Several of the potential White House candidates sent emails to supporters about their opposition to Kavanaugh this week, urging them to sign a petition and provide their contact information or donate money. As for Booker and Harris, Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) told reporters he was fine with their line of questions  for the most part. It may be nice if they would have stopped at the end of their time limit, he said.  Seung Min Kim contributed to this report.

Sen. Cory B…,right,text,2018-09-07T04:19:34Z,business-insider,Business Insider,"  Democratic senators kept the heat on Judge Brett Kavanaugh on the third day of his Senate confirmation hearings, asking pointed questions about his leanings on  women's rights,  racial profiling, and the potential role he could play if a case related to the Russia investigation reaches the Supreme Court.   Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey asked Kavanaugh whether he would recuse himself from a case involving the special counsel Robert Mueller or the Russia probe if the nation's high court takes up the matter.   The issue has been on the minds of Democratic senators who have expressed concerns about Kavanaugh's views on executive branch powers. The Supreme Court could weigh in on  a number of potential scenarios that could play out in the Russia probe or the obstruction of justice case involving Trump in the near term.   ""Even at the jeopardy of President Trump pulling back your nomination, why not now alleviate all of that suspicion that a reasonable person might have?"" Booker asked Kavanaugh.   Kavanaugh chose not to take a position on recusal because, in his view, making such a decision beforehand would jeopardize the impartiality of the court.   Notably, the US attorney general Jeff Sessions recused himself from the Russia probe in March 2017, citing his previous contacts with Russian officials during the 2016 election.   Kavanaugh demurred on the issue: ""If I committed to deciding a particular case ... all I would be doing is demonstrating that I don't have the independence of the judiciary. That is necessary to be a good judge.""   The Supreme Court nominee had a similar response to California Sen. Kamala Harris, who asked him on Thursday to address concerns about his ability to remain impartial in judicial matters related to Trump. To that, Kavanaugh insisted that his record as a judge speaks for him.   ""My independence, I believe, has been demonstrated by my 12-year record,"" Kavanaugh said. He repeated that he firmly adheres to those principles.                                                                                                                       When Harris took up the recusal question Sen. Booker asked previously, Kavanaugh said, ""the independence of the judiciary requires that I not commit"" to participating or not participating in a case.   Harris and Kavanaugh crossed swords one day earlier  when she cornered him on a question about whether he had spoken about the Russia probe or Mueller with anyone at the law firm of Trump's personal lawyer, Marc Kasowitz.

But after two marathon days in the witness chair in a Senate hearing room, Kavanaugh appeared to be on a path to confirmation as a Supreme Court justice.   The 53-year-old appellate judge stuck to a well-rehearsed script throughout his testimony, providing only glimpses of his judicial stances while avoiding any serious mistakes that might jeopardize his confirmation. In what almost seemed like a celebration Thursday, Kavanaugh's two daughters returned to the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing room for the final hours of testimony, accompanied by teammates on Catholic school basketball teams their father has coached.   Senators will return for a final hearing day on Friday along with more than two dozen witnesses on both sides of the nomination fight. Democratic witnesses include John Dean, Richard Nixon's White House counsel who cooperated with prosecutors during the Watergate investigation, and Rochelle Garza, the legal guardian for the pregnant immigrant teenager whose quest for an abortion Kavanaugh would have delayed last year.   On the Republican side, former solicitors general Theodore Olson and Paul Clement will testify in support of the nominee, along with former students, law clerks and the mother of a basketball player Kavanaugh coached.   Campaigning in Montana Thursday night, Trump sought to elevate Kavanaugh's confirmation as a political litmus test for voters, saying the judge deserves bipartisan support and criticizing the ""anger and the meanness on the other side  it's sick.""   Abortion was a focus throughout Kavanaugh's two days of testimony. The Democrats' best shot at stopping Kavanaugh  who could swing the court further to the right for decades  would be branding him as a justice who might vote to overturn the court's landmark Roe v. Wade ruling. Their hope is that two Republican senators who support abortion rights could break from their party and vote against him.   A newly disclosed email suggested Kavanaugh once indicated the abortion case was not settled law, though Kavanaugh denied in the hearing that he had been expressing his personal views.   The tone in the email from 2003 contrasted with his responses to questions on Wednesday when he stressed how difficult it is to overturn precedents like Roe. In the email, Kavanaugh was reviewing a potential op-ed article in support of two judicial nominees while he was working at the George W. Bush White House. The document had been held by the committee as confidential, but was made public Thursday.   ""I am not sure that all legal scholars refer to Roe as the settled law of the land at the Supreme Court level since Court can always overrule its precedent, and three current Justices on the Court would do so,"" Kavanaugh wrote, referring to justices at the time, in an email to a Republican Senate aide. The document was partially redacted.                                                               Asked about it by the committee's top Democrat, Dianne Feinstein of California, Kavanaugh reiterated his previous testimony that ""Roe v. Wade is an important precedent of the Supreme Court.""   Democrats also questioned Kavanaugh's ability to separate himself from Trump and special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation of Russia's meddling in the 2016 election. Throughout his testimony, Kavanaugh repeatedly stated the importance of judicial independence.   Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois put the focus on Trump, who Durbin said, ""has shown contempt for the federal judiciary and has shown disrespect for the rule of law over and over again.""   ""It's in the context of the Trump presidency that we ask you these questions,"" Durbin said.   Kavanaugh refused to answer questions about Trump or commit to stepping aside from any case about the Russia investigation that might come to the Supreme Court. When Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut invited him to denounce Trump's criticism of federal judges, including Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the nominee demurred.                                                               ""The way we stand up is by deciding cases and controversies independently without fear or favor,"" Kavanaugh said.   Earlier, he said his 12-year record as an appellate judge shows that he has not been afraid to invalidate executive branch actions. Kavanaugh said that he has made clear that a court order ""that requires a president to do something or prohibits a president from doing something ... is the final word in our system.""   On a separate track, Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont and Durbin led the charge in suggesting that Kavanaugh misled them in earlier testimony. He denied that allegation with the robust support of Senate Republicans.   Much of the debate among senators focused more on the disclosure of documents than on Kavanaugh's record. Democratic Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey  who along with Harris is a potential presidential candidate in 2020  said he was willing to risk fallout over releasing confidential documents about Kavanaugh's views on race. Republican John Cornyn of Texas warned him that senators could be expelled for violating confidentially rules. Democrats and Booker responded, ""Bring it on.""   In fact, some of the documents the Democrats wanted disclosed had been released hours earlier, in a pre-dawn disclosure approved by Bill Burck, the GOP attorney who serves as presidential records lawyer for Bush.                                                               The document battle stemmed from Kavanaugh's unusually long paper trail following his years in the Bush White House. The panel's process resulted in hundreds of thousands of pages of Kavanaugh's documents being withheld as confidential or kept from release under presidential privilege by the Trump White House.   Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, who released more documents Thursday, stood by his handling of the issue.   ""My process was fair,"" Grassley declared.   Republicans hope to confirm Kavanaugh in time for the first day of the new Supreme Court term, Oct. 1.

Judge Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who says he attacked her more than three decades ago, will both be able to testify. US President Donald Trump said earlier he expected ""a little delay"" to confirming his nominee. Judge Kavanaugh, 53, says the allegation is ""completely false"". He denies he was even at the 1982 high school party in question where his accuser, now a psychology professor in California, says he tried to rape her as his friend watched. The claim has jeopardised Judge Kavanaugh's formerly all-but certain-nomination for a lifetime job on the Supreme Court. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley confirmed next Monday's hearing in a statement. ""As I said earlier, anyone who comes forward as Dr Ford has done deserves to be heard,"" said the Iowa Republican. Mr Grassley had earlier stopped short of calling for a public hearing, or for delaying the committee's vote on the nominee. The judge last week finished four days of hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee, and a vote on his confirmation had been planned for Thursday of this week. But Democrats demanded a delay in the vote in order to let the FBI investigate. Mr Grassley said the standard procedure would be for committee members to conduct telephone calls with both witnesses about their forthcoming testimony. But in a statement, the panel's Democrats refused to join in any phone call with Judge Kavanaugh. Senators from both parties had argued that Judge Kavanaugh and Prof Ford should be given the chance to testify before the panel. Senator Susan Collins, a Maine Republican, told reporters she would like the chance to observe Prof Ford to decide the credibility of her account. ""Obviously, if Judge Kavanaugh has lied about what happened, that would be disqualifying,"" she said. Two other Republican senators, Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona, and Bob Corker of Tennessee, earlier called for the vote to be delayed. Prof Ford detailed her story in a letter sent to Senate Judiciary Committee senior Democrat Dianne Feinstein in July before going public in an article published in the Washington Post on Sunday. The Palo Alto University academic says the incident happened 36 years ago in a Maryland suburb outside Washington DC. Prof Ford says Brett Kavanaugh pinned her to a bed and tried to take off her clothes, then clamped his hand over her mouth when she attempted to scream. They were students in different high schools. She was 15 and he was 17. Both he and his friend, who allegedly watched the incident, were drunk, she says. Mark Judge, who has been named as the third person in the room, told The Weekly Standard the allegations were ""absolutely nuts"". Prof Ford says she spoke of the alleged attack a couple of times over the subsequent decades, including during therapy. In a statement on Monday, Judge Kavanaugh vowed to ""refute"" the accusation before the congressional panel. He said in a statement issued by the White House: ""I have never done anything like what the accuser describes - to her or to anyone. ""Because this never happened, I had no idea who was making this accusation until she identified herself yesterday."" Prof Ford's lawyer, Debra Katz, told NBC's Today programme on Monday that ""if it were not for the severe intoxication of Brett Kavanaugh, she [Prof Ford] would have been raped"". Republicans control the Senate by only a narrow 51-49 margin, meaning any defections could scupper the nomination. That would set back President Trump's efforts to install more conservatives on the Supreme Court and broader US judiciary. If confirmed, Judge Kavanaugh, a conservative federal appeals court judge, would be expected to tilt the court's balance further to the right. The confirmation fight comes just weeks before November's congressional elections in which Democrats are hoping to wrest control of Congress from Mr Trump's party. The Judicial Crisis Network, a conservative group that backs Mr Trump's judicial picks, says it plans to launch a $1.5m (1.1m) ad campaign backing Judge Kavanaugh. Mr Trump, who faces multiple accusations of sexual misconduct that surfaced during the 2016 presidential election campaign, has not offered an opinion on the credibility of Prof Ford's allegation. At the White House on Monday, the Republican president said of the confirmation: ""If it takes a little delay, it will take a little delay."" He dismissed as ""ridiculous"" a reporter's question about whether Judge Kavanaugh's nomination would be withdrawn. ""I think he's very much on track,"" Mr Trump said. The White House said in a statement: ""Judge Kavanaugh looks forward to a hearing where he can clear his name of this false allegation."" Brett Kavanaugh's nomination will go to a full US Senate vote but talks continue over an FBI inquiry. Is cutting out food groups a good idea?

Kavanaugh introduced the country  briefly  to the nominee, who pledged in his opening statement to be a neutral and impartial arbiter who favors no litigant or policy. On Wednesday, Kavanaugh gets what is expected to be a 12-hour grilling as the Senate Judiciary Committee questions him on a range of topics. Questions from members of the committee are expected to span the course of Kavanaughs long career in Washington  from his tenure as a member of independent counsel Kenneth W. Starrs team in the 1990s to the George W. Bush White House to the 12 years he has spent as a federal judge. Here are some of the issues most likely to arise: Should a sitting president be subject to civil suits and criminal investigation? Kavanaughs view that a sitting president should not be distracted by criminal investigations or civil lawsuits will be of great interest to Senate Democrats. Kavanaugh, who worked for Starr in the investigation of President Bill Clinton, expressed regret about the way the probe was conducted in a 2009 article he wrote for the Minnesota Law Review. While Kavanaugh wrote those words seven years before Donald Trump was elected president, that viewpoint could be relevant in light of special counsel Robert S. Mueller IIIs investigation into whether Trumps campaign coordinated with Russia in the 2016 campaign. If Kavanaugh is confirmed, he might be asked to rule on whether Mueller has the right to subpoena the president and compel his testimony. Members of Congress could press Kavanaugh on whether it would be a conflict of interest for him to participate in a decision about the president who nominated him to the court. Abortion Many who oppose Kavanaughs nomination do so on the grounds that he could be the pivotal vote to overturn Roe v. Wade, the 1973 case that established a womans right to end her pregnancy. In Kavanaughs meeting last month with Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), who supports abortion rights, Kavanaugh said the landmark decision is settled law. But in a subsequent meeting with Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), Kavanaugh would not answer whether he thought Roe had been correctly decided. Kavanaugh has had only one major abortion ruling, in a case last fall involving a pregnant migrant teenager in federal custody. A majority of Kavanaughs colleagues on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit ordered the Trump administration to allow the teen to end her pregnancy. In his dissent in Garza v. Hargan , Kavanaugh wrote that his colleagues had created a new right for unlawful immigrant minors in U.S. government detention to obtain immediate abortion on demand and that the court was shifting the law toward a radical extension of the Supreme Courts abortion jurisprudence. Kavanaugh did not go as far as another judge on the D.C. Circuit who said the teen had no constitutional right to an abortion. He also repeatedly referred in his opinion to the precedent set in Roe. The idea that Kavanaugh views Roe as settled does not necessarily mean he would oppose abortion restrictions. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., who also described Roe during his confirmation hearing as settled as precedent, has been a reliable vote in favor of such restrictions. Health care Senators on both sides of the aisle are likely to press Kavanaugh about his rulings related to President Barack Obamas health-care law, which Republicans tried unsuccessfully to repeal. The Justice Department has said it will not defend the Affordable Care Act against challenges from the states, and advocates of the law have warned that Kavanaughs addition to the high court could lead to a rollback of protections for people with preexisting medical conditions. Kavanaugh issued a dissent in 2011 when the D.C. Circuit upheld the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act in the case Seven-Sky v. Holder . But he was criticized by some conservatives for doing so on technical, jurisdictional grounds instead of declaring the law unconstitutional. Contraception Advocates for reproductive rights are concerned about the contraceptive-coverage requirement in the health-care law. In a 2015 case, Kavanaugh dissented from his colleagues and sided with the group Priests for Life, which argued that a provision to opt out for religious objections was too burdensome. But Kavanaugh was again criticized by some social conservatives for referring in his dissent to precedent that strongly suggests that the government has a compelling interest in facilitating access to contraception. The issue remains in court after the Trump administration last year issued new rules making it easier for employers to refuse to provide coverage for birth control on the basis of religious objections. Affirmative action in higher education Civil rights advocates and those opposed to racial preferences agree that Kavanaugh could be the vote on the high court that conservatives have been looking for to end affirmative action in college admissions. As a lawyer in private practice in 1999, Kavanaugh described a government program for Native Hawaiians as a naked racial-spoils system. He invoked the language of the late Justice Antonin Scalia, writing in a newspaper column that the Supreme Court would eventually find that in the eyes of the government, we are just one race. That view could apply to racial preferences in other areas such as housing and employment. Kavanaughs position is significant because of the person he was nominated to replace. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy was the deciding vote two years ago to uphold the University of Texass limited use of race as a factor in admissions. Admissions practices at Harvard and the University of North Carolina are facing legal challenges that could end up at the Supreme Court. In a legal brief filed in federal court last week, the Justice Department sharply criticized Harvard as engaging in racial balancing. Executive power Democrats have focused on Kavanaughs rulings in favor of broad presidential power and his criticism of the independent counsel law to suggest he would protect Trump from Muellers investigation. In a 2016 discussion at the American Enterprise Institute, Kavanaugh said he would put the final nail in the now-defunct independent counsel law. In his court opinions, Kavanaugh has called for restructuring the governments consumer watchdog agency so the president could remove the director and has been a leading defender of the governments position when it comes to using military commissions to prosecute terrorism suspects. Voting rights In 2012, Kavanaugh wrote the unanimous opinion for a three-judge panel that cleared new voter identification requirements in South Carolina. Kavanaughs opinion in South Carolina v. Holder acknowledged objections from Obamas Justice Department and civil rights groups about what they argued was the disproportionate impact of the law on black voters, who were less likely to have acceptable photo IDs. The opinion delayed implementation of the law for one year but ultimately allowed it to take effect. Civil rights advocates have said it is telling that Kavanaugh did not join the two other judges in a separate opinion in which they noted the vital role of the Voting Rights Act, which required federal oversight of election laws in states with a history of discrimination. The Supreme Court has since invalidated the provision, known as Section5. Knowledge of torture policy Questions about the rules governing detention of enemy combatants are likely to surface as they did during Kavanaughs 2006 confirmation hearing. The issue was raised previously because Kavanaugh worked as a White House associate counsel at the time that President Bush developed his policy on detention and interrogation of terrorism subjects. Kavanaugh testified then that he was not involved. Bushs interrogation policy was laid out in what became known as the torture memo, which said that using what were called enhanced interrogation techniques on terrorism suspects may be justified and that international laws against torture may not apply. The revelation of the interrogation policy prompted much protest, including from Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), and Kavanaugh testified that I do not agree with the legal analysis in the memorandum. Kavanaughs denial of knowledge about the policy later came into question when The Washington Post revealed a year later that he had participated in a meeting in the White House counsels office in which he had been asked his opinion about how Justice Anthony M. Kennedy  for whom he had clerked  was likely to view the matter. Some Democrats have said the revelation raises questions about the accuracy of his 2006 testimony, and they plan to ask him about it at the hearing. The Kenneth Starr years Kavanaugh played a significant role in the investigation into whether President Clinton lied when he denied in a civil lawsuit that he had a sexual relationship with intern Monica Lewinsky. In a 1998 memo, he proposed a list of questions that Clinton should be asked and made clear his disdain for Clintons actions. After reflecting this evening, I am strongly opposed to giving the President any break in the questioning regarding the details of the Lewinsky relationship unless he resigns or confesses perjury, Kavanaugh wrote. He has required the urgent attention of the courts and the Supreme Court for frivolous privilege claims  all to cover up his oral sex from an intern. He has lied to his aides. He has lied to the American people. He has tried to disgrace you and this Office with a sustained propaganda campaign that would make Nixon blush. Democrats may ask Kavanaugh whether he would apply the same standard of toughness against Trump in the Mueller probe, especially given that Kavanaugh has since said that a sitting president should not be subject to distracting investigations. Campaign finance laws In a 2011 decision, Kavanaugh upheld a federal law banning political donations from foreigners temporarily in the United States  barring them from contributing to political parties and groups or spending to advocate for or against candidates. His opinion did not rule out allowing foreigners to spend money on independent advocacy campaigns. A Russian company accused by Mueller of being part of an operation to disrupt the 2016 presidential campaign repeatedly cites Kavanaughs decision to argue that the charge should be thrown out. More broadly, Kavanaugh appears to fit the mold of Scalia, who joined the courts conservatives  Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel A. Alito Jr.  as skeptics of the constitutionality of many campaign finance restrictions. In 2010, Kavanaugh joined the D.C. Circuit majority in ruling in SpeechNow.org v. FEC that federal contribution limits cannot be applied to independent expenditure committees. And in 2009, he ruled against regulations in Emilys List v. FEC  that required independent nonprofit organizations to comply with federal contribution limits.  Robert Barnes contributed to this report.

Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) said Friday that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh was not truthful when he denied knowing that he had received documents that Leahy said had been stolen from him and other Democrats. Leahy said that emails disclosed during Kavanaughs nomination hearing this week buttress his case that Kavanaugh knew, or should have known, that he had received documents that Republican staffers took from a computer jointly shared with Democrats. There were numerous emails sent to him that made it very clear this was stolen information, including a draft letter from me, Leahy said in an interview. Kavanaugh, asked during this weeks hearing whether he ever suspected the material was taken from Democrats, responded, No. White House spokesman Raj Shah said in a statement that Leahys assertion shows just how desperate he is to smear Judge Kavanaughs stellar reputation. The allegation is one of several from Democrats who say Kavanaugh has not been completely forthcoming during his confirmation hearings, both for the federal bench years ago and during this weeks Supreme Court hearings. Though Kavanaugh this week referred to the decision legalizing abortion nationally as established precedent, recently released emails show that as a White House lawyer in 2003 he advised against referring to the ruling as settled law. Earlier this week, he clarified testimony from his 2004 confirmation hearing involving a controversial judge he helped shepherd through the nomination process. Leahys charge stems from an infamous episode between 2001 and 2003 when a Republican counsel on the Senate Judiciary Committee, Manuel Miranda, learned that Democrats on the panel had put documents on a computer server shared with Republicans. Miranda said in an interview that he read them to learn about the partys strategy on judicial nominations coming before the committee. At the time, Kavanaugh was associate counsel in the White House and was responsible for helping to vet judicial nominees who would appear before the Judiciary Committee. Miranda, now a private attorney in Maryland, said he worked closely with Kavanaugh on the nominations and may have shared information that he learned from the Democratic files. But he said that he never let Kavanaugh know he had seen documents taken from Democrats. I never told him that I got this from the Democrats. There was never anything like that, Miranda said. I can tell you for a fact that Brett didnt know, because no one knew aside from some other staffers. A congressional report blamed Miranda and another staffer for viewing the documents. Miranda said he was never charged in the matter and that he never considered his action to be hacking, as Leahy has described it. This weeks hearing was the latest effort by Leahy to suggest Kavanaugh knew he had received information improperly taken from Democrats. He questioned Kavanaugh about the matter in confirmation hearings in 2004, when Kavanaughs nomination for the federal appeals court was stalled, and in 2006, when Kavanaugh won confirmation. During both hearings, Kavanaugh said he learned about Mirandas action only from news reports, and Leahy did not have access to Kavanaughs emails. That changed at this weeks hearings, when the committee released a number of previously undisclosed emails that Leahy said raised new questions about Kavanaughs knowledge that the documents were improperly taken. In a July 28, 2002, email, Miranda wrote Kavanaugh that Leahys staff has distributed a confidential letter to Democratic staffers, and then described the contents of the letter. An email written by Miranda on March 18, 2003, and copied to Kavanaugh, had the subject line was for use and not distribution. Miranda wrote that Dem staffers say that they have confidential information, and he then listed points they make. Leahy said the points came from a draft of a letter written by his office. We have every reason to believe that was taken, Leahy said. Separately, an email written to Kavanaugh by a then-staffer to the Republican leadership, Barbara Ledeen, had the subject line spying. Ledeen wrote that I have a friend who is a mole for us on the left, and described information she had learned about spending plans by liberal groups on judicial nominations. It is important to note that IF we have a nominee, we need to ZIP THAT PERSON RIGHT THROUGH THE PROCESS....WE CANNOT BEAT 20 MILLION DOLLARS, Ledeen wrote on June 5, 2003.  Kavanaugh forwarded the message to his boss, Counsel Alberto Gonzales, and others, writing, interesting Ledeen email  Ledeen, who now serves as a Republican staffer on the committee, did not respond to a request for comment. Leahy cited the spying email during the hearing, asking Kavanaugh, None of this raised a red flag with you? It did not, Senator, Kavanaugh said.

As Kavanaugh sat silently with his family behind him, Democratic senators protested a lack of time to review the nominees voluminous records from his time in the George W. Bush Administration, the withholding of certain documents under executive privilege and the speed with which the committee was moving on confirmation. We are rushing through this process in a way that is unnecessary, said Democratic Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey. He and other senators spoke out of turn, as protesters with the liberal group Code Pink periodically jumped up and began shouting, leading to a chaotic opening to a week of hearings. We stand for reproductive rights, yelled one protester. Please vote no! yelled another. An illegitimate president cannot make a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court, yelled a third. Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley hadnt even finished his opening statement as order in the hearing broke down. Right before Grassley was slated to deliver it, the majority of Democrats on the committee, with the exception of ranking member Dianne Feinstein, moved to adjourn the hearing, arguing that the documents from Kavanaughs time in the Bush White House that the Senate had received Monday night was a cause for delay. Feinstein expressed her displeasure with the hearings in her opening statement but stayed out of the procedural fray. As the Democrats on the committee were making their requests, members of the public watching the hearing in the back of the room were voicing their own opposition and being led away. At least 15 protests interrupted the hearing during the first 45 minutes. One code pink protester held up a sign, that read ROE- YES KAVANA-NOPE, a reference to the 1973 landmark Supreme Court decision Roe v. Wade that upheld a womans constitutional right to an abortion. The entire time this was happening, Kavanaugh sat silently in the middle of the room, watching both senators and spectators denounce his nomination. As Grassley repeatedly tried to read his opening statement, Democrats again brought up their desire to adjourn the hearing. Grassley let them speak, but warned their efforts would ultimately be futile. Were going to not necessarily accommodate all obstruction, but if people have got something to say, this chairman is going to let them say it, Grassley said. But its pretty boring to hear the same thing all the time.

 Late-night hosts arrived back after a vacation to discuss the Nike controversy, supreme court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Bob Woodwards new book on Donald Trump. On Jimmy Kimmel Live! the host spoke about how people are ripping the Nike logo from socks. Finally something dumber than eating Tide pods, he remarked. He continued: Its a powerful statement that says: I have too many socks. Its the latest protest from Trump supporters against a company and Kimmel went on to sum them all up. Its kind of hilarious if you think about it, he sais. All of these guys who voted for Trump, now they cant watch the NFL, they cant ride Harleys, they have to burn their Nikes, they cant go to Starbucks or watch Netflix, they have to love Vladimir Putin and hate the FBI  I mean, if this was a practical joke, it would be one of the greatest practical jokes of all time. He added: Why not just burn your money? You already bought the clothes. On The Late Show, Stephen Colbert referred to events in the White House as historically crazy stuff before commenting that his initial wish to discuss what happened over the last fortnight in detail was curtailed at the last minute. It seems like an explosive book about the Trump White House comes out every few minutes, he said in reference to Bob Woodwards new book, Fear. Colbert joked that it is a book named after the emotion Trump feels after he sees a book. In Woodwards expos, he reveals many shocking details about Trumps presidency, including his repeated jabs at the attorney general, Jeff Sessions, who he apparently called a dumb southerner. Not all southerners are dumb, just the ones willing to work for you, Colbert said. On Late Night with Seth Meyers, the host spoke about the problematic nature of a president who is under investigation then trying to confirm a new supreme court justice. Its like Bonnie getting arrested and saying: You know whod make a great judge? Clyde, he joked. Meyers also spoke about Trumps attack on Sessions but this time referring to a tweet that criticized how two Republican candidates remain under investigation, blaming it on him. Trump tweeted that the Democrats must now love him for what he is doing. First of all, no one loves Jeff Sessions, Meyers said. He looks like a haunted doll that moves whenever you look away. Meyers continued to go into detail about how Brett Kavanaugh is being presented by both rightwing pundits and Republicans as a carpool dad. Anyone can drive a car! he said. Republicans are rushing to confirm the supreme court nominee of a president under criminal investigation whos trying to subvert the justice system to his own political ends so they can roll back voting rights, reproductive rights and workers rights to solidify their grip on power, and their only argument is that hes a carpool dad, he added. On The Daily Show, Trevor Noah spoke about Nikes new controversial campaign with Colin Kaepernick who appears next to the statement: Believe in something. Even if it means sacrificing everything. To all the people burning Nikes: Nike already has your money.Full piece: https://t.co/9kho7igkXO pic.twitter.com/2ZeFYNr5F7 Its also the motto of many gambling addicts, Noah joked.

John Cornyn accused Booker of grandstanding as part of his suspected plans to run for president in 2020.   ""Running for president is no excuse for violating the rules of the Senate,"" Cornyn said. ""This is no different from the senator deciding to release classified information that is deemed classified.""   As Cornyn read the rules of expulsion to Booker, the New Jersey senator said, ""Bring it.""    Many of Booker's Democratic colleagues in the committee stood by him and said they'd join him in risking expulsion by releasing committee confidential documents.   The email that Booker said he would release is among thousand of documents handed over to the Senate Judiciary Committee by a lawyer for former President George W. Bush. The documents have been deemed committee confidential, which mean they cannot be made public.

US,right,text,2018-09-21T18:00:51Z,reuters,Reuters,"5 Min Read (Reuters) - President Donald Trumps nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S. Supreme Court is before a Senate committee that is struggling to advance it after a woman alleged Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when they were in high school in 1982.   Trump, dropping his earlier restraint, on Friday in Twitter posts impugned California professor Christine Blasey Fords accusations, raising the stakes for Republicans.  The full Senate must approve Kavanaugh and Republicans hold only a slim majority there. Most Democrats were expected to oppose the nominee.  As of yet, there are no clear signs of Republican defections but here are key senators to monitor ahead of any action.  * Jeff Flake. A frequent Trump critic who will retire from the Senate in January, Flake was complimentary toward Kavanaugh during his confirmation hearing earlier this month.  However, on Wednesday, after the presidents eldest son Donald Trump Jr. made light of Fords allegations on Instagram, Flake replied in a tweet, This is sickening. No one should make light of this situation, USA Today reported.  * Susan Collins. A moderate who sometimes breaks from party ranks, Collins earlier this week said she wants both Ford and Kavanaugh to testify under oath to the committee.  She told reporters that if Kavanaugh has lied about allegations of sexual misconduct, that would be disqualifying. It was still unclear on Friday whether Ford would testify.  After Kavanaughs confirmation hearing, Collins said generally positive things about him. In 2017, she voted to confirm Neil Gorsuch, Trumps first nomination to the court.  Collins told the Portland Press-Herald in Maine that she was appalled by Trumps tweets on Friday saying that if the attack on Ford had been as bad as she said, it would have been reported.  * Lisa Murkowski. Another occasional party renegade, she has promised to be rigorous in her review of Kavanaugh. She has not said how she will vote. Collins also backed Gorsuch.  * Dean Heller. Heller is the only Republican senator up for re-election on Nov. 6 whose state was won by Hillary Clinton in 2016 and he is seen as vulnerable in his race. Trump flew to Las Vegas in Hellers home state of Nevada on Thursday to campaign for him.  Heller said in a statement after meeting with Kavanaugh in July that had no reservations in confidently supporting him.  * Rand Paul. Another Republican maverick on some issues, Paul said in July he will support Kavanaugh.  * Bob Corker. He has clashed with Trump and is not running for re-election but he has described Kavanaugh as a superb nominee whom he plans to vote for. On Tuesday, he said in a tweet, If we dont hear from both sides on Monday, lets vote.  * Ben Sasse. Another senator who has clashed with Trump, Sasse has said he will vote for Kavanaugh.  * Heidi Heitkamp. Facing a re-election campaign in North Dakota, a heavily pro-Trump state, she was one of three Democrats who voted for Gorsuch. On Kavanaugh, she has called for further investigation of Fords allegations.  * Joe Manchin. Also up for re-election in the pro-Trump state of West Virginia, he says healthcare is his test of whether to support Kavanaugh, whose critics say will rule against Obamacare the first chance he gets on the Supreme Court. Manchin voted for Gorsuch.  * Joe Donnelly. Non-committal thus far on Kavanaugh, Donnelly, too, is up for re-election in the red-leaning state of Indiana. On Monday, he said the allegations against Kavanaugh serious and merit further review.  * Doug Jones. The first Democratic senator elected from Alabama in over 20 years, he must show he can be independent-minded to stay in office. The Kavanaugh vote could be a test.   * Jon Tester. He opposed Gorsuch but has not come down firmly on Kavanaugh.  * Bill Nelson. He has not stated explicitly whether he would vote for Kavanaugh but he said in a July fundraising email that Democrats need to stop Republicans plans to put another right-wing extremist on the Supreme Court. Nelson opposed Gorsuch.  Reporting By Richard Cowan, Amanda Becker and Lawrence Hurley; Editing by Kevin Drawbaugh and Bill Trott All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

Trump defended Kavanaugh, now a federal appeals court judge, at a New York news conference, but the presidents comments injected another note of uncertainty into Kavanaughs already troubled bid for a lifetime appointment to the nations highest court.  You know, believe it or not, Im going to see whats said at the hearing, Trump told reporters.  A third woman has accused Kavanaugh of aggressive sexual behavior in the 1980s. The nominee has vehemently denied all of the allegations ahead of the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing coming up on Thursday where one of his accusers, Christine Blasey Ford, will also testify to senators.  Trump dismissed the allegations against Kavanaugh as a big fat con job orchestrated by Democrats. He did not say that Kavanaughs female accusers were lying.  I can always be convinced, Trump said. It will be interesting to hear what she has to say.  Trump himself has faced multiple accusations of sexual misconduct. He said this has shaped his view of the allegations against Kavanaugh.  Ive had a lot of false charges made against me, he said. When I see it, I view it differently than someone sitting home watching television where they say, Oh, Judge Kavanaugh this and that.  Blasey Ford will tell the committee a visibly drunk Kavanaugh and a friend locked her in a bedroom at a party in a Washington suburb in 1982, when she was 15 and he was 17, according to testimony released ahead of the hearing.  Blasey Ford says Kavanaugh climbed on top of her, tried to take off her clothes, and put his hand over her mouth when she tried to scream for help.   It was hard for me to breathe, and I thought Brett was accidentally going to kill me, her testimony says.  Kavanaugh will deny all of the allegations but will tell the committee that he was not perfect in high school.  I drank beer with my friends, usually on weekends. Sometimes I had too many. In retrospect, I said and did things in high school that make me cringe now, he said in testimony released on Wednesday.  Republican Judiciary committee staffers on Wednesday were trying to interview another woman, Julie Swetnick.  Earlier in the day, she said she attended more than 10 house parties in the Washington area from 1981 to 1983 where Kavanaugh was present. She described gang rapes she said occurred in which boys would line up to rape incapacitated girls.  In approximately 1982, I became the victim of one of these gang or train rapes where Mark Judge and Brett Kavanaugh were present, she said, mentioning the name of a close friend of Kavanaugh. She did not identify her attackers and did not accuse Kavanaugh of taking part.  During the incident, I was incapacitated without my consent and unable to fight off the boys raping me. I believe I was drugged using Quaaludes (a sedative) or something similar placed in what I was drinking, she said.  She also said she witnessed efforts by Kavanaugh and others to cause girls to become inebriated and disoriented so they could then be gang raped in a side room or a bedroom by a train of numerous boys, adding she remembers boys including Kavanaugh getting in lines to take part in these rapes.  She did not identify the individuals directly involved in those assaults.  Kavanaugh said in a statement released by the White House, This is ridiculous and from the Twilight Zone. I dont know who this is and this never happened.  Reuters was not immediately able to verify her accusations.  Swetnick is represented by lawyer Michael Avenatti, who also represents adult film star Stormy Daniels in a lawsuit against Trump to void a nondisclosure agreement under which the presidents former personal lawyer paid her $130,000 not to discuss her alleged relationship with Trump years ago.  Swetnick and Avenatti did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  An attorney for Judge said he denied Swetnicks allegation.     On Twitter, Trump called Avenatti a total low-life and a third rate lawyer who is good at making false accusations.  Avenatti responded on Twitter, calling Trump a habitual liar and complete narcissist.   In an interview with Fox News on Monday, Kavanaugh was asked whether he ever participated in or was aware of any gang rape at a party he attended. Thats totally false and outrageous. Ive never done any such thing, he responded.  Another woman, Deborah Ramirez, has accused Kavanaugh of exposing himself during a drunken dormitory party during the 1983-84 academic year when both attended Yale University. Kavanaugh has denied that allegation as well.  Republican staffers on the committee also asked Kavanaugh about two other incidents involving alcohol and sexual behavior, according to a transcript of an interview released on Wednesday. Kavanaugh told staffers they did not take place, and nobody has come forward to speak publicly about them.  Supreme Court appointments must be confirmed by the Senate. Trumps fellow Republicans control the chamber by a narrow 51-49 margin. So, Republican defections could sink the nomination.  The fight over the Supreme Court has been unfolding just weeks ahead of the Nov. 6 congressional elections in which Democrats will seek to take majority control of the Senate and the House of Representatives from the Republicans.  Trump chose Kavanaugh, a conservative appeals court judge, for the court in July, after the retirement of Justice Anthony Kennedy. If confirmed, Kavanaugh would cement conservative control of the court, as Trump moves to shift the high court and the broader federal judiciary to the right.  A committee vote on the nomination was expected on Friday, with a final Senate vote on Tuesday.  Republican Senator Chuck Grassley, the Judiciary Committees chairman, said the hearing will go forward as planned and that the panels staff is looking into Swetnicks allegations.  Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer and all the Judiciary Committees Democrats called on Kavanaugh to withdraw in light of the allegations, and said if he does not, an FBI investigation is needed before any Senate confirmation vote.   The pitched battle over Kavanaugh added to perceptions of Washington as paralyzed by partisan rancor.  Senator Jeff Flake, a moderate Republican, issued a plea for civility. We sometimes seem intent on stripping people of their humanity so that we might more easily disregard or defame them and put them through the grinder that our politics requires.  We seem, sometimes, to even enjoy that, Flake said.  Additional reporting by Susan Heavey, Lisa Lambert, Jeff Mason, David Morgan, Sarah N.

On Thursday, Kavanaugh was asked by Sen. Ted Cruz about his dissent in the Priests for Life v. the U.S. Department of Human and Health Services case. In 2015, while serving on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, Kavanaugh sided with a religious organization that objected to providing contraception for employees with insurance. Priests for Life contested the Affordable Care Act (ACA) requirement that all health plans cover birth control, claiming that IUDs and emergency contraception causes abortion instead of acting as birth control. Under the ACA, employers who wished for the government to fund the contraceptives had to fill out a form to their insurers to avoid a monetary fine. In the suit, Priests for Life said filling out the form made them complicit in providing contraception and violated the organizations religious freedom. The D.C. Circuit Court ruled in favor of the Obama administration while Kavanaugh dissented from the majority. During todays hearing, Kavanaugh explained his dissent to Cruz. The question was first, was this a substantial burden on their religious exercise? And it seemed to me, quite clearly, it was, he said. They said filling out the form would make them complicit in the abortion-inducing drugs that they were, as a religious matter, objected to. The phrase abortion-inducing drugs, in reference to contraception, was how Priests for Life described the contraception in the suit. Kavanaughs wording has many pro-choice organizations up in arms and is said to be proof of his pro-life leanings. Many opposing Kavanaughs confirmation have argued if he is approved, he will attempt to overturn Roe vs. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion nationwide. Saying abortion-inducing drugs to describe contraception is straight out of the anti-choice, anti-science phrase book used to restrict womens access to essential health care.  We wont fall for it and you shouldnt either. #StopKavanaugh pic.twitter.com/jsyrtNQ5zz  Center for Reproductive Rights (@ReproRights) September 6, 2018  The statement caused a stir among Democrats as well, California Sen. Dianne Feinstein tweeted that Kavanaugh has a gross misunderstanding of the case, which was about insurance coverage for contraceptives. Its further proof of Kavanaughs hostility toward womens reproductive freedom. Judge Kavanaugh just said Burwell v. Hobby Lobby was about ""abortion-inducing drugs.""

 Late-night hosts discussed the allegation of sexual assault being leveled against the supreme court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and how the Republican party has been handling it. Um, why are all of these arguments about whether Brett Kavanaugh is fit for the Supreme Court coming out during his confirmation hearing??? pic.twitter.com/SVPfm6ImbQ On The Daily Show, Trevor Noah made the observation that this isnt the first time the US president has backed a troubling candidate. This is like the fifth prominent person Donald Trump has supported who has been accused of mistreating women, he said. Kavanaugh has denied the allegation that he pinned a 15-year-old girl to a bed and groped her at a party when he was 17. In fact, he said he was never even 17, Noah said. He just went 15, 16, 18 just to be safe. Some of the outrage from rightwing pundits has been over the timing of the accusation. This is exactly the time that youd expect this stuff to come up, Noah countered. Thats the whole point of hearings. There has also been talk of Kavanaughs age at the time being some sort of excuse for his behaviour. Lets not add attempted rape to the list of stuff drunk boys do, he said. He continued: This is for the supreme court, not your local softball team. On The Late Show, Stephen Colbert arrived after a brief break from the small screen. News, I cant leave you alone for five minutes! he joked. While Kavanaughs accuser has spoken of her desire for the FBI to investigate the alleged crime, Trump has stated that its not something they should be involved in. The FBI doesnt have time to investigate sexual assault, that takes precious time away from real criminals like the author of the anonymous op-ed, Colbert said. Stop him before he ops again. In Kavanaughs defence, he said he had testimonies from 65 women who can defend him at that age. What teenage boy knows 65 women? he asked. Im 54 and I know, like, five. He also spoke of the Republican defence, stating: Not every man goes through a sexual assaulter phase. He continued: For everyone out there saying Boys will be boys, you should not be allowed to raise boys. Or girls. On Full Frontal, Samantha Bee also devoted time to the allegation. Well, we knew he was against a womans right to choose, we just didnt know that included her right to choose not to be under Brett Kavanaugh, she said. Bee also spoke about the rightwing reaction about the accusers timing. How is it never the right time to bring up assault allegations against a rich white dude? she asked. All this is a horrifying window into a certain kind of privileged childhood that isnt supposed to come with consequences, she continued. While some have belittled the story as being irrelevant, Bee countered: Its like if you were hiring an accountant, youd want somebody to tell you if he was also Wesley Snipes account, even if he was Wesley Snipes accountant when he was in high school. She continued: Its been 27 years since Anita Hill, can we please try and be less horrendous about it this time? On Late Night with Seth Meyers, the host played footage of Trump claiming that 10 years ago he had people telling him Brett Kavanaugh would be a good candidate for the supreme court. Ten years ago you were yelling at Gary Busey for stealing Meatloafs art supplies, he joked. Trump has also contradicted himself by saying that the accuser deserves a fair hearing but also that he entirely supports Kavanaugh. You cant say you want a fair and open process but also that youre supportive of one side, Meyers said. Hes like a ref at the Super Bowl saying: Lets have a good clean game so we can get that handsome Tom Brady another trophy. When Kavanaugh was in the White House this week, he was reportedly kept away from Trump.

    AP British officials are set to present evidence Thursday on the poisoning of an ex-Russian spy and his daughter to the United Nations Security Council. Officials on Wednesday said they charged two suspects, Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov, with using the nerve agent Novichok on Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, in Salisbury last March. Prime Minister Theresa May told British lawmakers the two suspects were Russian military intelligence agents. The Skripals were taken to the hospital in critical condition, but survived. Moscow has denied any involvement in the case.

If confirmed to the Court, I would be part of a Team of Nine, committed to deciding cases according to the Constitution and laws of the United States, he said. I would always strive to be a team player on the Team of Nine. Kavanaughs invocation of the lofty ideals of teamwork in partnership marked a stark contrast to the stunning partisanship and rancor that dominated the first day of his hearings. Even as the nominee stuck to the script that has successfully guided predecessors from both parties to the nations highest court, Democratic senators were prepared to show just how much they think the norms have been broken. Within minutes of Republican Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley beginning the session Tuesday morning, Democratis Sen. Kamala Harris of California cut in, arguing that she hadnt had enough time to review more than 40,000 documents on Kavanaugh that were released Monday night. We can not possibly move forward with this hearing, Harris said. As Grassley ruled that her motion was out of order, she fired back, If we cannot be recognized, I move to adjourn. For more than an hour, the hearing went completely off the rails as Harris and each of the other nine Democratic members of the committee talked over Grassleys attempts to begin his opening statement, criticizing the document review process and demanding to delay the hearing for more time to review Kavanaughs record. We are rushing through this process in a way that is unnecessary, said New Jersey Democrat Cory Booker. President Donald Trump highlighted the Democratic objections in tweets Friday evening, arguing that they were a display of how mean, angry, and despicable the other side is.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 4, 2018  Both sides could make a point about transparency using numbers. The committee has received more documents about Kavanaugh than any previous Supreme Court nominee, but those more than 400,000 documents make up just 10% of his record, and dont include records from his time working as staff secretary in George W. Bushs White House. Senators on both sides of the aisle bristled at each other, with little sign of collegiality or the team mentality that Kavanaugh  or Coach K  promotes when he coaches his daughters basketball team, according to a letter from team parents cited by Republican Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona. Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas said the hearing had devolved into mob rule by the Democrats. Long-serving Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont lamented the way the nomination was playing out. Im just sorry to see the Senate Judiciary Committee descend this way, he said. Overseeing the chaos, Grassley let the Democrats vent for more than an hour, but wouldnt call a vote on a motion to adjourn the hearing. If people have got something to say, this chairman is going to let them say it, he said. But its pretty boring to hear the same thing all the time. Later, as Cornyn complained that Democrats were running over their 10-minute allotment for opening statements, Grassley sighed, I let the committee run me this time. Much of the Democrats frustration may be exacerbated by the fact that they likely wont be able to prevent Kavanaugh from being confirmed. If Republicans stick together, they can push him through with a simple majority without any votes from the other side. Loudly and publicly voicing opposition is the only real recourse Democrats have to try to affect the outcome. Read More: Democrats Want to Stop Brett Kavanaugh. They May Be Out of Options Republicans on the committee charged that Democrats were following a game plan. Illinois Senator Dick Durbin, the No. 2 Democrat in the Senate, confirmed that there was a conference call over the weekend for Democrats to map out their strategy for the hearing. There are always many conference calls (and meetings, etc.) before Supreme Court confirmation hearings, a Democratic aide told TIME in an email. There has been a lot to talk about in the last several days, including over the long holiday weekend. While Kavanaugh said that a judge must be a neutral and impartial arbiter who favors no litigant or policy and that he does not decide cases based on personal or policy preferences, the controversial president who nominated him hung heavy over many of the Democrats statements and Tuesdays proceedings demonstrated what a uniquely political fight Kavanaughs nomination has become. It is ultimately an effort to re-litigate the last presidential election, said Republican Sen. Mike Crapo of Idaho. Tensions in the hearing room, already high among the senators on the dais, were amplified by near-constant interruptions by protesters from the seats reserved for spectators in the back. As the committee bickered up front, dozens of protesters were removed throughout the day for standing up and yelling during the proceedings. Kavanaugh is a danger to the future of America! one protester cried. My daughter deserves the right to choose! Moving forward with this nomination is against everything we stand for as a nation! yelled another protester wearing a shirt that said spiritual gangster on it. Multiple disruptions came from people who said they had preexisting conditions and were worried about their healthcare coverage. A group of women wearing red handmaids robes from the television show The Handmaids Tale kept a silent vigil outside the hearing room as people entered in the morning; as other demonstrators were escorted out throughout the day, those in the hearing room could still hear them chanting Hell nah, Kavanaugh! outside. In fact, irritation with disruptive protesters became one of the only issues that sparked agreement between political parties during the day. Democrat Leahy said he wouldnt keep reading his opening statement during the interruptions. I dont care whose side theyre on, he said. Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah complained about the insolence of the protesters and said, These people are so out of line they shouldnt even be allowed into the doggone room. Throughout the chaos emanating from both the front and back of the room, Kavanaugh sat quietly at his desk facing the senators, in the eye of the storm. The Supreme Court must never, never be viewed as a partisan institution, Kavanaugh said during his opening statement, which didnt begin until just before 5 pm. The Justices on the Supreme Court do not sit on opposite sides of an aisle.

On Wednesday, Kavanaugh can expect to spend most of the day in the hot seat, sparring with Democratic senators over abortion, guns, executive power and other high-profile issues. A long day of questioning awaits the 53-year-old appellate judge, whom Trump nominated in July to fill the seat of retired Justice Anthony Kennedy. The change could make the court more conservative on a range of issues. Barring a surprise, Republicans appear on track to confirm Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, perhaps in time for the first day of the new term, Oct. 1, little more than a month before congressional elections. However, the first of at least four days of hearings by the Senate Judiciary Committee began with partisan quarreling over the nomination and persistent protests from members of the audience, followed by their arrests. Strong Democratic opposition to Trumps nominee reflects the political stakes for both parties in advance of the November elections, Robert Muellers investigation of Trumps 2016 campaign and the potentially pivotal role Kavanaugh could play in moving the court to the right. Democrats, including several senators poised for 2020 presidential bids, tried to block the proceedings in a dispute over Kavanaugh records withheld by the White House. Republicans in turn accused the Democrats of turning the hearing into a circus. Trump jumped into the fray late in the day, saying on Twitter that Democrats were looking to inflict pain and embarrassment on Kavanaugh. The presidents comment followed the statements of Democratic senators who warned that Trump was, in the words of Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, selecting a justice on the Supreme Court who potentially will cast a decisive vote in his own case. In Kavanaughs own statement at the end of more than seven hours of arguing, the federal appeals judge spoke repeatedly about the importance of an independent judiciary and the need to keep the court above partisan politics, common refrains among Supreme Court nominees that had added salience in the fraught political atmosphere of the moment. With his wife, two children and parents sitting behind him, Kavanaugh called himself a judge with a straightforward judicial philosophy. A judge must be independent and must interpret the law, not make the law. A judge must interpret statutes as written. A judge must interpret the Constitution as written, informed by history and tradition and precedent, he said. The most likely outcome of this weeks hearings is a vote along party lines to send Kavanaughs nomination to the full Senate. Majority Republicans can confirm Kavanaugh without any Democratic votes, though theyll have little margin for error. There are battles worth fighting, regardless of the outcome, Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, said in an unsparing opening statement that criticized Kavanaughs judicial opinions and the Senate process that Democrats said had deprived them of access to records of important chunks of Kavanaughs time as an aide to President George W. Bush. Democrats raised objections from the moment Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, gaveled the committee to order. One by one, Democrats, including Kamala Harris of California, Cory Booker of New Jersey and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, all potential presidential contenders, demanded that Republicans delay the hearing. They railed against the unusual vetting process by Republicans that failed to include documents from three years Kavanaugh worked in the Bush administration, and 100,000 more pages withheld by the Trump White House. Some 42,000 pages were released to senators only, not the public, on the evening before the hearing. As protesters repeatedly interrupted the session, Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, who is fighting for his own re-election in Texas, apologized to Kavanaugh for the spectacle he said had less to do about the judges legal record than Trump in the White House. It is about politics, said Cruz. It is about Democratic senators re-litigating the 2016 election. Republicans will hold a slim 51-49 majority in the Senate once Jon Kyl, the former Arizona senator, is sworn in to fill the seat held by the late Sen. John McCain. Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska are the only two Republicans even remotely open to voting against Kavanaugh, though neither has said she would do so. Abortion rights supporters are trying to appeal to those senators, who both favor abortion access.",What to Expect From Day Two of Brett Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court Confirmation Hearings,http://time.com/5387133/brett-kavanaugh-confirmation-hearings-day-2/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/ap18247804021366.jpg?quality=85,14

But perhaps DeVoss most alarming error to date has received insufficient public attention. This disregard is regrettable because her blunder illuminates one of the U.S. Supreme Courts most momentous opinions  and exposes a mounting threat to the decision. As last school year drew to a close, Congressman Adrian Espaillat of New York asked DeVos in a committee hearing whether public educators could report undocumented students to Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Sir, I think thats a school decision, DeVos replied. Thats a community decision. That response, however, revealed a deluded conception of unauthorized immigrants constitutional rights. In 1982, the Supreme Court, in a 5-4 decision called Plyler v. Doe, rejected a Texas law that authorized local schools to exclude undocumented students. Writing for the Court, Justice William Brennan found that the law impermissibly punished innocent children for parental misconduct, and that it clashed with the countrys deepest constitutional commitments. If left unchecked, Brennan reasoned, the measure raise[d] the specter of a permanent caste of undocumented resident aliens, a development present[ing] most difficult problems for a Nation that prides itself on adherence to principles of equality under law. In essence, a students immigration status forms an illegitimate basis for barring children from school. When the Court issued Plyler, no state in the country other than Texas had enacted such legislation. This legislative backdrop has motivated prominent constitutional scholars to dismiss Plyler as an insignificant opinion that invalidated merely an outlier statute. The Courts decision is thus construed as merely eliminating a blatantly outlandish measure  one that would hold no appeal beyond the Lone Star State, where a cowboy mentality prevails. But such dismissive assessments miss the mark. Rather than some trivial event in the nations constitutional history, it seems far more accurate to understand Plyler as preventing an isolated measure from becoming pervasive, as anxieties about unauthorized immigrants extend well beyond states along the southern border. Few opinions in American history have had more profound consequences than Plylers guarantee that the schoolhouse doors cannot be closed to one of societys most marginalized, vilified groups. The opinion has single-handedly enabled innumerable children to use education to expand both their minds and their horizons. About two weeks after her blunder, DeVos retreated from claiming that public schools could police students immigration status, labeling Plyler a settled case and conceding that undocumented students have the right to an education. The pressing question now, however, is: how much longer will that right exist? Several factors suggest that Plyler could soon be endangered. Trumps successful presidential campaign, which cast unauthorized immigrants as boogeymen, revealed unmistakably that nativist sentiment exerts a powerful force throughout the country. That reality indicates it is only a matter of time before localities, states and perhaps even the federal government enact measures challenging Plyler. (One could imagine supporters echoing the Trump Administrations logic for its family-separation policy: that it would deter parents from bringing their children to the United States illegally.) Although Alabama and California both enacted legislation designed to undermine Plyler several years ago, those efforts were successfully interred in lower federal courts. But this time could be different. Indeed, ample reason suggests the Supreme Court could greet new anti-Plyler legislation favorably. In 1982, a young lawyer working in the Reagan Administration named John G. Roberts, Jr. coauthored a memorandum bemoaning the Department of Justices failure to file an amicus brief in Plyler actively supporting Texas. Had it done so, Roberts speculated, the Court would have upheld the law. Now the Chief Justice, if Roberts continues to believe that Plyler erred, then he could well rally his fellow conservative colleagues to overturn the decision. Robertss burden on this front appears on the verge of growing easier, as Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaughs confirmation hearings commence. If  as seems probable  Kavanaugh secures confirmation, he would fill the seat of his old boss, Justice Anthony Kennedy. Kennedys jurisprudence often exhibited solicitude for the plight of vulnerable children  the reasoning in Plyler. Yet while it was exceedingly difficult to envision Kennedy abandoning undocumented children, it seems eminently plausible that Kavanaugh would do so. The reason is simple: Kavanaugh, unlike Kennedy, has been a steadfast, even exuberant participant in the Republican partys movement for constitutional conservatism, and the G.O.P. has now coalesced around an anti-immigrant ethos. Where Kennedy often bucked Federalist Society orthodoxy, only a naf would doubt Kavanaughs devotion. If Democratic Senators press Kavanaugh on Plyler in hearings, he will likely, borrowing from Secretary DeVos, deem the opinion settled. But that is no guarantee that he will uphold the precedent, a prospect that undocumented families  and, indeed, all families  should find unsettling.

Kavanaughs nomination to the Supreme Court, showing no signs of hesitation after he categorically denied a decades-old sexual misconduct allegation that has roiled the final days of an already rancorous confirmation fight. The statement from Kavanaugh on Friday was his first response to news reports about a possible episode of sexual misconduct that surfaced this week. A letter received by Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, details an accusation from a woman who said she was at a party with Kavanaugh when they were both in high school, according to a person familiar with the matter. The letter says that the alleged misconduct occurred after Kavanaugh and the woman went into a room along with a friend of Kavanaughs, according to the person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive matter. She escaped from the room, according to the allegation. The letter, which is brief, is dated in July, according to another person familiar with it. I categorically and unequivocally deny this allegation, Kavanaugh, 53, said in a statement distributed by the White House. I did not do this back in high school or at any time. The sudden disclosure of the allegation against President Trumps Supreme Court pick has only raised more questions, particularly about how the information had been handled as Kavanaughs confirmation progressed steadily through the Senate. His fate now hinges on the decisions of a handful of undecided senators, particularly two Republican women  Susan Collins (Maine) and Lisa Murkowski (Alaska)  who support abortion rights and now have to weigh the allegation in an era in which awareness of sexual harassment and misconduct have come to the forefront. White House officials spent the day making calls to senators and aides to determine what impact the letter will have on Kavanaughs nomination and whether it might blow it up, according to a senior administration official. As of now, White House officials do not conclude it will. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has not commented on the allegation, and Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), who chairs the Judiciary Committee and only learned of the letter through news reports, has been briefed on its contents. But Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (Utah), the most senior Senate Republican who has read the letter, saidevery accuser deserves to be heard, but a process of verification is also necessary.The GOP-controlled Judiciary Committee reiterated Fridaythat it would hold a panel vote Sept.20. Republicans are intent on confirming Kavanaugh in the final week of September, which would put him on track to be installed at the court by the start of its fall session on Oct. 1. Earlier Friday, Kavanaugh held what could be a pivotal phone call with Collins, who is publicly undecided. The phone call lasted about an hour, according to a spokeswoman, who offered no details about the conversation  including whether Collins asked about the allegation. The developments snowballed this week after Feinstein released a cryptic and vague statement Thursday saying she had referredinformation about Kavanaugh to federal authorities. She did not detail the material she had, citing confidentiality concerns. That information came via a letter that was sent to Rep. Anna G. Eshoo (D-Calif.), and subsequently passed on to Feinstein, people familiar with the matter said. Other Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee first learned about the contents of the letter at a last-minute meeting Wednesday evening. Other Democrats hadprivately pressed Feinstein about it as rumors about its existence began to circulate in recent days. A spokesman for Feinstein said Friday that the senator received the information through a third party. The senator took these allegations seriously and believed they should be public, spokesman Tom Mentzer said. However, the woman in question made it clear she did not want this information to be public. It is critical in matters of sexual misconduct to protect the identity of the victim when they wish to remain anonymous, and the senator did so in this case. The version of the letter that the FBI received has redacted the name of the woman, according to a Republican official with knowledge of the letter. The FBI does not plan to launch a criminal investigation into the matter and instead sent the material to the White House to be added to Kavanaughs background-check file. Within an hour of receiving it, the White House sent that updated material back to the Senate Judiciary Committee, where the information is limited to senators and a tight circle of senior aides. Meanwhile, Kavanaughs allies moved aggressively to defend the nominee and push back against the allegation. A group of women who said they knew Kavanaugh in high school made contact late Thursday afternoon with several of the nominees former clerks who are helping in Kavanaughs confirmation process. The women had seen news reports about the allegation against Kavanaugh, and the husband of one of the women had been contacted by a reporter who was looking into the accusation. The women offered their help, and eventually the group decided to draft a letter defending Kavanaughs character, according to a person involved in the process. The list of signatories grew quickly as the women contacted their own friends, who in turn contacted others who knew Kavanaugh in high school, the person said. By Friday morning, the letter had 65 signatories and was sent to Grassleys staff, which then swiftly blasted it out to reporters. Through the more than 35 years we have known him, Brett has stood out for his friendship, character, and integrity, the women wrote to the Senate Judiciary Committee. In particular, he has always treated women with decency and respect. That was true when he was in high school, and it has remained true to this day. The women said they knew Kavanaugh when he attended high school from 1979 to 1983 at Georgetown Preparatory School, an all-boys academy in Montgomery County, Md. Kavanaughs confirmation  which could cement a conservative majority on the Supreme Court for a generation  depends on five or so senators who have yet to announce how they will vote, even as the political battle over the nomination escalates. Aside from Collins, Murkowski also remains publicly undecided. Three Democratic senators who helped confirm now-Justice Neil M. Gorsuch last year  Heidi Heitkamp (N.D.), Joe Donnelly (Ind.) and Joe Manchin III (W.Va.)  are up for reelection this fall in Republican states and are under intense pressure to side with a Trump Supreme Court pick again. Another moderate, Sen. Doug Jones (D-Ala.), also has not announced his position on Kavanaugh. In recent days, Jones contacted the Judiciary Committee to ask to look at various Kavanaugh documents as he continues to deliberate, according to a congressional official. Jones was elected in December in a deeply Republican state and did not vote on Gorsuchs confirmation. Gorsuch was confirmed in April 2017. Although Grassley has not commented on the allegation, other Senate Republicans have leveled a furious defense of Kavanaugh, his qualifications and his character. I do not intend to allow Judge Kavanaughs confirmation to be stalled because of an 11th-hour accusation that Democrats did not see fit to raise for over a month, said Hatch, a former chairman of the committee. The senator in the best position to determine the credibility of these accusations made the conscious decision not to take action on them, and the authorities to whom the accusations have been referred have decided not to take action, either. Judiciary Committee staffers noted that Kavanaugh has undergone six FBI background investigations in a public-service career that began in 1993. No such sexual misconduct allegation had surfaced in those probes, Republicans said, and Grassleys staffers said no such claim had been reported to them or to the 10 other GOP senators on the Judiciary Committee. Meanwhile, Feinstein did not attend the closed session of Kavanaughs confirmation hearing last Thursday, a venue in which sensitive information can be discussed. The sexual misconduct allegation did not come up during the closed session, Republicans said. Mentzer, Feinsteins spokesman, confirmed that she missed the late-night session and said she had not been feeling well. Feinstein, who is up for reelection this fall, came under intense criticism for her handling of the matter by opponent Kevin de Len, a California state senator who has been running to Feinsteins left. What we have here is a failure of leadership, de Len said Friday. He wondered why Feinstein waited until this week to give the information about Kavanaugh to the FBI, andwhySenator Feinstein politely pantomimed her way through last weeks hearing without a single question about the content of Kavanaughs character. At that hearing last week, under questioning by Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), who asks a specific question of all nominees who come before the committee, Kavanaugh testified that he has never committedany verbal or physical harassment or assault of a sexual nature since he became an adult. Anita Hill, the Brandeis University professor who testified in 1991 that now-Justice Clarence Thomas sexually harassed her when she was in her mid-20s  a claim he denied  said Friday that the allegation against Kavanaugh shows the governmentneeds to find a fair and neutral way for complaints to be investigated. The Senate Judiciary Committee should put in place a process that enables anyone with a complaint of this nature to be heard, Hill said in a statement. I have seen firsthand what happens when such a process is weaponized against an accuser, and no one should have to endure that again.  Josh Dawsey contributed to this report.

Bush.,center,text,2018-09-11T21:35:25Z,reuters,Reuters,"3 Min Read WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Democratic senator on Tuesday raised new questions about whether U.S. Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh has accurately described his role in a controversial judicial nomination when he worked for then-President George W. Bush.  Emails previously withheld as committee confidential but released by the office of Democratic Senator Dick Durbin, suggest that Kavanaugh, a White House lawyer at the time, cast light on his involvement in the nomination of William Haynes, a controversial Department of Defense lawyer, for an appeals court position.  White House spokesman Raj Shah said the emails are consistent with Kavanaughs testimony and called Durbins actions a pathetic attempt to smear the nominee.  President Donald Trumps nomination of Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court is now in the hands of the U.S. Senate. Republicans control the 51 Senate votes needed to confirm Kavanaugh if they stick together.  Democrats are trying hard to raise questions about the nominee because they see Kavanaugh tilting the court even further to the right. A final Senate vote is expected by the end of September.  Kavanaugh told Durbin in 2006, when Bush nominated him to his current position as an appeals court judge in Washington, that the Haynes nomination was not one he handled.  One 2002 email released by Durbin showed Kavanaugh weighing in on a suggestion that Haynes be nominated for a vacancy on the Richmond-based 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, questioning if he was conservative enough.  But what is the basis for saying he would be an across-the- board judicial conservative? Kavanaugh asked.  An email from 2003 from then-White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales invited Kavanaugh to play golf with Haynes.  In releasing the emails, Durbin revived his own long-simmering dispute dating to Kavanaughs 2006 confirmation hearing. Durbin had asked then about whether Kavanaugh was involved in the Haynes nomination.  The White House pointed to a question from another senator at the same 2006 hearing, in which Kavanaugh said yes when asked if he would have been involved in discussions on the Haynes nomination if it came up. Kavanaugh said he could not recall such conversations.  In a statement, Durbin sought to tie Kavanaughs Haynes testimony to several other issues on which Democrats say Kavanaugh gave misleading answers during his confirmation hearing last week, including whether he was involved in the Bush administrations interrogation policies.  This is a theme that we see emerge with Judge Kavanaugh time and time again. He says one thing under oath, and then the documents tell a different story, Durbin said  As general counsel at the Pentagon, Haynes was involved in detainee and interrogation policy decisions after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks. He was not ultimately confirmed.  Reporting by Richard Cowan and Lawrence Hurley; Editing by Kevin Drawbaugh and Cynthia Osterman All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

Judge Brett Kavanaugh, 53, has served for the past 12 years on the appeals court in Washington, D.C., which is considered the second most important court in the country after the Supreme Court. He has a solidly conservative record, including a dissenting opinion last year that would have denied immediate access to an abortion for an immigrant teenager in federal custody. 






Kavanaugh worked in key White House positions when George W. Bush was president and was a member of independent counsel Kenneth Starrs legal team that investigated President Bill Clinton in the late 1990s, leading to Clintons impeachment.


As a young lawyer, Kavanaugh worked for Justice Anthony Kennedy, the man he would replace on the high court. Kennedy retired at the end of July. Trumps first nominee, Justice Neil Gorsuch, also was a Kennedy law clerk the same year as Kavanaugh.
The first day of the Senate Judiciary Committee hearings Tuesday will feature opening statements from senators and Kavanaugh himself. His remarks are not likely to be released in advance, but nominees often sing the praises of judicial independence. When he was sworn in as an appellate judge in 2006, Kavanaugh called an independent judiciary the crown jewel of our constitutional democracy.
Questioning will begin on Wednesday, and votes in committee and on the Senate floor could occur later in September. If all goes as Republicans plan, Kavanaugh could be on the bench when the court begins its new term on Oct. 1.

Sen. Chuck Grassley, the Iowa Republican who is the committee chairman, has called Kavanaugh one of the most qualified nominees ever picked for the court. The American Bar Association has given Kavanaugh its highest rating, well qualified.
Rebuffed in their request to delay the hearing, Democrats are planning to shine a light on Kavanaughs views on abortion, executive power and whether Trump could be forced to testify as part of special counsel Robert Muellers Russia investigation.
I remain troubled by your view of executive power, Democratic Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware, a committee member, wrote Friday in an open letter to Kavanaugh. I am not satisfied with your responses to me during our private meeting, and I believe that you owe the Committee and the American people more thorough, candid answers during your hearing next week.


Many Democratic senators already have announced their intention to vote against Kavanaugh and many Republicans have likewise signaled their support. A handful of Democrats seeking re-election in states Trump carried in 2016 could vote for Kavanaugh.
If no Democrat ultimately supports the nomination, the Republicans have no margin for error in a Senate they control by 50-49. Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska are the only two Republicans even remotely open to voting against Kavanaugh, though neither has said she would do so. Abortion rights supporters are trying to appeal to those senators by focusing on concerns that Kavanaugh could vote to limit abortion rights or even overturn the landmark Roe v. Wade ruling from 1973 that first established a womans constitutional right to an abortion.


Democrats have been under intense pressure from liberal voters to resist Trump, and many remain irate, even two years later, over the treatment of Merrick Garland, President Barack Obamas nominee for the Supreme Court, who was denied so much as a hearing last year by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.
But Democrats are powerless to delay a vote on Kavanaugh since McConnell led Republicans, during the Gorsuch nomination, in eliminating the 60-vote filibuster threshold that had been in place for Supreme Court nominations.
The filibuster rule required 60 of the 100 votes to advance a bill or nomination, in contrast to the simple 51-vote majority that applies in most cases.

But the allegations of sexual misconduct which have emerged during Senate confirmation hearings have cast a shadow. He denies the allegations.  A Yale law school graduate, he was born in Washington DC, and has served since 2006 on the influential US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, ruling on some of the nation's most high-profile cases. He worked previously as White House lawyer and adviser under George W Bush. In the 1990s, he worked for Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel who investigated then President Bill Clinton, helping draft the report urging the Democrat's impeachment.  He was also a clerk to the man he is due to replace on the Supreme Court, Justice Anthony Kennedy, 81, who is to retire later this year. As an ideological conservative, he would be expected to push the court to the right on a number of issues including business regulation and national security. Judges are appointed for their lifetime, and as Mr Kavanaugh is relatively young at the age of 53, he could serve for decades to come. The US Supreme Court is the ultimate arbiter on contentious laws and disputes between states and the federal government, and rules on such issues as abortion, the death penalty, voter rights and immigration policy. Mr Kavanaugh is Mr Trump's second Supreme Court appointment, out of nine judges. The court already has a 5-4 conservative majority, but his appointment could shift the bench further to the right than under Mr Kennedy, who occasionally sided with the four liberal justices in the court. The president said of him on the day of his nomination: ""Judge Kavanaugh has impeccable credentials, unsurpassed qualifications and a proven commitment to equal justice under the law. ""There is no-one in America more qualified for this position and no-one more deserving."" The nominee himself described his judicial philosophy as ""straightforward"". ""A judge must be independent and must interpret the law, not make the law,"" he said. ""A judge must interpret statutes as written. And a judge must interpret the Constitution as written, informed by history and tradition and precedent."" Some of his previous rulings give an idea of his opinion on a range of important matters. Abortion Mr Kavanaugh has not expressed outright opposition to Roe v Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court ruling that legalised abortion nationwide, but he has given some indications of where he might stand. Last year, the DC Circuit Court ruled that an undocumented immigrant teenager in detention was entitled to seek an abortion.  Mr Kavanaugh objected, saying that her right to have an abortion was ""based on a constitutional principle as novel as it is wrong: a new right for unlawful immigrant minors in US government detention to obtain immediate abortion on demand"". He argued the teenager needed an adult sponsor (as her parents were not available) with whom to discuss her decision. He did, however, write in his dissent to the ruling that the court must recognise Roe v Wade and another abortion rights case ""as precedents we must follow"". Executive power Mr Kavanaugh argued in a 2009 article that presidents should be shielded from criminal investigations and civil lawsuits while in office. That could be a red flag to Democrats - indicating that if the special counsel investigation into Mr Trump's alleged campaign ties to Russia finds its way to the Supreme Court, he would not support action against Mr Trump before his term is up. Guns He is pro-second amendment - the constitutional right to bear arms.  In 2011, he objected when the DC Circuit Court upheld a ban on most semi-automatic rifles in the district. He argued that, because most handguns are semi-automatic, and are protected by a previous Supreme Court ruling, semi-automatic rifles should benefit from the same protection. The environment Mr Kavanaugh has issued rulings and dissents against Obama-era environmental regulations, including efforts to curb air pollution from power plants and greenhouse gases.  Brett Kavanaugh's nomination will go to a full US Senate vote but talks continue over an FBI inquiry. Is cutting out food groups a good idea?

But justices rarely perform the way partisans and the news media expect them to.,center,text,2018-09-06T10:00:05Z,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,"Advertisement Supported by Justices often do not perform the way partisans and the news media expect them to. By Peter H. Schuck Mr. Schuck is an emeritus professor of law at Yale. Commentary on Supreme Court nominations these days is more akin to sportscasters announcing a close baseball game: The liberals and conservatives are tied going into the bottom of the ninth. Brett Kavanaugh, a promising rookie pitcher with a strong minor league record, is coming in to replace the streaky Anthony Kennedy. When Kennedy was hot, the conservatives won, but when he slumped, the liberals could squeeze by. Kavanaugh seems a lot steadier than Kennedy. This way of handicapping Supreme Court nominees has a definite allure. We all love a horse race, and politics often seems like one. But for court nominations, sports analogies are dangerously misleading. It is true that knowing the party of the president and the nominee provides a strong indication of how the nominee will later vote in cases of sharp partisan differences on the underlying policy issue  for example, the recent Janus v. Afscme decision barring a union from imposing agency fees on nonmembers.  But in 75 percent of cases, partisan affiliation is not fully predictive of justices votes. In the hardest ones, lower courts reached different results despite seeing the same evidence, and considering the same legal arguments. This week, senators should spend less time grandstanding with questions that simply highlight Judge Kavanaughs well-known ideological positions, and a lot more time trying to assess how he would vote in these much trickier cases. What accounts for these circuit splits? In hard cases, excellent legal arguments (not just ideological ones) can be made on both sides, often because the relevant legal principles are unclear or conflicting. Also, judges (and administrative agencies initially) can reasonably interpret the key facts differently. The competing values (there may be more than two) may be compelling. Most justices care about a decisions legal and social consequences, yet in hard cases these effects may be opaque and unpredictable  perhaps because they depend on what the states decide to do.  In some hard cases  Brown v. Board of Education or same-sex marriage, for example  the legal and social landscape may have shifted so much that even conservative justices, who normally resist living Constitution arguments, may take these changes into account. In clashes between national security and individual rights claims (e.g., the recent travel ban decision), even liberal justices may defer to the governments judgment. And it is hard to predict how courts will apply the multiple criteria  what Judge Kavanaugh referred to in his testimony this week as precedents on precedents  for deciding when precedents may be overturned. This is why even some conservative justices may resist overturning Roe v. Wade. (They may try to eviscerate it in other ways, of course.)  And, of course, even on the Supreme Court, politics has a way of trumping ideology in unpredictable ways. Who would have expected that Chief Justice John Roberts would seek out a way to rescue the Affordable Care Act in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius? Media and politicians have traditionally tended to ignore these complexities, preferring to depict a Manichaean liberal/conservative battle for legal supremacy. This perverse ideological focus hides or denies the fascinating interplay among legal doctrine, textual interpretation and the factual record in determining outcomes. It also crowds out the more revealing lawyerly divisions among the justices about what should matter in resolving hard cases  for example, the relative importance of national uniformity versus local diversity, of clear rules versus more contextual standards, of government authority versus individual rights, of deference to elected officials versus bureaucratic expertise, of the default rules for interpreting ambiguous language, and so forth.  Ideological labels are even misleading in their own terms. Real judges (like real people) mix liberalism on some issues with conservatism on others. For example, even the arch-conservative Antonin Scalia voted with liberals to uphold punitive jury awards against product manufacturers, adopting the position advocated by the trial lawyers (a leading Democratic lobby), because he thought the Constitution permits such awards.  The labels also reveal little about what should be our real concerns: the mix of values underlying them. For example, is a law-and-order conservative callous toward the life challenges faced by poor people, or instead sensitive to the depredations that crime inflicts on their communities? Is race-based affirmative action a policy that levels the playing field for all or instead one that advantages some minorities over others?  None of this means that partisan decision patterns dont exist. But it does argue for a more nuanced view of a nominee, one that includes factors beyond partisanship. President Trump has selected the kind of reliably conservative jurist that one would expect any Republican president to nominate. Judge Kavanaughs right-wing supporters and left-wing opponents are equally keen to portray him as a guaranteed vote to overrule Roe and other liberal shibboleths, but hard cases often cause justices to confound ideological expectations. John Paul Stevens, David Souter and Anthony Kennedy, all justices nominated by Republican presidents, took the liberal side in important cases. (Such unexpected shifts have probably become less likely with more intensive ideological screening by outside groups.) Once confirmed, Judge Kavanaugh will enjoy total independence from any president. Had a normal president nominated him rather than a bizarre, lawless one, this nomination would be no more controversial than, say, Elena Kagans  another superbly qualified choice. Unless the Democrats come up with something disqualifying, he should be confirmed.  Peter H.

By Paul Krugman Opinion Columnist At a fundamental level, the attempt to jam Brett Kavanaugh onto the Supreme Court closely resembles the way Republicans passed a tax cut last year. Once again we see a rushed, nakedly partisan process, with G.O.P. leaders withholding much of the information thats supposed to go into congressional deliberations. Once again the outcome is all too likely to rest on pure tribalism: Unless some Republicans develop a very late case of conscience, they will vote along party lines with the full knowledge that theyre abdicating their constitutional duty to provide advice and consent. True, Kavanaugh is at least getting a hearing, which the tax bill never did. But hes bobbing and weaving his way through, refusing to answer even straightforward questions, displaying an evasiveness utterly at odds with the probity we used to expect of Supreme Court justices. No, the real difference from the tax bill story is that last year we were talking only about a couple of trillion dollars. This year were talking about the future of the Republic. For a Kavanaugh confirmation will set us up for multiple constitutional crises. After all, if Kavanaugh is confirmed, we will be trying to navigate a turbulent era in American politics with a Supreme Court in which two seats were effectively stolen. First Republicans refused even to give President Barack Obamas nominee so much as a hearing; then they will have filled two positions with nominees chosen by a president who lost the popular vote and eked out an Electoral College win only with aid from a hostile foreign power.  [Receive the days most urgent debates right in your inbox by subscribing to the Opinion Today newsletter.]  Would a Justice Kavanaugh conduct himself with the caution appropriate to such a fraught situation? Well, miracles of personal redemption do happen. But its very unlikely. On the contrary, every indication is that if he makes it, he and his fellow justices will abuse their power at every level. After all, what do we know about Kavanaugh? Theres a lot we dont know, thanks to the unprecedented way Republicans and the Trump administration are stonewalling on thousands of pages of his records. And whats in those hidden records must be really damning, given what we already know  a record that would, in normal times, be more than enough to rule him out as a potential member of the nations highest court. Remember, Kavanaugh cut his teeth working for the Starr investigation into Bill Clinton  a genuine witch hunt that consumed seven years and tens of millions of dollars without finding any evidence of wrongdoing. And he personally spent years obsessively pursuing crazy conspiracy theories about the suicide of Vince Foster. Then he spent time working in the George W. Bush White House, which made torture a routine part of policy. In his 2006 confirmation hearing for an appellate court judgeship he declared that he played no role in those decisions. Was he telling the truth? The answer might lie in those thousands of pages of records the Trump administration is refusing to release.  Strange to say, however, he emerged from that experience as someone who believes that presidents cant be subject to legal investigations. Meanwhile, Kavanaugh accumulated a record as an appellate judge  one that places him far to the right on everything from the environment, to labor rights, to discrimination. His anti-labor views are especially extreme, even for a conservative. So who is Brett Kavanaugh? If he looks like a right-wing apparatchik and quacks like a right-wing apparatchik, hes almost surely a right-wing apparatchik. Which brings us to the coming constitutional crises. The immediate question is how the court will handle Donald Trumps obstruction of justice, which is likely to reach epic levels very soon. If you think Kavanaugh wouldnt completely support Trump, I have some miracle dietary supplements you might want to buy. Beyond that, what will happen if we eventually get a Democratic Congress and president, who try to move forward with a center-left agenda? What I mean by that, by the way, are things like expanding health coverage and raising taxes on high incomes  things that arent radical, and in fact have broad popular support. Theres every reason to believe that a court including Kavanaugh would strike down everything elected officials tried to do. Policy substance aside, this would destroy the courts legitimacy, making its naked partisanship  based, again, on two stolen seats  clear to all. But it would probably happen anyway. In fact, the constitutional carnage might well begin as soon as next year. We know that if Republicans hold on in the midterms theyll quickly move to destroy Obamacare and take insurance away from millions. But even if they lose, what are the odds that if Kavanaugh is confirmed, the court will find some excuse to declare the Affordable Care Act unconstitutional? Surely theyre pretty high. So let me make a last-minute appeal to Republican senators who care about Americas future, if there are any left: Dont do this. A vote for Kavanaugh will be a vote to destroy the legitimacy of one of the last federal institutions standing.

By The Editorial Board The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section. In a more virtuous world, Judge Brett Kavanaugh would be deeply embarrassed by the manner in which he has arrived at the doorstep of a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court. He was nominated by a president who undermines daily the nations democratic order and mocks the constitutional values that Judge Kavanaugh purports to hold dear.  Now hes being rammed through his confirmation process with an unprecedented degree of secrecy and partisan maneuvering by Republican senators who, despite their overflowing praise for his legal acumen and sterling credentials, appear terrified for the American people to find out much of anything about him beyond his penchant for coaching girls basketball.  Perhaps most concerning, Judge Kavanaugh seems to have trouble remembering certain important facts about his years of service to Republican administrations. More than once this week, he testified in a way that appeared to directly contradict evidence in the record.  For example, he testified that Roe v. Wade is settled as a precedent of the Supreme Court. But he said essentially the opposite in a 2003 email leaked to The Times. I am not sure that all legal scholars refer to Roe as the settled law of the land at the Supreme Court level since Court can always overrule its precedent, and three current Justices on the Court would do so, he wrote then. Judge Kavanaughs backers in the Senate brushed this off by pointing out that his 2003 statement was factually correct. Theyre right, which means that his testimony this week was both disingenuous and meaningless. As weve learned with each new trickle of previously withheld documents, Judge Kavanaugh didnt start misleading senators just this week.  At his 2004 confirmation hearing before the Judiciary Committee, he denied any involvement in the vetting of a controversial judicial nominee while serving as one of President George W. Bushs White House lawyers. The nominee, William Pryor Jr., had among other things called Roe v. Wade the worst abomination of constitutional law in our history. In fact, Mr. Kavanaugh was more than a little involved, as emails from that period  which Senate Republicans had withheld until early Thursday morning  made clear. In that 2004 hearing and again in 2006, when he was being considered for a seat on the federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., Mr. Kavanaugh told Congress, under oath, that he knew nothing about the extensive theft of secret strategy documents from Democratic senators computers by Republican staffers. As it turns out, he did in fact receive those documents or summaries of them. But he now claims that he had no reason to believe that they had been stolen, even though one email he got had the subject line spying and began, I have a friend who is a mole for us on the left.  Then there are the persistent doubts about his truthfulness in telling senators in 2006 that he had no knowledge of Mr. Bushs warrantless wiretapping program or his detainee treatment policy  claims that have been called into question by yet more emails, which showed he knew about both of those things years before they became public.  As Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois told Judge Kavanaugh on Thursday, You say that words matter. You claim to be a textualist when you interpret other peoples words, but you dont want to be held accountable for the plain meaning of your own words. Judge Kavanaugh was quick to provide lawyerly explanations for all of these discrepancies, but they paint a pattern thats hard to ignore: He misstates facts under oath, and Republicans cover for him by making it hard, if not impossible, to get the documents proving it. With the help of the White House and a personal lawyer for Mr. Bush, Senator Chuck Grassley, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, has subverted a long-established, nonpartisan process and hidden more than 90 percent of the material pertaining to Judge Kavanaughs time in government.  Its only thanks to Senate Democrats and others that weve been able to see important pieces of the judges lengthy paper trail. There is far more that was never even requested. Far from being embarrassed by all this, Judge Kavanaugh is acting like someone who knows there is virtually nothing he can do to imperil his nomination. Instead, hes followed his own cynical advice to a 2002 judicial nominee: She should not talk about her views on specific policy or legal issues, he wrote in an email then. She should say that she has a commitment to follow Supreme Court precedent, that she understands and appreciates the role of a circuit judge, that she will adhere to statutory text, that she has no ideological agenda. That is more or less how Judge Kavanaugh got through his hearings. But his ideological agenda is well known, which is precisely why hes been on Republican Supreme Court shortlists for the last decade. That agenda includes, for starters, a well-established hostility to womens reproductive rights and a stunningly expansive view of presidential power and impunity. Republicans defend their steamrollering by saying that most Democrats have already made up their minds to oppose Judge Kavanaugh. Thats rich: In the months before the 2016 election, multiple high-ranking Republican senators openly vowed to block any and all Supreme Court picks by Hillary Clinton, period. Its also irrelevant. The people deserve to know everything possible about nominees to a lifetime seat on the highest court in the land, and they depend on their senators to seek out that information and share it.  The Constitution calls this process advice and consent. Until the last few years, Republicans claimed to take that responsibility seriously. Now they are making a mockery of what is meant to be a careful and deliberative process by playing three-card monte with the American people. They did the same with last years tax bill, rushing it through in the dead of night with virtually no debate or review.  The Republicans engage in this sort of subterfuge for an obvious reason: While they hold unified power in Washington, most of their agenda is hugely unpopular. So they hide as much of it as possible out of a fear that if more of it came to light, they will pay at the polls. Come November, voters can make that fear come true.

 Senators on the Judiciary Committee pressed Judge Brett Kavanaugh about the constitutional right to abortion and his views on the special counsel.  The third day of confirmation hearings for the Supreme Court nominee Brett M. Kavanaugh, and the second day of senators questioning, began at 9:30 a.m. and stretched late into the night.  The release of documents once marked committee confidential fortified Democratic questions on abortion, affirmative action and whether Judge Kavanaugh knew of Republican aides theft of Democratic computer files.  Many of those confidential documents spilled out in an anonymous release to The New York Times. Judge Kavanaughs abortion views created a stir outside the hearing room. Adding to the concerns of abortion rights advocates was a Kavanaugh reference to contraceptives as abortion-inducing drugs. He was answering a question from Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, about his dissent in a case involving Priests for Life, a religious organization that objected to a regulation under the Affordable Care Act requiring many employers to provide free insurance coverage for contraception to their female workers. Advertisement The group had objected to an accommodation offered by the Obama administration that allowed it to obtain a waiver by completing a form. Advertisement They said filling out the form would make them complicit in the provision of the abortion inducing drugs that they were as a religious matter objecting to, Judge Kavanaugh testified. Some religious organizations regard any form of birth control as an abortifacient. But Judge Kavanaughs use of the term abortion-inducing drugs set off alarm bells among abortion rights advocates and spawned a hashtag, #abortioninducingdrugs, on Twitter. Erica Sackin, director of political communications for Planned Parenthood of America, commented on Twitter: 
            BIG FLAG: #Kavanaugh just called birth control ""abortion-inducing drugs""         Judge Kavanaugh would not say whether he thought the Supreme Courts 2015 decision establishing a constitutional right to same-sex marriage had been correctly decided. But he tried to convey sympathy for gay rights by quoting from a Supreme Court decision in June that sided with a Colorado baker who refused to create a wedding cake for a same-sex couple. The ruling did not address the central dispute in the case and turned instead on apparent hostility against religion in a state civil rights commission. Judge Kavanaugh focused on one statement in the majority opinion, written by Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, the member of the court he hopes to replace. Our society has come to the recognition that gay persons and gay couples cannot be treated as social outcasts or as inferior in dignity and worth, Justice Kennedy wrote. Judge Kavanaugh noted that Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justices Samuel A. Alito Jr. and Neil M. Gorsuch, all members of the courts conservative wing, had joined the opinion. And he suggested that he agreed with the sentiment, too. Amid the arcane discussions of Supreme Court precedent and judicial philosophy, the Kavanaugh hearings did have some lighter moments. Advertisement Senator John Kennedy, Republican of Louisiana, had some probing questions about Judge Kavanaughs past: Did you ever get in trouble? Were you more of a John Boy Walton type or a Ferris Bueller type? The judge didnt bite. Mr. Cruz asked Judge Kavanaugh if he intends to play basketball at the court inside the Supreme Court building. No sitting justice has played there, Mr. Cruz said, since Justice Clarence Thomas, many years ago, when he was a much younger justice. Judge Kavanaugh said that if confirmed, he does indeed intend to play, on what is known as the highest court in the land. And speaking of basketball, Judge Kavanaugh is exceedingly proud of the girls basketball teams he has coached through the Catholic Youth Organization at his home parish, Blessed Sacrament in Chevy Chase, Md. About a dozen current and former players  in blue sweaters, ponytails and plaid skirts  showed up to watch. They sat in the front rows, right behind their coach. Judge Kavanaugh introduced each of them, rattling off their names and, in a remarkable display of memory not devoted to legal precedent, their grades. Lets see, he said. Weve got Liza going into fifth grade. Keegans in fifth. Annas in seventh. Shawnee is in seventh. Quinn is in sixth. Sophie is in seventh. So I think I got it all right. The room broke out into applause. In documents obtained by The New York Times that date back to Judge Kavanaughs time in the George W. Bush administration, Mr. Kavanaugh, then a White House aide, seemed to raise doubts about whether Roe v. Wade, the landmark Supreme Court ruling that found a constitutional right to an abortion, was settled law. He was considering a draft opinion piece to be run under the names of anti-abortion women that stated, it is widely accepted by legal scholars across the board that Roe v. Wade and its progeny are the settled law of the land. Responding to the email, the future Supreme Court nominee wrote, I am not sure that all legal scholars refer to Roe as the settled law of the land at the Supreme Court level since Court can always overrule its precedent, and three current Justices on the Court would do so. Advertisement The documents do not indicate how Judge Kavanaugh would rule, but they are fodder for Democratic questioning. Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, asked Mr. Kavanaugh about the document, noting it had been made public. Mr. Kavanaugh defended the statement he made in the email, and said the broader point was simply that it was overstating something about legal scholars. Im always concerned about accuracy, and I thought it was not an accurate description of all legal scholars, he said, adding later that Roe v. Wade is an important precedent. It has been reaffirmed many times. He declined to comment directly on Ms. Feinsteins questions as to whether it is correct law. NARAL Pro-Choice America, the abortion rights lobby, jumped on the release immediately: Brett Kavanaughs emails are rock solid evidence that he has been hiding his true beliefs and if he is given a lifetime seat on the Supreme Court, he will gut Roe v. Wade, criminalize abortion, and punish women. Everything he said yesterday in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee about settled law was nothing but a show to mislead the Senate. [Read more about the documents, here.] A tantalizing moment on Wednesday came when Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, asked Judge Kavanaugh whether he had meetings with Manuel Miranda, a former Senate Republican aide who was caught stealing files from the computers of Senate Judiciary Committee Democrats, including Mr. Leahy. Judge Kavanaugh denied ever knowingly receiving stolen material when he was a White House aide tasked with getting President George W. Bushs judicial nominees confirmed. On Thursday, questioning Judge Kavanaugh a second time, Mr. Leahy described and put up on posters several emails about his interactions with Mr. Miranda, indicating that he had received permission from the committee chairman around 3 a.m. to disclose them. They included a March 2003 email from Mr. Miranda to Judge Kavanaugh that included several pages of Democratic talking points, marked not for distribution, and another to Judge Kavanaugh from a Republican Senate staff member whose subject line spying and which referred to a mole for us on the left. 
            Subject: spying pic.twitter.com/GuIGHCjwiE  Judge Kavanaugh reiterated that he had no knowledge that Mr. Miranda had infiltrated Democratic files, saying he likely assumed that the Republican staff was getting information from friends who were Democratic staff members and nothing had raised red flags at the time. Advertisement I was born at night but not last night, Mr. Leahy said. If I had something that somebody said, we have stolen this or dont tell anybody we have this, I think it would raise some red flags. Mr. Leahy also pressed him about more than 100,000 documents from his period as a Bush White House lawyer that the Senate has not been permitted to see, even on a confidential basis, because a lawyer for President Bush has said they are subject to executive privilege. Mr. Leahy asked whether Judge Kavanaugh could confirm that none of those contain more such emails from Mr. Miranda.  Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter. You must select a newsletter to subscribe to. View all New York Times newsletters. Senator, I am not involved in the documents process, Judge Kavanaugh. I dont know whats in them. Replied Mr. Leahy: That is convenient. Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, pressed Mr. Kavanaugh on comments he made in support of Justice Antonin Scalias dissent in a case that upheld the constitutionality of an independent counsel. Given your views on Morrison v. Olson, we are obviously worried you will feel bound by this dissent by Scalia if President Trump decides to attempt to fire the special counsel Bob Mueller, Mr. Durbin said. Mr. Kavanaugh began by pushing back on the framing of Mr. Durbins question, noting that case involved the creation of an independent counsel, not a special counsel. But ultimately, he assured the senator, Ive made clear in my writing that when a court order requires a president to do something or prohibits a president from doing something under the constitution or laws of the United States, that is the final word. When it comes to the scope of executive power, he said, I am one not afraid at all in my record of twelve years to invalidate executive power when it violates the law. Later, under questioning from Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware, Judge Kavanaugh pushed back against what he called a misinterpretation of a comment he made at a 1999 round table, when he said, Maybe Nixon was wrongly decided  heresy though it is to say so. He was referring to the 1974 case of United States v. Nixon, where the Supreme Courts ruled unanimously that a sitting president, Richard M. Nixon, could be subpoenaed for documents and records like the Watergate tape recordings. Judge Kavanaugh said he was being wry, and critiquing the strategy of lawyers for President Bill Clinton during the investigation of that president. The tone of voice there has made the printed word look much different than how it was intended, he said, adding that he believes the case was correctly decided, and is one of the four greatest decisions in Supreme Court history. (He did not say what the other three are.) Advertisement Much of the morning was given to what appeared to be real drama, the move by Senator Cory Booker, Democrat of New Jersey, to release committee confidential documents without Republican permission  and Republican threats to exact consequences. After all, such a release could result in Mr. Bookers expulsion from Senate. Bring it, the senator said. Senators Booker and Mazie K. Hirono, Democrat of Hawaii, went ahead and released the documents. This is about the closest Ill ever come in my life to an I am Spartacus moment, Mr. Booker declared. But after the drama subsided, Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said all of those documents were cleared for release overnight. William A. Burck, the former Bush White House lawyer tasked with reviewing the Kavanaugh documents, said in a statement, We cleared the documents last night shortly after Senator Bookers staff asked us to. We were surprised to learn about Senator Bookers histrionics this morning because we had already told him he could use the documents publicly. In fact, we have said yes to every request made by the Senate Democrats to make documents public. The question remains, so why were Republicans handing Mr. Booker his moment, not saying, hey, whats the big deal? As for Mr. Booker, his spokeswoman gave him credit for forcing the documents release  and said this would not be the last of the document kerfuffles. Cory and Senate Democrats were able to shame the committee into agreeing to make last nights documents publicly available, and Cory publicly released those documents as well as other committee confidential documents today, the spokeswoman, Kristin Lynch, said in a statement. And hell keep releasing them because Republicans are hiding Brett Kavanaughs record from the American people. Advertisement Late in Wednesdays proceedings, the questioning finally reached Senator Kamala Harris, Democrat of California, and she launched into tense questioning that centered around whether Judge Kavanaugh had ever discussed the Russia investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, with a lawyer or lawyers from the law firm of President Trumps longtime personal lawyer, Marc Kasowitz. 
            Has Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh had a conversation about Robert Mueller or his investigation with anyone at Trump's personal attorney's law firm?We dont know. He refused to answer my question. pic.twitter.com/PAKxDGvEtZ  Judge Kavanaugh appeared somewhat baffled, but he would not offer a blanket no because he said he didnt know the names of every lawyer who worked for the firm, and he had discussed the Mueller investigation with lawyers and judges. I think youre thinking of someone, and you dont want to tell us, Ms. Harris said without elaboration. Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, gave Judge Kavanaugh an opportunity on Thursday to revisit Ms. Harriss line of questioning. Mr. Kavanaugh responded by acknowledging he doesnt know everyone who works at the firm, but said, I dont recall any conversations of that kind. I havent had any inappropriate conversations about that investigation with anyone, Judge Kavanaugh said. Ive never given anyone any winks, hints, forecasts, previews, nothing, about my view as a judge, or how I would rule as a judge on that or anything related to that. A spokesman for Kasowitz Benson Torres said in a statement Thursday that there have been no discussions regarding Robert Muellers investigation between Judge Kavanaugh and anyone at our firm. In a letter last June to Mr. Mueller, Mr. Kasowitz cited a majority opinion by Judge Kavanaugh, without naming him, saying, The President may decline to prosecute certain violators of federal law just as the President may pardon certain violators of federal law. The President may decline to prosecute or may pardon because of the Presidents own constitutional concerns about a law or because of policy objections to the law, among other reasons. The question is, can and will the senator tell the public what she knows? Most Supreme Court nominees express enthusiasm for cameras in the court at their confirmation hearings, only to change their minds after they join the court. Judge Kavanaugh took a different approach, saying only that I will have an open mind on it. Advertisement He said his current court, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, has recently allowed live audio coverage of its arguments. That development, he said, was a positive one. But he offered only vague comments on electronic coverage of the Supreme Court. The court generally releases audio recording of arguments at the end of the week and does not allow camera coverage. Judge Kavanaugh made one novel suggestion, offering that the court should consider camera coverage of the sessions in which the justices summarize their opinions from the bench. The court, which currently releases audio of those sessions months later, is unlikely to adopt the idea. The justices may be wary of suggesting to the public that their informal oral summaries, rather than their written opinions, precisely set out the details of decisions.

By Katherine Stewart Ms. Stewart is the author of The Good News Club: The Christian Rights Stealth Assault on Americas Children. On day two of the confirmation hearings for Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh, President Trumps second nominee to the Supreme Court, Senator John Cornyn of Texas brought up the 2000 case Santa Fe Independent School District v. Doe, in which the court ruled that sectarian prayers at high school football games violated the clause of the First Amendment that prohibits the establishment of religion. Mr. Cornyn repeated Chief Justice William H. Rehnquists complaint that the decision bristle[d] with hostility to all things religious in public life. In fact, the plaintiffs in the case identified as Catholic and Mormon, and it is safe to say that they were not hostile to religion, but to the presumption that one religion speaks for all. Judge Kavanaugh, eager to signal his agreement with Mr. Cornyn, tossed back the catch phrase that Mr. Cornyn appeared to be fishing for: religious liberty. Over the course of this weeks Senate confirmation hearings, the other senator from Texas, Ted Cruz, repeatedly identified Judge Kavanaugh as a jurist who would uphold religious liberty. That should concern anyone who cares about actual freedom, religious and otherwise. What senators Cornyn, Cruz and other religious conservatives mean by religious liberty is its opposite. If the Senate confirms Brett Kavanaugh, it will be declaring that the United States is a nation in which one brand of religion enjoys a place of privilege; that we are a nation of laws  except in cases where the law offends those who subscribe to our preferred religion; and that we recognize the dignity of all people unless they belong to specific groups our national religion views with disapproval. When a pharmacist refuses to fill a prescription on the basis of his own religious beliefs, according to todays Christian nationalists, that is a shining example of religious liberty. It is not. When a Catholic hospital delays or refuses to perform a legal and medically indicated procedure on a woman suffering a miscarriage on the grounds that the procedure violates its religious directives, that isnt religious liberty. When a private school that miseducates students with scientifically illiterate and historically inaccurate theories claims a public subsidy, or a Medicare-supported retirement home turns away a lesbian couple, that isnt religious liberty, either. Lets call it by its true name: religious privilege, not religious liberty. Todays Christian nationalists want the ability to override the law where it conflicts with their religious beliefs, and thus to withdraw from the social contract that binds the rest of us together as a nation. This kind of religious privilege has a history. In the Jim Crow south, for example, when black doctors and black patients were routinely shunted to inferior hospitals, many people justified the practice in terms of their sincerely held biblical belief that God intended for the races to be forever separated. Religious privilege of this sort was never intended for all belief systems, but rather for one type of religion. Sure, its advocates will on occasion rope in representatives of non-Christian faiths to lend the illusion of principle to their cause. But the real aim and effect of the religious liberty movement is to advance their idea of religion at the expense of everyone else. If your religion or deeply held moral beliefs include the view that all people should be treated with equal dignity, then this religious liberty wont do anything for you. If youre a taxpayer who helps to fund your local hospital, a patient who keeps it in business, or a professional who works there, then your sincerely held religious and moral conviction that all people are entitled to equal access to the best medicine that science can provide and the law permits wont stand a chance against a Catholic bishops conviction that some procedures are forbidden by a higher authority. Todays Christian nationalists will insist they are the only victims here. But that is as false as it is lacking in compassion. The terribly real effect of the kind of religious supremacy they seek is to target specific groups of people as legitimate objects of contempt. L.G.B.T. Americans, women and members of non-favored religions may be able to get the services they need from some other pharmacist or cake decorator or retirement home or emergency room  at least we have to hope so. But what they wont get back is the equal dignity to which they are entitled  and thats the point. President Trump, as part of his kickback to the white evangelicals who got him elected, has fashioned this idea of religious supremacy into a cornerstone of his shambolic administration. In January 2018, the Department of Health and Human Services set up an office designed to make it easier for health care professionals to deprive their clients of medical services, including birth control and other forms of reproductive care, on the basis of religious belief. In July, Attorney General Jeff Sessions followed up with his own Religious Liberty Task Force. Already the Department of Labor is assuring federal contractors that its all right to violate anti-discrimination law as long as they can claim they did it on account of an implicitly defined set of religious or deeply held moral beliefs. All of these detestable initiatives, however, are really just a preview of the damage Brett Kavanaugh would be able to deliver from the Supreme Court. To understand the significance of Judge Kavanaughs nomination, you have to know something about how he got to this crowning point in his career. Judge Kavanaugh comes from a hothouse carefully tended by the ideologues of the Federalist Society and given the stamp of approval by Mr. Trumps court evangelicals and conservative Catholics. Having lost the so-called culture war on womens and L.G.B.T. rights among the general public, Christian nationalists understand that the only way for their regressive views to dominate is if they control the courts. The confirmation process brought to you by todays Republican Party only serves to confirm the antidemocratic nature of Judge Kavanaughs appointment. Republicans defaulted on their Constitutional obligation to advise and consent on the nomination of Judge Merrick Garland. But now they are aiming to push Judge Kavanaughs through without anything close to a full revelation of his documentary trail. The part of the trail that is visible confirms that Judge Kavanaughs theoconservative backers have chosen a candidate who will advance their agenda. There was a time when Thomas Jeffersons wall of separation between church and state was part of the furniture of American constitutional thought. Only a grumbling minority talked about tearing it down. But in a recent speech, Judge Kavanaugh seized on a dissenting opinion in which his judicial hero, Justice Rehnquist, argued that the wall metaphor was based on bad history and useless as a guide to judging. In his dissenting opinion in Priests for Life v. Health and Human Services, Judge Kavanaugh argued that requiring an organization to fill out a one-page form that would have exempted it from providing contraception coverage imposed a substantial burden on its free exercise of religion. He appears to feel keenly the anguish of priests and nuns living in a nation where women have a range of lawfully and medically supported health care options. But in Garza v. Hargan, he thought it was no real burden for a minor, pregnant and in federal custody, to be denied access to the abortion she desperately wanted in order for the government to search for a sponsor, rather than arrange for her medical treatment directly. In that same decision  thankfully slapped down by the full bench of the court on which he sat  Judge Kavanaugh characterized abortion as a momentous life decision and referred contemptuously to abortion rights as abortion on demand. That is precisely how religious liberty works today. You maximize the moral anguish of those whose religion and values you favor and minimize the rights and suffering of those you disfavor. Judge Kavanaughs performance in his confirmation hearings served only to amplify these concerns. In answer to Mr. Cruzs invitation to discuss religious liberty, Judge Kavanaugh spoke movingly about the suffering of those who were prevented from bringing their religion into the public square. But he had next to nothing to say about the benefits that have flowed to all of us from the many landmark decisions that have prevented religious groups from using the power of the state to impose their views. He endorsed the appeal to history and tradition in justifying the mixing of religion and government functions, but showed no awareness that such appeals invariably confer privilege on those religions best able to claim this history for themselves. He celebrated recent rulings that establish the right of religious groups to participate in public programs, but failed to note that the concerns those rulings raise have to do with the use of taxpayer funds by religious groups whose beliefs are not universally shared  and whose discriminatory practices are at odds with laws that apply to the rest of the nonprofit (and for-profit) world. In response to Mr. Cornyn, Judge Kavanaugh gave favorable mention to the Supreme Court decision in the Good News Club v. Milford Central School case. At one time, public elementary schools largely excluded these clubs in response to Establishment Clause concerns. The Good News decision required the schools to open their doors to evangelical clubs, which gives young children the false but unavoidable impression that their school endorses one religion above all others. For Judge Kavanaugh, who wrote an amicus brief in the case while in private practice, this was a victory for religious liberty, presumably available to all other religions. But in the real world, few other religious groups have thought it appropriate to emulate the Good News Clubs strategy in going after other peoples elementary-age children in their public schools. And those who have tested identical strategies  the Satanic Temple tried it in 2016  have effectively had the school doors slammed in their faces. Judge Kavanaughs disdain for the separation of church and state will matter in decisions that go well beyond the usual battlegrounds in the culture war. He has expressed enthusiastic support for school voucher programs, for example, which are ways of pretending to reform education while funneling money from the public purse to religious organizations. Judge Kavanaughs record shows he also has a special place in his heart for the mystical belief systems of corporations. He endorsed the Hobby Lobby decision, which allowed that corporation to use its religious beliefs to deny birth control coverage to its employees. There is another vision of America, one where we come together as a people to solve as many of the problems that we face as we can. In an America that must still exist somewhere in our collective imagination, no group of individuals is singled out to be stripped of their dignity. In this America, we treat everybody equally under the law and we expect everyone to follow it. Citizens are free to exercise their religion, but not to impose it on other people or to fund it at public expense. The choice before the Senate is whether we continue to advance this vision of an open and tolerant America or stamp this low moment in our political history on the highest court of the land.

SHEARSEPT. 5, 2018
 Judge Brett Kavanaugh faced questions from the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath about his legal opinions on major issues.  Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee for the second day of his Supreme Court confirmation hearings, where he defended his judicial independence amid questions over how he would treat President Trump on the high court.  Senators have pressed Judge Kavanaugh on guns, abortion and regulation, as well as some tantalizing questions over purloined emails. Each senator has 30 minutes to interrogate Judge Kavanaugh. Protests continued intermittently.  For more analysis of the day, read here. Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, raised two Bush-era scandals with Judge Kavanaugh, and he suggested that Bush White House emails in the Judiciary Committees possession may contradict testimony the nominee made more than a decade ago  if only they could be released publicly. The exchange was tantalizing but incomplete. One of the scandals was the disclosure in late 2003 and 2004 that a Republican Judiciary Committee staff member had infiltrated the Democrats confidential internal files about which of President George W. Bushs judicial nominees to try to block and with what tactics. The other was the disclosure that after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, the Bush administration had secretly ordered the National Security Agency to intercept Americans phone calls and emails without obtaining the judicial warrants seemingly required by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Advertisement At his appeals court confirmation hearing in 2006, Judge Kavanaugh  who had worked as an associate White House counsel in the Bush administration  told senators that he did not know anything about the infiltration of Senate Democrats files on judicial nomination fights or about the warrantless wiretapping program before they eventually became public. Advertisement But Mr. Leahy indicated that documents marked committee confidential show that Manuel Miranda, then a Republican staffer on the Judiciary Committee, had sent Judge Kavanaugh emails about Mr. Leahys private concerns about a judicial nominee whose hearing was coming up and a draft letter Mr. Leahy had not yet sent. He also suggested that the files may show that Mr. Miranda made a reference to having a mole on the committee or spying on Democrats, and that Mr. Miranda may have suggested meeting outside of their workplaces. The senator also indicated that Mr. Kavanaugh may have had some involvement with a memo written by John Yoo, who was an attorney in the Justice Departments Office of Legal Counsel who wrote opinions secretly blessing the surveillance program as lawful. Judge Kavanaugh insisted that everything he had testified before was 100 percent accurate, but indicated that he was not sure what Mr. Leahy was referring to. Mr. Leahy asked Mr. Grassley to lift the confidentiality protections over the emails in question so he and Judge Kavanaugh could discuss them in his second round of questioning, and Mr. Grassley indicated he would look at them. I am concerned because there is evidence that Mr. Miranda provided you with materials that were stolen from me, Mr. Leahy said. And that would contradict your prior testimony. It is also clear from public emails  and Im refraining from going into nonpublic ones  that you had reason to believe materials were obtained inappropriately at the time. Judge Kavanaugh, under attack from progressives and Democrats who say he will roll back abortion rights, asserted that he understood the significance of the issue and would respect the Supreme Courts precedent on precedent. I dont live in a bubble. I understand I live in the real world, he said, after Ms. Feinstein reminded him of the death tolls in this country among women who tried to end their own pregnancies before Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 decision establishing a constitutional right to abortion. I understand your point of view on that and I understand how passionate and how deeply people feel about this issue, he said. Senator Feinstein did not ask him the operative question  Does he believe Roe was correctly decided?  but even if she had, he had already told Senator Grassley it would not be appropriate to answer it. She did ask him what he meant when he told Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, that he believed Roe was settled law. At that, he launched into a discourse on the value of precedent. Advertisement Judge Kavanaugh said that Roe was settled as a precedent of the Supreme Court, and as such, deserves respect from judges who took note of it. But then he noted a subsequent case, the 1992 case of Planned Parenthood v. Casey, which narrowed the scope of Roe, at the same time that it reaffirmed Roe as a precedent. Casey, which gave states the authority to regulate abortion so long as those regulations do not pose an undue burden on the woman, is precedent on precedent, he said. His comments were a reminder that, as Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader, has often pointed out, precedents are only settled law until the Supreme Court unsettles them. Democrats complain that previous nominees have pledged to respect precedents, only to narrow or overturn them once seated on the court. One opinion of intense interest to Democrats is Judge Kavanaughs dissent in the 2017 case Garza v. Hargan, which involved a pregnant, 17-year-old undocumented immigrant whom the Trump administration tried to block from having an immediate abortion. Judge Kavanaugh sided with the administration in arguing that the teen should have been transferred to the care of an immigration sponsor  a family member or friend  before being allowed terminate her pregnancy. Under questioning from Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, he said he was only following Supreme Court precedent, though he conceded, There is no case on exact point. So, Judge Kavanaugh said, he rooted his dissent in Supreme Court cases that have permitted states to require pregnant teens to obtain the consent of their parents for an abortion. Mr. Durbin objected, suggesting that Texas, where the girl was housed in an immigration facility, had imposed no such requirement on her. You are adding a requirement here, the senator said. Im not adding. Im a judge. The policy has been made by others, Judge Kavanaugh replied. Im deciding whether the policy is consistent with Supreme Court precedent. I did my level best in an emergency posture, he added. Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, put that question directly to Judge Kavanaugh. Advertisement If Mr. Leahy thought he was going to get a direct answer to the direct question, he was mistaken. 
            Leahy: ""President Trump claims he has an absolute right to pardon himself. Does he?""Kavanaugh: ""The question of self-pardons is something I've never analyzed. It's a question I have not written about... It's a hypothetical question that I can't begin to answer in this context"" pic.twitter.com/N91BYOuqKV  The question of self pardons is something Ive never analyzed, Judge Kavanaugh said, adding: I cant begin to answer in this context as a sitting judge and a nominee to the Supreme Court. Mr. Leahy pressed anyway, asking whether the president could pardon associates to keep them from testifying against him. Again, Judge Kavanaugh dodged the question, saying that as a judge, he would normally receive briefs and arguments from both sides before coming to a conclusion. Im not going to answer hypothetical questions of that sort, he said. Pressed by Ms. Feinstein, Judge Kavanaugh refused to say whether he would rule that the Constitution permits a sitting president to be subpoenaed for testimony. He said that as a matter of judicial independence, he would not give the Senate a precise answer on a hypothetical that might come before me. 
            Sen. Feinstein: ""Can a sitting president be required to respond to a subpoena?"" Kavanaugh: ""As a matter of the canons of judicial independence, I can't give you an answer on that hypothetical question."" pic.twitter.com/cQhxUmxJH9  The potential for a legal fight over a presidential subpoena has become a hot topic amid speculation that Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel investigating Russias interference in the 2016 campaign, may issue a subpoena for President Trump. Lawyers for the president and the office of the special counsel have been negotiating for months over whether Mr. Trump will voluntarily sit for an interview, so far without success. In 1974, the Supreme Court unanimously ruled in United States v. Nixon that a sitting president  in that case Richard M. Nixon  could be subpoenaed for documents and records like the Watergate tape recordings. But the court has never addressed the question of whether a sitting president could be forced to answer questions, which raises additional issues about the time it would take to prepare and the potential distraction from carrying out his constitutional duties. Noting that Chief Justice Warren Burger, who wrote the ruling, had been appointed by President Nixon, Judge Kavanaugh said he thought the Watergate tapes ruling was one of the greatest moments in the Supreme Courts history because it stood up for judicial independence in the face of political pressure, but how that precedent would apply to other hypotheticals  like whether a subpoena for presidential testimony in a criminal investigation should also be upheld  was something he should not address, citing the practice of previous Supreme Court nominees. Judge Kavanaugh was a prosecutor working for Ken Starr when the independent counsel issued a subpoena to Mr. Clinton. But Mr. Clintons legal team negotiated a deal whereby he testified voluntarily before a grand jury, and Mr. Starr withdrew the subpoena, so the issue was never adjudicated. Years later, after working in the Bush administration after the Sept. 11 attacks, Judge Kavanaugh said that he thought presidents should be temporarily shielded from criminal investigation while they were in office, although he left it ambiguous as to whether he thought that was a change Congress should make or that the Constitution might already allow. Answering the very first question on Wednesday, from Senator Grassley, the Judiciary Committee chairman, Judge Kavanaugh said he would be an independent justice. He cited three Supreme Court landmarks to make his case. Advertisement Two were predictable: Brown v. Board of Education, the 1954 decision that ruled segregated public schools unconstitutional, and Youngstown Sheet and Tube Company v. Sawyer, the 1952 decision rejecting President Harry S. Trumans attempt to seize the nations steel mills to aid the war effort in Korea. The third was notable: United States v. Nixon, the 1974 decision in which Supreme Court unanimously ruled that President Nixon had to comply with a subpoena seeking tapes of his conversations in the Oval Office. Will a Supreme Court with two Trump-appointed justices overrule the right to an abortion? Its possible, but not the most likely outcome. Adam Liptak, The Timess Supreme Court reporter, explains. Judge Kavanaugh has not always been unequivocal in his support for the decision. In a 1999 transcript of a round-table discussion, he said, Maybe Nixon was wrongly decided  heresy though it is to say so. His allies have said he meant the statement as a critique of the legal strategy of President Bill Clintons lawyers. On Wednesday, Judge Kavanaughs said the message of the decision, which he called one of the greatest moments in American judicial history, was clear. No one is above the law in our constitutional system, he said. An abstract but important part of Judge Kavanaughs judicial philosophy is his skeptical approach to so-called Chevron deference, the principle that when a statute granting a regulatory agency the authority to make rules about a certain topic  such as protections for the environment, consumers, or workers  are ambiguous, the courts should accept the agencys interpretation that it has the power to make a rule.

Corporations opposed to what they see as overly burdensome regulations want the Supreme Court to overturn or narrow the Chevron ruling, making it harder for executive agencies to expand into new areas. Questioned about his view of the powers of administrative agencies by Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, Judge Kavanaugh touted several rulings in which he had upheld environmental regulations rather than striking them down, but he gave little sign of support for Chevron deference, insisting instead that executive branch agencies must not be permitted to rewrite laws passed by Congress to expand its authority. Ive heard it said that Im a skeptic of regulation, he said. Im not a skeptic of regulation at all. Im a skeptic of unauthorized regulation, of illegal regulation, of regulation that is outside the bounds of what the laws passed by Congress have said. Back in 2006, Judge Kavanaugh testified during his appeals court confirmation that he was not involved in the questions about the rules governing detention of combatants while working in a George W. Bush White House that was wrestling with the handling of terrorism suspects. Advertisement Instead, he said, his portfolio focused on civil justice issues like terrorism insurance. Mr. Durbin was having none of it. It has since emerged that Judge Kavanaugh was involved in a Bush White House discussion about whether American citizens being held as enemy combatants should get access to lawyers, the senator said, and that the nominee had volunteered to prepare a Justice Department official for testimony about monitoring attorney-client conversations of terrorism-related federal inmates. He also said Judge Kavanaugh had privately admitted involvement in a December 2005 signing statement by President Bush that asserted a right to bypass a newly tightened torture ban. You went further than you should have, Mr. Durbin said. In the three specific instances I gave you, you clearly were involved in questions about rules governing detention of combatants. But Judge Kavanaugh defended his testimony as accurate. Among other things, he said his statement that he was not involved  which came in response to a question 12 years ago from Mr. Durbin  was a reference to the Bush administrations so-called enhanced interrogation program, not terrorism prisoners generally. I was not read into that program, he said. I told the truth about that. He also said that while, as White House staff secretary in December 2005, he passed the torture ban signing statement onto Mr. Bush for his signature, it was the White House counsel  Harriet Miers  who controlled the text of that document. I cant recall what I said about the torture ban signing statement, Judge Kavanaugh said. I do recall that there was a good deal of internal debate about that signing statement, as you can imagine there would be. I remember that it was controversial internally. The second day of Judge Kavanaughs hearings started with still more protests  just as Senator Grassley opened with a hope that the proceedings would be under more control than Tuesdays divisive opening. One woman was led out shouting sham president, sham justice. In his opening remarks, Mr. Grassley accused Democrats  who strategized for the hearing on a conference call Monday  of colluding with protesters to disrupt the hearing. NBC News reported that Democratic members of the committee plotted with minority leaders to disrupt the hearing yesterday, he said. Democratic senators interrupted the hearing 63 times before lunch, and in the audience, 70 people were arrested yesterday who were following their lead. But one of the protesters took exception to Mr. Grassleys assertion, since, she said, she was calling out Democratic leaders such as Mr. Durbin for their tepid efforts to thwart the nominee. And a spokesman for Mr. Schumer said there was no coordination. Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh, President Trumps nominee to the Supreme Court, appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee for the first day of his confirmation hearing. In the 1990s, as a prosecutor in Mr. Starrs Monica Lewinsky investigation, Judge Kavanaugh supported aggressive questioning of former President Bill Clinton about his sexual relations with the former White House intern. Advertisement Years later, however, Mr. Kavanaugh expressed regret about that view, suggesting that sitting presidents should not be subjected to the kind of distracting investigations that helped subject Mr. Clinton to as part of the Starr investigation. That shift in views has prompted Democrats to assert that Mr. Kavanaugh would try to protect Mr. Trump from Mr. Muellers Russia investigation. Ms. Feinstein pressed Judge Kavanaugh on that point on Wednesday. Mr. Kavanaugh said his views changed after he watched former President George W. Bush deal with the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and their aftermath, and concluded that presidents should not be distracted from important crises like that by having to respond to investigations such as the one that Mr. Clinton faced. September 11  thats what changed, he told Ms. Feinstein. He added, however, that his comments about potential changes to the statutes governing investigations of presidents do not reflect his thinking on the question of whether the Constitution would allow such investigations to proceed. If a case came up where someone was trying to say this was a constitutional principle, I would have a completely open mind on that, he said. Critics of Judge Kavanaugh have noted that he clerked for a former 9th Circuit Court of Appeals judge, Alex Kozinski, who has been accused of sexually harassing more than a dozen women. They assert that Mr. Kavanaugh must have known about the allegations long before they were made public. Advertisement Senator Hatch came to Judge Kavanaughs defense, calling such accusations against Mr. Kavanaugh guilt by association, but asked a series of gentle questions designed to give the judge an opportunity to deny them. He did just that, seeking to put distance between himself and any hint that he knew of or condoned the judges behavior. Did you know anything about these allegations against Judge Kozinski? Mr. Hatch asked. Nothing, Mr. Kavanaugh responded, adding a moment later: When they became public, the first thought I had was no woman should be subjected to harassment in the workplace, including in the judiciary, especially in the judiciary. He went on: It was a gut punch for me. It was a gut punch for the judiciary. I was shocked, disappointed, angry  swirl of emotions. Ove rall, Judge Kavanaugh has gone out of his way to extol his record on women. He said he has made an aggressive effort to hire female clerks. Twenty-five of the 48 clerks that Judge Kavanaugh has hired during his 12 years on the appeals court have been women, and 21 have gone on to clerk at the Supreme Court, he told the committee. He said he was spurred to do so by an article in The New York Times by Linda Greenhouse, the newspapers former Supreme Court correspondent, who wrote in 2006, the same year Judge Kavanaugh joined the court, about the paucity of female clerks on the Supreme Court. Judge Kavanaugh said that troubled him, calling it unacceptable. He hired three women (out of four clerks) for his first year on the bench, adding that the next generation of leaders and Supreme Court justices will be drawn from the ranks of that generation. Its something Im very focused on at all times, he said. Judge Kavanaugh held up his ruling in a 2012 appeals court case reversing the military commissions conviction of a former Guantnamo detainee, Salim Hamdan, as evidence that he would be independent and could resist public and political pressure when it came to deciding cases. Mr. Hamdan, a Yemeni man who served as a driver and bodyguard to the Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden had been convicted in 2008 before a military commission on a charge of providing material support for terrorism. His lawyers challenged the conviction on the grounds that material support was not a recognized international war crime at the time of his actions, and tribunals are generally for war crimes. The Military Commissions Act of 2006 listed that charge as a war crime that the tribunals could handle, but Judge Kavanaugh and the appeals court ruled that it did not apply retroactively and overturned the conviction. You will never have a nominee who has ruled for a more unpopular defendant than ruling for Salim Hamdan, Judge Kavanaugh said. And why did I do that in that case? Why did I rule for someone who had been involved in the September 11th? Its because the law compelled it. Still, Mr. Hamdan, who had already served his sentence and been repatriated back to Yemen by 2012, was not accused of advance knowledge of or involvement in the September 11 attacks. And in many other important cases involving Guantnamo detainees, Judge Kavanaugh sided with the government  including ruling in ways that made it harder for detainees to win habeas corpus lawsuits challenging the basis for their indefinite wartime detention without trial; arguing that the appeals court had no jurisdiction to hear challenges brought by military commissions defendants before the tribunal issued a final judgment; and maintaining that international law cannot be enforced in court as a constraint against what Congress and the president do with tribunals.

The court order forces a witness to appear to give testimony.  In a second day of Senate hearings, Brett Kavanaugh said no-one was above the law but he would not be drawn on what he called a hypothetical question.  He also declined to say if he thought presidents could pardon themselves. The BBC's Gary O'Donoghue, in Washington, says the investigation into alleged collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia in the 2016 election has raised important constitutional questions about the extent to which an incumbent president can be forced to co-operate.  Democrats are keen to push Mr Kavanaugh on the issue, he adds. Mr Kavanaugh, 53, who faces a four-day confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, was also pressed on his approach to gun rights and the law around abortion. He said he understood the importance of the precedent in the landmark 1973 case, Roe v Wade, which legalised abortion nationwide, pointing out it had been reaffirmed by the Supreme Court several times. If confirmed, the conservative appeals court judge would be expected to tilt the court's balance to the right.  Chuck Grassley, the Republican chairman of the Judiciary Committee, asked Mr Kavanaugh whether he would have any trouble ruling against the president who nominated him, to which he responded: ""No-one is above the law in our constitutional system."" ""I think the first quality of a good judge in our constitutional system is independence,"" he added. Senior Democrat Dianne Feinstein asked if he thought a sitting president could be ""required to respond to a subpoena"". ""I can't give you an answer on that hypothetical question,"" Mr Kavanaugh said. He gave a similar answer to Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy who asked whether a president could issue a pardon to himself or to someone else in exchange for promising not to testify against the president. In a tweet in June, President Trump said he had ""the absolute right to PARDON myself"". On abortion, Mr Kavanaugh said he understood people's strong feelings and he described Roe v Wade as ""an important precedent of the Supreme Court that has been reaffirmed many times"". Supporters of abortion rights fear Mr Kavanaugh could provide the decisive fifth vote on the nine-seat court to overturn the 1973 ruling. On the issue of gun rights, Senator Feinstein pressed Mr Kavanaugh on his previous opposition to a ban on semi-automatic rifles. Such weapons have been used in a string of deadly high school shootings. ""Of course the violence in the schools is something we all detest and want to do something about,"" Mr Kavanaugh said, but added that handguns and other semi-automatic weapons were also used for hunting and self-defence. For a second day, protesters interrupted proceedings before being removed by security personnel. On Tuesday, there were angry scenes minutes after Mr Kavanaugh entered the committee rooms. The hearing was disrupted by angry shouts from members of the public and lawmakers alike. Texas Republican John Cornyn said it was ""the first confirmation hearing for a Supreme Court justice I've seen basically according to mob rule"". The US Capitol Police said 61 people were removed from the committee room on Tuesday and arrested for disorderly conduct. Republicans have a slim majority in the 100-seat upper house. They can confirm Mr Kavanaugh if they stay united. So far, there are no signs of Republican defections.  Not all Democrats have said they will oppose Mr Kavanaugh, and several may even support his nomination.  The Senate is likely to vote on confirmation by the end of the month. The court begins its next term in October. He studied law at Yale and is a resident of the wealthy Washington suburb of Chevy Chase.  He worked under special counsel Kenneth Starr in his investigation into President Bill Clinton's relationship with intern Monica Lewinsky in the 1990s.  Under George W Bush, he served as deputy White House counsel and, from 2003-06, as Mr Bush's staff secretary.  A Catholic, he has been a US Court of Appeals judge in Washington for the past 11 years.  Brett Kavanaugh's nomination will go to a full US Senate vote but talks continue over an FBI inquiry.

 Senators on the Judiciary Committee pressed Judge Brett Kavanaugh about the constitutional right to abortion and his views on the special counsel.  The third day of confirmation hearings for the Supreme Court nominee Brett M. Kavanaugh, and the second day of senators questioning, began at 9:30 a.m. and stretched late into the night.  The release of documents once marked committee confidential fortified Democratic questions on abortion, affirmative action and whether Judge Kavanaugh knew of Republican aides theft of Democratic computer files.  Many of those confidential documents spilled out in an anonymous release to The New York Times. Judge Kavanaughs abortion views created a stir outside the hearing room. Adding to the concerns of abortion rights advocates was a Kavanaugh reference to contraceptives as abortion-inducing drugs. He was answering a question from Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, about his dissent in a case involving Priests for Life, a religious organization that objected to a regulation under the Affordable Care Act requiring many employers to provide free insurance coverage for contraception to their female workers. Advertisement The group had objected to an accommodation offered by the Obama administration that allowed it to obtain a waiver by completing a form. Advertisement They said filling out the form would make them complicit in the provision of the abortion inducing drugs that they were as a religious matter objecting to, Judge Kavanaugh testified. Some religious organizations regard any form of birth control as an abortifacient. But Judge Kavanaughs use of the term abortion-inducing drugs set off alarm bells among abortion rights advocates and spawned a hashtag, #abortioninducingdrugs, on Twitter. Erica Sackin, director of political communications for Planned Parenthood of America, commented on Twitter: 
            BIG FLAG: #Kavanaugh just called birth control ""abortion-inducing drugs""         Judge Kavanaugh would not say whether he thought the Supreme Courts 2015 decision establishing a constitutional right to same-sex marriage had been correctly decided. But he tried to convey sympathy for gay rights by quoting from a Supreme Court decision in June that sided with a Colorado baker who refused to create a wedding cake for a same-sex couple. The ruling did not address the central dispute in the case and turned instead on apparent hostility against religion in a state civil rights commission. Judge Kavanaugh focused on one statement in the majority opinion, written by Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, the member of the court he hopes to replace. Our society has come to the recognition that gay persons and gay couples cannot be treated as social outcasts or as inferior in dignity and worth, Justice Kennedy wrote. Judge Kavanaugh noted that Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justices Samuel A. Alito Jr. and Neil M. Gorsuch, all members of the courts conservative wing, had joined the opinion. And he suggested that he agreed with the sentiment, too. Amid the arcane discussions of Supreme Court precedent and judicial philosophy, the Kavanaugh hearings did have some lighter moments. Advertisement Senator John Kennedy, Republican of Louisiana, had some probing questions about Judge Kavanaughs past: Did you ever get in trouble? Were you more of a John Boy Walton type or a Ferris Bueller type? The judge didnt bite. Mr. Cruz asked Judge Kavanaugh if he intends to play basketball at the court inside the Supreme Court building. No sitting justice has played there, Mr. Cruz said, since Justice Clarence Thomas, many years ago, when he was a much younger justice. Judge Kavanaugh said that if confirmed, he does indeed intend to play, on what is known as the highest court in the land. And speaking of basketball, Judge Kavanaugh is exceedingly proud of the girls basketball teams he has coached through the Catholic Youth Organization at his home parish, Blessed Sacrament in Chevy Chase, Md. About a dozen current and former players  in blue sweaters, ponytails and plaid skirts  showed up to watch. They sat in the front rows, right behind their coach. Judge Kavanaugh introduced each of them, rattling off their names and, in a remarkable display of memory not devoted to legal precedent, their grades. Lets see, he said. Weve got Liza going into fifth grade. Keegans in fifth. Annas in seventh. Shawnee is in seventh. Quinn is in sixth. Sophie is in seventh. So I think I got it all right. The room broke out into applause. In documents obtained by The New York Times that date back to Judge Kavanaughs time in the George W. Bush administration, Mr. Kavanaugh, then a White House aide, seemed to raise doubts about whether Roe v. Wade, the landmark Supreme Court ruling that found a constitutional right to an abortion, was settled law. He was considering a draft opinion piece to be run under the names of anti-abortion women that stated, it is widely accepted by legal scholars across the board that Roe v. Wade and its progeny are the settled law of the land. Responding to the email, the future Supreme Court nominee wrote, I am not sure that all legal scholars refer to Roe as the settled law of the land at the Supreme Court level since Court can always overrule its precedent, and three current Justices on the Court would do so. Advertisement The documents do not indicate how Judge Kavanaugh would rule, but they are fodder for Democratic questioning. Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, asked Mr. Kavanaugh about the document, noting it had been made public. Mr. Kavanaugh defended the statement he made in the email, and said the broader point was simply that it was overstating something about legal scholars. Im always concerned about accuracy, and I thought it was not an accurate description of all legal scholars, he said, adding later that Roe v. Wade is an important precedent. It has been reaffirmed many times. He declined to comment directly on Ms. Feinsteins questions as to whether it is correct law. NARAL Pro-Choice America, the abortion rights lobby, jumped on the release immediately: Brett Kavanaughs emails are rock solid evidence that he has been hiding his true beliefs and if he is given a lifetime seat on the Supreme Court, he will gut Roe v. Wade, criminalize abortion, and punish women. Everything he said yesterday in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee about settled law was nothing but a show to mislead the Senate. [Read more about the documents, here.] A tantalizing moment on Wednesday came when Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, asked Judge Kavanaugh whether he had meetings with Manuel Miranda, a former Senate Republican aide who was caught stealing files from the computers of Senate Judiciary Committee Democrats, including Mr. Leahy. Judge Kavanaugh denied ever knowingly receiving stolen material when he was a White House aide tasked with getting President George W. Bushs judicial nominees confirmed. On Thursday, questioning Judge Kavanaugh a second time, Mr. Leahy described and put up on posters several emails about his interactions with Mr. Miranda, indicating that he had received permission from the committee chairman around 3 a.m. to disclose them. They included a March 2003 email from Mr. Miranda to Judge Kavanaugh that included several pages of Democratic talking points, marked not for distribution, and another to Judge Kavanaugh from a Republican Senate staff member whose subject line spying and which referred to a mole for us on the left. 
            Subject: spying pic.twitter.com/GuIGHCjwiE  Judge Kavanaugh reiterated that he had no knowledge that Mr. Miranda had infiltrated Democratic files, saying he likely assumed that the Republican staff was getting information from friends who were Democratic staff members and nothing had raised red flags at the time. Advertisement I was born at night but not last night, Mr. Leahy said. If I had something that somebody said, we have stolen this or dont tell anybody we have this, I think it would raise some red flags. Mr. Leahy also pressed him about more than 100,000 documents from his period as a Bush White House lawyer that the Senate has not been permitted to see, even on a confidential basis, because a lawyer for President Bush has said they are subject to executive privilege. Mr. Leahy asked whether Judge Kavanaugh could confirm that none of those contain more such emails from Mr. Miranda.  Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter. You must select a newsletter to subscribe to. View all New York Times newsletters. Senator, I am not involved in the documents process, Judge Kavanaugh. I dont know whats in them. Replied Mr. Leahy: That is convenient. Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, pressed Mr. Kavanaugh on comments he made in support of Justice Antonin Scalias dissent in a case that upheld the constitutionality of an independent counsel. Given your views on Morrison v. Olson, we are obviously worried you will feel bound by this dissent by Scalia if President Trump decides to attempt to fire the special counsel Bob Mueller, Mr. Durbin said. Mr. Kavanaugh began by pushing back on the framing of Mr. Durbins question, noting that case involved the creation of an independent counsel, not a special counsel. But ultimately, he assured the senator, Ive made clear in my writing that when a court order requires a president to do something or prohibits a president from doing something under the constitution or laws of the United States, that is the final word. When it comes to the scope of executive power, he said, I am one not afraid at all in my record of twelve years to invalidate executive power when it violates the law. Later, under questioning from Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware, Judge Kavanaugh pushed back against what he called a misinterpretation of a comment he made at a 1999 round table, when he said, Maybe Nixon was wrongly decided  heresy though it is to say so. He was referring to the 1974 case of United States v. Nixon, where the Supreme Courts ruled unanimously that a sitting president, Richard M. Nixon, could be subpoenaed for documents and records like the Watergate tape recordings. Judge Kavanaugh said he was being wry, and critiquing the strategy of lawyers for President Bill Clinton during the investigation of that president. The tone of voice there has made the printed word look much different than how it was intended, he said, adding that he believes the case was correctly decided, and is one of the four greatest decisions in Supreme Court history. (He did not say what the other three are.) Advertisement Much of the morning was given to what appeared to be real drama, the move by Senator Cory Booker, Democrat of New Jersey, to release committee confidential documents without Republican permission  and Republican threats to exact consequences. After all, such a release could result in Mr. Bookers expulsion from Senate. Bring it, the senator said. Senators Booker and Mazie K. Hirono, Democrat of Hawaii, went ahead and released the documents. This is about the closest Ill ever come in my life to an I am Spartacus moment, Mr. Booker declared. But after the drama subsided, Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said all of those documents were cleared for release overnight. William A. Burck, the former Bush White House lawyer tasked with reviewing the Kavanaugh documents, said in a statement, We cleared the documents last night shortly after Senator Bookers staff asked us to. We were surprised to learn about Senator Bookers histrionics this morning because we had already told him he could use the documents publicly. In fact, we have said yes to every request made by the Senate Democrats to make documents public. The question remains, so why were Republicans handing Mr. Booker his moment, not saying, hey, whats the big deal? As for Mr. Booker, his spokeswoman gave him credit for forcing the documents release  and said this would not be the last of the document kerfuffles. Cory and Senate Democrats were able to shame the committee into agreeing to make last nights documents publicly available, and Cory publicly released those documents as well as other committee confidential documents today, the spokeswoman, Kristin Lynch, said in a statement. And hell keep releasing them because Republicans are hiding Brett Kavanaughs record from the American people. Advertisement Late in Wednesdays proceedings, the questioning finally reached Senator Kamala Harris, Democrat of California, and she launched into tense questioning that centered around whether Judge Kavanaugh had ever discussed the Russia investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, with a lawyer or lawyers from the law firm of President Trumps longtime personal lawyer, Marc Kasowitz. 
            Has Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh had a conversation about Robert Mueller or his investigation with anyone at Trump's personal attorney's law firm?We dont know. He refused to answer my question. pic.twitter.com/PAKxDGvEtZ  Judge Kavanaugh appeared somewhat baffled, but he would not offer a blanket no because he said he didnt know the names of every lawyer who worked for the firm, and he had discussed the Mueller investigation with lawyers and judges. I think youre thinking of someone, and you dont want to tell us, Ms. Harris said without elaboration. Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, gave Judge Kavanaugh an opportunity on Thursday to revisit Ms. Harriss line of questioning. Mr. Kavanaugh responded by acknowledging he doesnt know everyone who works at the firm, but said, I dont recall any conversations of that kind. I havent had any inappropriate conversations about that investigation with anyone, Judge Kavanaugh said. Ive never given anyone any winks, hints, forecasts, previews, nothing, about my view as a judge, or how I would rule as a judge on that or anything related to that. A spokesman for Kasowitz Benson Torres said in a statement Thursday that there have been no discussions regarding Robert Muellers investigation between Judge Kavanaugh and anyone at our firm. In a letter last June to Mr. Mueller, Mr. Kasowitz cited a majority opinion by Judge Kavanaugh, without naming him, saying, The President may decline to prosecute certain violators of federal law just as the President may pardon certain violators of federal law. The President may decline to prosecute or may pardon because of the Presidents own constitutional concerns about a law or because of policy objections to the law, among other reasons. The question is, can and will the senator tell the public what she knows? Most Supreme Court nominees express enthusiasm for cameras in the court at their confirmation hearings, only to change their minds after they join the court. Judge Kavanaugh took a different approach, saying only that I will have an open mind on it. Advertisement He said his current court, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, has recently allowed live audio coverage of its arguments. That development, he said, was a positive one. But he offered only vague comments on electronic coverage of the Supreme Court. The court generally releases audio recording of arguments at the end of the week and does not allow camera coverage. Judge Kavanaugh made one novel suggestion, offering that the court should consider camera coverage of the sessions in which the justices summarize their opinions from the bench. The court, which currently releases audio of those sessions months later, is unlikely to adopt the idea. The justices may be wary of suggesting to the public that their informal oral summaries, rather than their written opinions, precisely set out the details of decisions.

Heres the sign-up.) Good evening. Heres the latest. 1. It was the first day of confirmation hearings for Judge Brett Kavanaughs appointment to the Supreme Court, and it started with a bang. Senate Democrats moved angrily to adjourn to consider tens of thousands of pages of documents released the night before the hearing. They were joined by crowds of protesters, who cried out their support. President Trumps potential legal troubles were a recurring theme, but Republicans praised Judge Kavanaugh and expressed confidence he will be confirmed. The hearings continue through the week. _____ 2. Voters in Massachusetts went to the polls today and elected Ayanna Pressley, 44, above, over 10-term Representative Michael Capuano in a Democratic primary that few said she could win. She is now poised to become the first African-American in the state to be elected to the House of Representatives. Separately, the White House and President Trump are rattled by a forthcoming book that portrays the administration as an out-of-control operation: crazytown, in the reported words of the chief of staff, John Kelly. According to the book, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said the president acted like  and had the understanding of  a fifth or sixth grader. Thats among the most explosive claims in Fear, by Bob Woodward, due out next week. The Times obtained a copy. _____ 3. Even after news that Colin Kaepernick had signed a multimillion-dollar deal with Nike and become a face of its Just Do It campaign, his silence is deafening. The former quarterback started kneeling in protest during the national anthem before N.F.L. games in 2016, and other players soon joined him. Their protest caused a huge outcry, dividing fans and the league owners, captivating celebrities and athletes and motivating President Trump to persistently tweet his anger over it. But Mr. Kaepernick is letting his social media savvy  and a total rejection of interviews  spin the message. _____ 4. $1,000,000,000,000. Amazon became the second American company to reach a market value of $1 trillion. Apple hit that milestone last month, but with Amazon, our reporter writes, the path has been much more complicated. Amazon has revolutionized how people shop  and taught retailers some hard lessons along the way. But theres also been a rise in its brick-and-mortar operations. _____ 5. Other tech giants are under scrutiny over the coming midterm elections. Executives from Facebook, Twitter and Google will testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Wednesday about their preparations to thwart foreign influence campaigns and disinformation. Sheryl Sandberg, Facebooks C.O.O., above. The power their platforms wield over public discourse is enormous. Temporarily barring Alex Jones of Infowars  who regularly spreads lies, conspiracy theories and inflammatory attacks against political enemies  drastically reduced his reach. Over the summer, Facebook announced the discovery of hundreds of fake pages and user accounts on its site. Can you tell the difference between a genuine Facebook post and one that was part of an influence campaign? Try your hand with our quiz. _____ 6. Another worry for Facebook: In Libya, it has become a platform for keyboard warriors who stoke violence. In the capital, where violence has broken out between rival militias in recent days, some combatants picked up rocket launchers. Others headed online. Keyboard warriors, as Facebook partisans are known in Libya, issued boasts, taunts and chilling threats online as their counterparts attacked from the ground. Some Facebook users even provided direct coordinates for targeted attacks. Facebook insists it is policing its Libyan platform, but illegal activity is rife. _____ 7. A replacement for John McCain: John Kyl, a former Arizona senator, will fill the seat, though he has committed to serving only until the start of the next Congress, in January. Mr. Kyl has been helping Judge Brett Kavanaugh through the confirmation process. In tapping him to fill it, Gov. Doug Ducey has effectively put the stature of Mr. McCains seat ahead of the political imperative of keeping it in Republican hands, our reporter writes. And in Chicago, Mayor Rahm Emanuel, above, announced he would not seek re-election. This has been the job of a lifetime, but it is not a job for a lifetime, he said. _____ 8. Tropical Storm Gordon is heading for the Gulf Coast and is poised to become the first hurricane to strike the continental United States this year. Its expected to intensify into a Category 1 hurricane before it makes landfall along the Gulf Coast late Tuesday or early Wednesday. Forecasters dont anticipate the kind of damage that Hurricane Harvey caused a year ago, but the governors of Alabama, Louisiana and Mississippi have all declared states of emergency. Well have live updates about the storm. _____ 9. News from the U.S. Open: Sloane Stephens, the defending champion, lost in the U.S. Open quarterfinals to Anastasija Sevastova, above, on Tuesday. Karolina Pliskova will take on Serena Williams this evening. Check back for live updates and results. And in case you missed it, Roger Federer lost last night to John Millman. He blamed the heat. (Yes, its still hot.) _____ 10. Finally, after 13 years, Dorothys ruby slippers have been found. One of the famous pairs Judy Garland wore in The Wizard of Oz was stolen from a museum in Grand Rapids, Minn. Without fingerprints or surveillance video, the authorities were stumped. At one point a private donor even offered a $1 million reward. The F.B.I. announced Tuesday that the stolen slippers had been found, but did not reveal any suspects in a case that captivated fans. As one put it: There isnt anything else that does more to evoke the power of belief. Have a great night. _____ Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p.m. Eastern. And dont miss Your Morning Briefing.

Heres the sign-up.) Good morning. Heres what you need to know:  The leak of previously secret documents on Thursday injected fresh intrigue into the confirmation hearings of President Trumps Supreme Court nominee, as Democrats pressed the judge to explain his comments on abortion rights and affirmative action. In one email from 2003, he appeared to challenge whether Roe v. Wade was the settled law of the land. On Thursday, Judge Kavanaugh said that the comment reflected an accurate description of all legal scholars. Republicans, who continue to support his appointment to the Supreme Court, discarded the revelations as insignificant. Heres an overview of Judge Kavanaughs record on civil rights, and a recap of what happened on Thursday. Our politics team will have coverage when the hearings resume at 9:30 a.m. Eastern.

One by one, top officials lined up on Thursday to say they had nothing to do with the unsigned essay in The Times that was sharply critical of President Trump. The White House started a furious mole hunt. The public played an obsessive guessing game. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, directed her Twitter followers to call the main switchboard of The Times to ask who wrote the piece.

With Roman Catholics clamoring for more transparency, attorneys general are aggressively investigating possible sexual abuse by clergy members. On Thursday alone, all eight Catholic dioceses in New York were issued subpoenas, and the New Jersey attorney general announced an inquiry. I was deeply troubled to read the allegations contained in last months Pennsylvania grand jury report, the attorney general said in a statement.

Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearings began, Senate Democrats eyeing a White House run in 2020 have used the live television event as a proving ground.",left,text,2018-09-06T15:39:16Z,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,"Advertisement Supported by By Sheryl Gay Stolberg WASHINGTON  The questioning of Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh had not even begun Thursday morning when Senator Cory Booker, Democrat of New Jersey, threatened to release secret emails  even if it meant being expelled from the Senate. This is about the closest Ill ever come in my life to an I am Spartacus moment, the senator declared with a flourish. It was a made-for-television moment  albeit later mocked by Republicans as grandstanding  and for Mr. Booker, it might come in handy. He is one of three Democrats on the Judiciary Committee  the others are Senators Kamala D. Harris of California and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota  said to be contemplating presidential runs in 2020, and there is no time like a stately, nationally televised Supreme Court nomination hearing to grab the attention of the news media and amass valuable footage for future campaign commercials. Other 2020 hopefuls, notably Senators Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, have been making their own moves this week. Ms. Gillibrand, who has positioned herself as a leading advocate for womens rights, has been appearing with womens groups to protest the nomination, calling it a clear threat to rights that women all across America hold dear. And Ms. Warren, notoriously press shy in the corridors of the Capitol, told Politico on Wednesday that she intended to open up and start giving hallway interviews. But for Ms. Harris and Mr. Booker  and to a lesser extent, Ms. Klobuchar, who is less given to high drama  the hearings have been something like a campaign audition, not to mention the criticism that goes along with it. Running for president is no excuse for violating the rules of the Senate or of confidentiality of the documents that we are privy to, Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, snapped after Mr. Booker made his threat about the emails. (It turned out that Mr. Booker had permission to make those messages public after all, prompting another Republican, Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina, to quip, You didnt have to be Spartacus.) It did not take long  just 13 words into the start of the first day of the hearings  for Ms. Harris to make her mark. The chairman of the Judiciary Committee had just gaveled hearings to order and was about to utter his 14th word when the California senator interrupted, demanding a delay to give the panel time to review a last-minute document dump. We cannot possibly move forward, she protested, as the chairman, Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, promptly ruled her out of order. Throughout the hearings, Ms. Harris, once the California attorney general, drew on her formidable skills as a former prosecutor to repeatedly skewer Judge Kavanaugh and back him into unpleasant corners. Can you think of any laws that give the government the power to make decisions about the male body? she asked at one point, in an exchange that picked up considerable traction on social media. The judge seemed flustered. Im not  Im not  thinking of any right now, senator, he replied. Mr. Booker, for his part, proved his skills at oratory; on Wednesday night, he talked for 23 of the 30 minutes he was allotted to question Judge Kavanaugh, delivering a soaring lecture on racial inequality  even as he repeatedly cut off the nominee while grilling him about his views on affirmative action, racial profiling and voter identification laws. It seems that you are O.K. with using race to single out some Americans for extra security measures because they look different, but youre not O.K. with using race to help promote diversity, Mr. Booker said at one point, while disclosing that the committee had a confidential email titled racial profiling relating to Judge Kavanaugh. For Mr. Booker and Ms. Harris, both darlings of the progressive movement, the hearings are also a chance to demonstrate fidelity to the left. Progressives have become increasingly frustrated with the way Senate Democrats are handling Judge Kavanaughs nomination; on Wednesday, more than a dozen groups sent a scathing letter to Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, accusing him of allowing moderate Democrats to go their own way in considering whether to vote for confirmation. Anything less than 49 Democratic votes against Kavanaugh would be a massive failure of your leadership, read the letter, organized by Credo Action, which bills itself as a social-change network. Republicans, on the other hand, are accusing the Democrats of playing politics with one of the most sacred duties of the Senate: the responsibility to advise and consent on a Supreme Court nomination. Mr. Booker came under withering criticism on Wednesday when he sent a letter to supporters asking for signatures opposing Judge Kavanaugh. The letter, which circulated on Twitter, asked recipients to click through to a website that offered tickets to a coming New Jersey Democratic State Committee event. Then, on Thursday, Ms. Harris sent out her own fund-raising email, spotlighting her does-the-government-have-the-power-to-regulate-the-male-body exchange with Judge Kavanaugh.

 The Latest: Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh has concluded his opening statement. The committee will resume his confirmation hearings at 9:30 a.m. Wednesday. Heres the latest.  Democrats turned the opening into a brawl, but Republicans pushed through. Opening statements in the hearing were delayed by more than an hour as Democratic senators complained about the limits on their access to documents from Judge Kavanaughs tenure in the Bush administration White House and pressed to adjourn. With protesters shouting and being removed from the room, Democrats sought a vote to postpone the hearing but were denied it. The frequent interruptions led one Republican, Senator John Cornyn of Texas, to call the opening of the hearing mob rule. But the committee chairman, Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, refused to delay the hearings opening day and got through it by about 5 p.m. [Democrats sought to portray Judge Kavanaugh as a hopeless partisan.]  Trumps potential legal troubles were a recurring theme. Many Democrats brought up statements by Judge Kavanaugh suggesting that he would be sympathetic to a sitting president who challenged a subpoena for testimony or an indictment. They suggested that President Trump may have picked him from the ranks of conservative jurists because he was hoping for an ally on the court, should Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel investigating the Trump campaigns ties to Russia, move against the president. Advertisement  Republicans praised Kavanaugh and expressed confidence he will be confirmed. Republicans used their opening statements to praise Judge Kavanaugh as highly qualified and a good man. They accused Democrats of hypocrisy and argued that his 12 years of appeals court rulings, which are public, are the best way to evaluate what kind of Supreme Court justice he would be. And, secure in the knowledge that they control the Senate and can confirmed the judge with a simple majority vote, Republicans expressed confidence that however unruly things get, the Senate will ultimately approve his appointment. Advertisement  The hearing foreshadowed likely Democratic frustration in coming days.  Democrats signaled in their opening statements that they intend to press Judge Kavanaugh to explain in detail what he thinks about contentious legal questions, especially whether the Roe v. Wade abortion rights decision was rightly decided  an issue that could illuminate whether he views it as settled precedent or vulnerable to overturning. But Republicans like Mr. Grassley said it would be inappropriate for him to indicate how he might rule on anything that might come before the court in the future. In his prepared opening statement, Judge Kavanaugh laid the groundwork for disclaiming that he will bring any ideological lens to interpreting ambiguous constitutional text, invoking the ideal of a judge as an umpire  a neutral and impartial arbiter who favors no litigant or policy. The hearing is scheduled to resume at 9:30 a.m. on Wednesday, starting with questioning by Mr. Grassley and by Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the ranking Democrat. Each senator on the committee will have 30 minutes in the first round of questioning and 20 in a second round, which is expected to wrap up on Thursday. Judge Kavanaugh would then be excused, and the senators will question a panel of legal experts who support and oppose his confirmation. Cant get enough? The rest of our dispatches from the day are below.  One of the biggest points of tension in the Kavanaugh confirmation hearings will be Judge Kavanaughs response to Democrats questions about whether he believes certain cases  notably Roe v. Wade, the 1973 landmark decision establishing a constitutional right to abortion  have been correctly decided. In his opening statement, Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the Judiciary Committee chairman, laid the groundwork for Judge Kavanaugh to refuse to answer, by invoking what has come to be known as the Ginsburg rule, after Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who was appointed by a Democratic president, Bill Clinton. [Read Judge Kavanaughs opening statement.] Declaring that it would be unfair and unethical for the judge to answer questions about specific cases, Mr. Grassley said: Its my advice to him to follow the example set by Judge Ginsburg, adding that a nominee should offer no hints, no forecasts, no views. Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the committees ranking Democrat, said a dissent from Judge Kavanaugh opened a window on his views on abortion, one she said indicated that he would not support the constitutional right to abortion established in 1973 in Roe v. Wade. Last year, Judge Kavanaugh said that allowing an undocumented teenager in federal custody to obtain an abortion was based on a constitutional principle as novel as it is wrong: a new right for unlawful immigrant minors in U.S. government detention to obtain immediate abortion on demand. He said he would have given the government more time to find a sponsor for the teenager. Advertisement But Judge Kavanaugh did not join a separate dissent from Judge Karen LeCraft Henderson, who wrote that the teenager had no right to an abortion because she was not a citizen and had entered the country unlawfully. Will a Supreme Court with two Trump-appointed justices overrule the right to an abortion? Its possible, but not the most likely outcome. Adam Liptak, The Timess Supreme Court reporter, explains. Ms. Feinstein is one of the most ardent supporters of gun restrictions in the Senate, and in her opening statement she forecast that she intended to grill Judge Kavanaugh about what she regarded as his out of the mainstream views on gun rights. Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh, President Trumps nominee to the Supreme Court, appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee for the first day of his confirmation hearing. She was referring to a dissent Judge Kavanaugh wrote in a case challenging a District of Columbia law that required gun owners to register their weapons, and banned possession of semiautomatic rifles. The appeals court upheld the limits as constitutionally permissible under the Second Amendment. But in his dissent, Judge Kavanaugh argued that a ban on semiautomatic rifles should be unconstitutional because they have not traditionally been banned and are in common use by law-abiding citizens for self-defense in the home, hunting and other lawful uses. For the senator, the issue of gun violence is personal. She became mayor of San Francisco more than 40 years ago when Mayor George Moscone and Harvey Milk, an openly gay politician, were shot and killed. In her opening statement, she noted that President Trump had promised that whomever he nominated to the Supreme Court would be anti-choice and pro-gun, adding, We believe what he said. Fred Guttenberg, the father of Jaime Guttenberg, a 14-year-old girl killed in the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Parkland, Florida, took to Twitter on Tuesday to say that Mr. Kavanaugh had rebuffed him when he went to introduce himself. 
            Just walked up to Judge Kavanaugh as morning session ended. Put out my hand to introduce myself as Jaime Guttenberg's dad. He pulled his hand back, turned his back to me and walked away. I guess he did not want to deal with the reality of gun violence.         In a video of the hearing, Mr. Guttenberg can be seen approaching the judge as the hearing was breaking for lunch and extending his hand to Judge Kavanaugh. Though it wasnt clear whether Judge Kavanaugh first saw him, the nominee did turn back and look at Mr. Guttenburg, who took a step closer and appeared to say something to him. Judge Kavanaugh then turned and walked away.

(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik) @ap pic.twitter.com/smcCGuLT6X  While Republicans cite Judge Kavanaughs impressive resume  Yale Law degree, Supreme Court clerkship  as a reason to confirm him, Democrats hope to turn the nominees biography against him by portraying him as a partisan hack. Advertisement Before joining the federal appeals court here, Judge Kavanaugh had a long history of Republican political activism. He worked on the team, led by Ken Starr, which investigated former President Bill Clinton. He was in Florida during the presidential recount of 2000, advising then-Gov. George W. Bush. (He also once represented Mr. Bushs brother Jeb.) Later, he joined the Bush White House. The judge has been involved of the most pitched and partisan battles of our lifetimes, Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware, said. Addressing Judge Kavanaugh directly, he added that it is critical that this committee and the American people fully examine your record to understand what kind of justice you would be. Senator Durbin, meanwhile, has called Judge Kavanaugh the Forrest Gump of Republican politics  a phrase he reprised on Tuesday, adding, You always show up in the picture. The hits kept coming: Judge Kavanaugh has been knee deep in partisan politics, Senator Mazie K. Hirono, Democrat of Hawaii, said. The first day of the confirmation hearings for Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh, President Trumps nominee to the Supreme Court, started with Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee pushing to adjourn and protesters being removed. Of course, President Trump also had to weigh in. 
            ....looking to inflict pain and embarrassment to one of the most highly renowned jurists to ever appear before Congress. So sad to see!         Senator Patrick Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, said that Judge Kavanaughs still-hidden White House records could be particularly illuminating on a question of pressing urgency: understanding his views on the scope of executive power  and, in particular, whether sitting presidents should be immune from legal process, like subpoenas to testify in a criminal investigation  while they are in office. Judge Kavanaugh came up in Washington conservative legal circles as a prosecutor working for Kenneth W. Starrs independent counsel investigation into President Bill Clinton. But later, in a speech he made at a law school after serving in President George W. Bushs White House and then becoming a judge, he said that the distraction of preparing for questions by criminal investigators would make a president do a worse job, so presidents should be excused from that burden until after they leave office. Advertisement His remarks were ambiguous: he said Congress should consider enacting a statute granting presidents temporary immunity while in office, which could suggest that the Constitution does not grant presidents that authority on its own. Still, he clearly indicated that he sympathizes with the idea that being subjected to legal process burdens a presidents ability to carry out his constitutional responsibilities. And the Supreme Court has never decided whether a president can be forced to testify in response to a subpoena  something that it may address if Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel investigating President Trumps campaign ties to Russia, were to subpoena him. Against that backdrop, Mr. Leahy said that Judge Kavanaughs expansive view of executive power and executive immunity may have intrigued Mr. Trump, while also noting that the president over the weekend attacked Attorney General Jeff Sessions for permitting the Justice Department to indict two Republican congressmen ahead of the midterm election. Youve taken the unorthodox position that presidents should not be burdened with a criminal or civil investigation while in office. Now we have a president who has declared in the last 24 hours that the Department of Justice shouldnt prosecute Republicans, Mr. Leahy said. Now, its  its Alice in Wonderland. And I find it difficult to imagine that your views on this subject escape the attention of President Trump, who seems increasingly fixated on his own ballooning legal jeopardy. Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, picked up that line of attack, focusing on what he said were convenient inconsistencies in Judge Kavanaughs views on whether sitting presidents can be questioned in criminal investigations. As a lawyer working for Mr. Starr, Judge Kavanaugh urged his superiors to question Mr. Clinton in graphic detail. After serving as Mr. Bushs staff secretary, though, Judge Kavanaughs views evolved. I believe that the president should be excused from some of the burdens of ordinary citizenship while serving in office, he wrote in 2009 in the Minnesota Law Review. Among those burdens, Judge Kavanaugh wrote, were responding to civil lawsuits and criminal charges. Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, can always be counted on to criticize Mr. Trump, and on Tuesday he did not disappoint. Mr. Flake began his opening statement by praising Judge Kavanaugh as a good family man and a fine athlete  the judge runs marathons. But then he pivoted to express serious concerns over how Judge Kavanaugh will deal with a president who does not seem to respect the institutions of government or the rule of law.  Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter. You must select a newsletter to subscribe to. View all New York Times newsletters. After reading aloud Mr. Trumps weekend tweet attacking Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Mr. Flake said, That is why a lot of people are concerned about this administration and why they want to ensure that our institutions hold. But while he pledged to question Judge Kavanaugh closely on his view of executive power, Mr. Flake is widely expected to be a yes vote when it comes to the judges confirmation. Advertisement Judge Kavanaughs nomination has been controversial at his alma mater, Yale Law School, Senator Ben Sasse, Republican of Nebraska, noted. Many hundreds of current and former law students there signed an open letter chastising the law schools administration for issuing a news release noting his nomination and gathering positive comments from faculty members. 
                President Trump is moving quickly to appoint federal judges. So far, his efforts have strengthened conservative majorities rather than changed the balance of most courts.             Judge Kavanaughs nomination, the letter said, presents an emergency  for democratic life, for our safety and freedom, for the future of our country. The law schools news release concerning Judge Kavanaugh was similar to earlier ones issued after other alumni were nominated to high positions, including Justice Sonia Sotomayor and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. A second open letter, also signed by hundreds of current and former students, wrote that Judge Kavanaugh has been a valuable friend to the Yale community and was eminently qualified to serve as a Supreme Court justice. The moment Judge Kavanaughs confirmation hearing opened, Democrats and protesters turned it into a verbal brawl. Senator Kamala Harris, Democrat of California, immediately interrupted the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Charles E. Grassley, demanding a delay to consider tens of thousands of pages of documents released Monday  the night before the hearing and a holiday. Other Democrats backed her, especially the senators considering a run for the White House in 2020, as did womens rights protesters, several of whom were arrested and thrown out as they decried the sessions as a sham. We cannot possibly move forward, Mr. Chairman, with this hearing, one of the presidential aspirants, Senator Harris, declared. Advertisement Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut called the hearing a charade and a mockery. What are we trying to hide? Why are we rushing? asked Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont. As the Democrats spoke, activists were dragged, shouting, one by one out of the hearing room. We dissent! Vote no! Vote no! one cried. [Read more about how the G.O.P. under Trump is carrying out a sweeping transformation of the federal judiciary.] Mr. Grassley argued that the committee has received more materials on Judge Kavanaugh than we have had on any Supreme Court nominee in history. He said Republican aides have already reviewed the 42,000 documents that arrived Monday night. Thats no reason to delay the hearing. Democrats quieted down  temporarily  and the hearing appeared to be getting underway with Judge Kavanaugh introducing his family  including his wife, his parents, an aunt and uncle and cousins. But as soon as he finished, Democrats renewed their request to delay the hearing. The fight over records concerning Judge Kavanaugh came as no surprise to Senate Republicans. Some of them, including Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader, feared in July  when President Trump was choosing among the finalists  that Judge Kavanaughs enormous paper trail could stall his nomination Confirmation hearings for Supreme Court nominees didnt always exist. But the 19th Amendment, school desegregation and television all contributed to major changes in the process. New York Times reporters Maggie Haberman and Jonathan Martin wrote at the time that Mr. McConnell made clear in multiple phone calls with Mr. Trump and the White House counsel, Donald F. McGahn II, that Judge Kavanaughs paper trail would pose difficulties for his confirmation. Advertisement Because the number of pages ran into the millions, Mr. McConnell said they could hand Senate Democrats an opportunity to delay the confirmation vote until after the new session of the Supreme Court began in October. Democrats focused intensely on the amount of information they say is being withheld from them about Judge Kavanaughs work in the White House under President George W. Bush. 
            Its unprecedented for the Senate Judiciary Committee to be considering a nominee for the highest court in the land without reviewing documents from 35 months of his public service in the White House. #WhatAreTheyHiding pic.twitter.com/eE7ThqLUZH  Thousands of pages of records have not yet been made public, and on Friday the Trump administration asserted executive privilege and refused to release more than 100,000 pages of records about Judge Kavanaughs time in the Bush White House. An additional 42,000 pages of documents were released the night before the hearing, according to Senator Chuck Schumer, the minority leader, who raised complaints about the timing. 
             The Senate was just given an additional 42,000 pages of Kavanaugh documents the NIGHT BEFORE his confirmation hearing. This underscores just how absurd this process is. Not a single senator will be able to review these records before tomorrow.         A press officer for the committee, responding via the committees Twitter account a few hours later, said the majority staff had completed its review of each and every one of these pages. About a dozen women, dressed in red robes and white bonnets in the fashion of The Handmaids Tale, stood silently, as if in prayer, outside the hearing room. In the atrium of the Hart Senate Office Building, just off the hearing room, over 250 activists from womens rights groups held a vigil in protest, sharing stories underscoring the importance of reproductive rights. They were joined by Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, the New York Democrat, who gave brief remarks, and gave a thunderous cheer when Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, joined them and took pictures with enthralled fans. Inside the chamber, protesters were arrested one by one, leaving once-coveted seats in the hearing room empty. 
            After the arrests at the Kavanaugh Hearing there are plenty of seats open in the hearing room: pic.twitter.com/LV0LC14HEf  The Womens March took credit for the protests, and said more than 30 women have been arrested so far. (So have a few men.) Advertisement Women are disrupting this hearing today because our lives are at risk, Rachel OLeary Carmona, chief operating officer of the Womens March, said in an emailed statement. Women will die if Kavanaugh is confirmed. One protester, referencing the withholding of records relating to Judge Kavanaugh, offered what was perhaps the days most unusual shout: I had to have a background check to work in a laundromat! For Democrats on the committee with possible presidential aspirations  including Senators Cory Booker of New Jersey, Harris and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota  the televised hearings offer an opportunity for combative questioning that can fuel both viral clips and material for a 2020 campaign. It is unclear how much Senator Feinstein will attempt to direct the questioning from members of her own party. As the Senates most ardent proponent of gun restrictions, she is expected to grill Judge Kavanaugh on a 2009 dissent in which he argued against banning semiautomatic weapons. Ms. Feinstein, who was the chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee when it conducted an investigation into the Bush administrations torture program after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, may also pursue her own line of questioning over Judge Kavanaughs time as an associate White House counsel  especially his offer to help a senior administration official prepare testimony about the governments surveillance of conversations between certain terrorism suspects and their lawyers. That offer, revealed in a trove of documents released ahead of the confirmation hearing, contradicts Judge Kavanaughs 2006 testimony, in which he told lawmakers he was not involved in the questions about the rules governing detention of combatants. Democrats have charged that the statement, made in a White House email, was a lie, although it is unknown if Judge Kavanaugh actually provided assistance.

But she wont be the last. By Michelle Goldberg Opinion Columnist Shortly after his inauguration, Donald Trump, uniquely attentive to his debt to the religious right, appointed the anti-abortion activist E. Scott Lloyd to head the Office of Refugee Resettlement, despite Lloyds lack of relevant experience. The position gave Lloyd authority over unaccompanied minors caught crossing into the United States, authority Lloyd exploited to try to stop pregnant migrants from getting abortions. Last year, thanks to Lloyds interference, a 17-year-old from Central America had to wage a legal battle to end her pregnancy. Known in court filings as Jane Doe, the girl learned she was pregnant while in custody in Texas, and was adamant that she wanted an abortion. In keeping with Texass parental consent law, she obtained a judges permission, helped by a legal organization called Janes Due Process. Janes Due Process raised money for the abortion, which was scheduled for the end of her first trimester. But under Lloyds direction, the shelter where she was being detained refused to cooperate. Doe went back to court, and a federal judge ruled in her favor, issuing a temporary restraining order against the government. The administration appealed, and the case, Garza v. Hargan, went to a three-judge panel of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. One of the judges was Brett Kavanaugh. Garza v. Hargan was the only major abortion-rights case Kavanaugh ever ruled on. His handling of it offers a clue about whats in store for American women if hes confirmed to the Supreme Court. No one knows whether Kavanaugh would vote to overturn Roe v. Wade outright or simply gut it. But even on a lower court, Kavanaugh put arbitrary obstacles in the way of someone desperate to end her pregnancy. Thanks to Trump, he may soon be in a position to do the same to millions of others. Its fitting that last weeks Kavanaugh confirmation hearings were regularly interrupted by the sound of women screaming. Again and again, protesters, most of them female, cried out for the preservation of their rights, and were arrested. Republican men were contemptuous. Whats the hysteria coming from? asked Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska. Let me answer. It is true, as Sasse said, that protesters have claimed for many years that if Roe v. Wade is overturned, women will die. Its a fair prediction; women died before Roe, and where abortion is illegal, unsafe abortion leads to maternal death. In the past, however, Roe has been saved. Should Kavanaugh be confirmed, it will either fall or be eviscerated.  In Garza, Kavanaugh and another judge vacated the temporary restraining order that prevented the government from hindering Does abortion. Brigitte Amiri, an A.C.L.U. lawyer who represented the girl, was stunned, because it seemed clear that Doe, whod already obtained the necessary judicial signoff, had the law on her side. It wasnt what I was expecting from any judge that would have read Roe v. Wade, Amiri said of the ruling. Conservatives, progressives, anyone. Indeed, a few days later, the full court reversed the panels decision. Kavanaugh, dissenting, wrote that the government has permissible interests in favoring fetal life. By the time Jane Doe got her abortion, she was 15 weeks pregnant and needed a more complicated second-trimester procedure. On Friday, Rochelle Garza, a lawyer who served as Does temporary legal guardian during the proceedings, testified at Kavanaughs confirmation hearings. She was one of the most vulnerable people in our community, Garza said of the girl, adding, She was an immigrant, she didnt speak English, she was in detention, and she was being put under extreme pressure. And I felt it was unfortunate that Judge Kavanaugh did not take that into consideration. We shouldnt expect a Trump nominee, however personally decent his friends say he is, to care about womens wishes. Kavanaughs defenders insist that hes the sort of judge any Republican would appoint, and they are correct. Still, its a particularly bitter insult that women stand to lose reproductive autonomy thanks to the minority presidential victory of a louche misogynist.  Politicians sometimes say that they are personally opposed to abortion, but believe it should be legal. Trump and some of his enablers reverse that formulation. The president, who does not, according to two of his lovers, wear condoms, has declined to say whether hes ever been involved with an abortion. According to court papers unsealed on Friday, Elliott Broidy, former deputy finance chairman of the Republican National Committee, also refused to wear condoms during sex with his mistress, Shera Bechard, then demanded she get an abortion when she became pregnant. According to the unsealed papers, Broidy admired Trumps uncanny ability to sexually abuse woman and get away with it. A famous pro-choice poster from the 1980s proclaimed, Your body is a battleground. Kavanaugh is likely to join the Supreme Court because in 2016, the woman whom most women voted for was defeated. Now our bodies are subject to occupation. Michelle Goldberg has been an Opinion columnist since 2017.

Heres the sign-up.) Good morning. Heres what you need to know:  Its the question almost everyone in Washington (and beyond) wants answered. President Trump erupted in anger on Wednesday after The Times published a stinging Opinion piece by an unidentified senior official saying that a quiet resistance in the administration was working to thwart the presidents worst inclinations. The article, which said the presidents problems were rooted in amorality, raised questions about his capacity to govern. Read the Op-Ed here. Mr. Trump denounced the essay, calling it gutless, and the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, issued a statement about its author saying, This coward should do the right thing and resign. Washington has been scrambling to identify the anonymous official. This morning, Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo denied writing the piece.  The Opinion pages of The Times are managed separately from the newsroom. The Op-Ed editor, James Dao, said the material was important enough to merit anonymity, which the department rarely grants.  As a White House lawyer in the George W. Bush administration, Judge Brett Kavanaugh raised doubts about whether Roe v. Wade, the landmark Supreme Court ruling that found a constitutional right to an abortion, was settled law, according to an email made available to The Times. He also called an affirmative action regulation a naked racial set-aside. The email, written in March 2003, is one of thousands of documents that were turned over to the Senate Judiciary Committee before confirmation hearings for Judge Kavanaugh, President Trumps Supreme Court nominee, but that were not made public or available for discussion by Democrats. The document was among several provided to The Times late Wednesday. The news is likely to take center stage today, the third day of Judge Kavanaughs confirmation hearings.

Grassley swearing in the Supreme Court nominee Brett M. Kavanaugh during his confirmation hearing on Tuesday before the Senate Judiciary Committee.,right,text,2018-09-05T00:47:00Z,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,"Advertisement Supported by By Sheryl Gay Stolberg and Adam Liptak WASHINGTON  Senate Democrats tore into President Trumps Supreme Court nominee on Tuesday, painting Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh as a narrow-minded partisan as the opening day of his confirmation hearings verged on pandemonium. Dozens of screaming protesters were hauled out of the hearing room in handcuffs. The verbal brawl began moments after the hearings began. Democrats, furious at being denied access to records related to Judge Kavanaugh, immediately interrupted the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, demanding time to consider tens of thousands of pages of documents released late Monday  the night before the hearing. Judge Kavanaugh, who finally had the microphone hours later, portrayed himself as an impartial jurist and affable family man. I am not a pro-plaintiff or pro-defendant judge, Judge Kavanaugh told the committee. Im not a pro-prosecution or pro-defense judge. I am a pro-law judge. But the hearings were dominated by Democratic theatrics and crackling protests. For more than an hour at the outset, irate Democrats and a frustrated Mr. Grassley parried back and forth. Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, denounced the hearing as a charade and a mockery and repeatedly moved to adjourn, while Mr. Grassley ruled him out of order over and over again. At one point, Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, accused Democrats of engaging in mob rule. Protesters, most of them women, shouted down senators; by days end, Capitol Police said a total of 70 people had been arrested, including nine outside the room. It was a chaotic start to what would ordinarily be a staid, albeit deeply consequential, process. And barring an astounding revelation, the path remains clear for Judge Kavanaughs ultimate confirmation  probably this month. If he is confirmed, he could shape American jurisprudence for decades to come, replacing the retired Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, a critical swing vote on divisive matters like same-sex marriage and abortion, with an unabashed conservative. The session, which mostly settled down by the afternoon, also gave Americans their first extended glimpse of Judge Kavanaugh, 53, who brought his family  his wife and two daughters, his parents, an aunt and uncle and some cousins  along with him. He talked about going to ball games with his father and coaching his daughter in basketball, drawing bipartisan smiles when he gave a shoutout to each member of the team. But that was about the extent of the comity; just days after members of the Senate had gathered together in a bipartisan show of civility at the funeral of Senator John McCain, the crowded hearing room in the Hart Senate Office Building seethed with antipathy. Some of it reflected lingering bitterness over the treatment of Judge Merrick B. Garland, whose nomination to the Supreme Court in 2016 by President Barack Obama was not even considered by Senate Republicans. In his opening statement, Judge Kavanaugh made a point of praising his colleagues on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit  and one in particular. I have served with 17 other judges, each of them a colleague and a friend, on a court now led by our superb chief judge, Merrick Garland, Judge Kavanaugh said While Republicans cited Judge Kavanaughs impressive rsum  Yale Law degree, Supreme Court clerkship  as a reason to confirm him, Democrats made clear that they are laying the groundwork to turn the nominees biography against him. Before joining the federal appeals court, Judge Kavanaugh had a long history of Republican political activism. He worked on the team, led by Ken Starr, that investigated former President Bill Clinton. He was in Florida during the presidential recount of 2000, advising George W. Bush, the governor at the time. (He also once represented Mr. Bushs brother Jeb.) Later, he joined the Bush White House. Judge Kavanaugh has been knee deep in partisan politics, said Senator Mazie K. Hirono, Democrat of Hawaii. Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware, said the nominee had been involved in some of of the most pitched and partisan battles of our lifetimes. Addressing Judge Kavanaugh directly, Mr. Coons added that it was critical that this committee and the American people fully examine your record to understand what kind of justice you would be. Democrats have been complaining for weeks that the document production process, supervised by a lawyer for former President Bush, is rigged. Only a portion of documents relating to Judge Kavanaughs time in the White House Counsels Office have been made available to the committee  and many of those are being kept from the public. And the committee has received no documents from Judge Kavanaughs time as staff secretary to Mr. Bush, a role that he has said was the most interesting and informative for me, as preparations for his work as a judge. Republicans countered that Democrats were harping on access to documents because they could not quibble with Judge Kavanaughs qualifications. And they took digs at their Democratic colleagues on the judiciary panel, several of whom  Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Cory Booker of New Jersey and Kamala D. Harris of California  are weighing presidential runs. This is not about documents, said Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas. Its not about qualification. Its not about record. What it is about is politics. It is about Democratic senators trying to re-litigate the 2016 election, and, just as importantly, working to begin litigating the 2020 presidential election. Senator Patrick Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, said that Judge Kavanaughs still-hidden White House records could be particularly illuminating on a question of pressing urgency: understanding his views on the scope of executive power  in particular, whether sitting presidents should be immune from the legal process, like subpoenas to testify in a criminal investigation. As a lawyer working for Mr. Starr, Judge Kavanaugh urged his superiors to question Mr. Clinton in graphic detail. But his views on the topic have evolved considerably since then. In a speech he made at a law school after serving in the Bush White House and then becoming a judge, he said that the distraction of preparing for questions by criminal investigators would make a president do a worse job, so presidents should be excused from that burden until after they leave office. Democrats insinuated that Mr. Trump nominated Judge Kavanaugh because he believed the judge would protect him from the investigation being conducted by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel. Youve taken the unorthodox position that presidents should not be burdened with a criminal or civil investigation while in office, Mr. Leahy said. Now we have a president who has declared in the last 24 hours that the Department of Justice shouldnt prosecute Republicans, Mr. Leahy said. Now, its  its Alice in Wonderland. And I find it difficult to imagine that your views on this subject escape the attention of President Trump, who seems increasingly fixated on his own ballooning legal jeopardy. Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, picked up that line of attack, focusing on what he said were convenient inconsistencies in Judge Kavanaughs views on whether sitting presidents could be questioned in criminal investigations. This is a president whos shown us consistently that hes contemptuous of the rule of law, Mr. Durbin said. Its that president whos decided you are his man. So are people nervous about this? Mr. Durbin continued. Are they concerned about it? Of course they are. Many of those who are nervous were seated in the audience, including Linda Sarsour, a founder of the Womens March, who was one of the first in line to attend the hearing  and one of the first to be arrested. Also in the room was Fred Guttenberg, the father of Jaime Guttenberg, a 14-year-old girl killed in the school shooting in Parkland, Fla., who created a buzz on Twitter after Judge Kavanaugh appeared to rebuff his effort to shake the nominees hand. Tuesdays hearings consisted of only opening statements. When questioning begins on Wednesday, Judge Kavanaugh is sure to face a detailed examination of his views on abortion. Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, expressed concern that Judge Kavanaugh would vote to overturn Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that established a constitutional right to abortion. She cited a dissent last year in which Judge Kavanaugh said he would have delayed an abortion sought by an undocumented teenager in government custody. Judge Kavanaugh said that allowing an undocumented teenager in federal custody to obtain an abortion was based on a constitutional principle as novel as it is wrong: a new right for unlawful immigrant minors in U.S. government detention to obtain immediate abortion on demand. He said he would have given the government more time to find a sponsor for the teenager. In his opening statement, Judge Kavanaugh said he would model himself on Justice Kennedy, for whom he once served as a law clerk. In the process, Judge Kavanaugh sought to assure the committee that he would be a neutral and impartial arbiter who favors no litigant or policy. As Justice Kennedy showed us, a judge must be independent, not swayed by public pressure, Judge Kavanaugh said. Our independent judiciary is the crown jewel of our constitutional republic. In our independent judiciary, the Supreme Court is the last line of defense for the separation of powers, and the rights and liberties guaranteed by the Constitution. An earlier version of this article misstated the proportion of documents from Judge Brett Kavanaughs time in the White House Counsels Office that have been made available to the Senate Judiciary Committee. The committee was given 445,000 of 663,000 total documents, which is a portion but not a small portion of the total. Charlie Savage and Catie Edmondson contributed reporting.

Its shocking but no longer surprising. By David Leonhardt Opinion Columnist First, the revelations about the Trump White House in Bob Woodwards forthcoming book are shocking. Many White House officials do not respect the president, and theyre quite happy to leak damaging anecdotes about him. For anyone who spent time in Washington during the Bush and Obama years  when both presidents were largely revered by their staffs  its a jarring change.  But it is no longer surprising. Its been abundantly clear for a long time that President Trump is unfit for the office  and that the people who work for him somehow manage both to disdain him and to continue protecting him at the expense of the country. For more, read The Washington Posts summary of the book and Jonathan Chaits commentary about it for New York magazine.  The Supreme Court. The raucous opening day of Judge Brett Kavanaughs confirmation hearing wasnt, for the most part, about him. It was about the Republican Partys hardball, rule-changing tactics in transforming the federal courts.  Democrats are driving home that Republicans keep changing the rules, Voxs Tara Golshan wrote. In particular, Democrats yesterday were blasting the last-minute release  without time for scrutiny  of tens of thousands of documents related to Kavanaughs time as a White House aide during George W. Bushs presidency.  This is not the debate Republicans wanted to have, James Wallner, a former Republican Senate staff member, tweeted yesterday morning. Note: Kavanaugh hasnt been debated once. Its just the process, the documents. Democrats have framed this debate 100%. A little history is useful here. Both parties, without question, have played a role in making the courts more partisan and overtly political. As Republicans like to emphasize, the Democrats were the ones who first rejected a nominee based strictly on ideology: Robert Bork, in 1987. In Borks place, President Ronald Reagan ultimately nominated the more moderate Anthony Kennedy, whose retirement in turn led to Kavanaughs nomination. But its also the case that Republicans have done much more than Democrats to politicize the courts. How so? One, they have rejected a significantly higher percentage of Democratic nominees since 1981 than Democrats have rejected Republican nominees, according to data collected by the legal scholar Russell Wheeler. This high rejection rate eventually led Senate Democrats during the Obama years to eliminate the filibuster for federal appeals court judges. (That move has recently received criticism, because Republicans later did the same for Supreme Court nominees, but I still think Democrats had no better alternative, given Republican obstruction.) Two, Republicans have nominated more politically extreme judges than Democrats have, as research by Lee Epstein of Washington University and others has shown. Jason Zengerles recent Times Magazine piece and the accompanying episode of The Daily podcast have more details. Three, Republicans stole a Supreme Court seat by refusing to let President Barack Obama fill a vacancy in 2016. There was no precedent for such a move, and it was vastly more radical than anything Democrats have done. The seat effectively decided many of the courts biggest cases last year, and it will shape the court for decades. As Ive written before, I expect the Senate to confirm Kavanaugh. Republicans have the votes to do so, and theyve shown no signs of splintering. If Im right about that, this weeks hearings are more about framing the debate over the future of the courts than anything else.  And Democrats are absolutely right to use the occasion to explain how radical Senate Republicans  and, by extension, large parts of the federal judiciary  have become.  Finally, Congressional districts change over the years. But the closest thing to todays Seventh Congressional District in Massachusetts was previously represented by John F. Kennedy, Tip ONeill and Joe Kennedy II.  Starting in January, it will almost certainly be represented by Ayanna Pressley, who beat the incumbent handily in the Democratic primary last night. She would be the first African-American ever to represent Massachusetts in the House.  You can join me on Twitter (@DLeonhardt) and Facebook. You can subscribe to this newsletter here.

Kavanaugh.,left,text,2018-09-07T23:48:59Z,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,"Advertisement Supported by By Charlie Savage and Sheryl Gay Stolberg WASHINGTON  Senate Democrats and their allies accused Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh on Friday of misleading the Judiciary Committee, saying he dissembled in testimony about crucial issues ranging from his views on abortion rights to his involvement in several Bush-era controversies. But Republicans expressed confidence that none of the punches Democrats had thrown at the Supreme Court nominee had landed with sufficient force to jeopardize his confirmation. Four days of Supreme Court confirmation hearings ended on Friday the way they began, with sharply partisan charges and tension remarkable for normally staid proceedings. In two of the strongest statements on Friday, Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the top Democrat on the committee, said on Twitter that Judge Kavanaugh gave answers that were not true when asked whether he had used materials stolen from committee Democrats when he was a White House lawyer under President George W. Bush. Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, also using Twitter, accused the judge of lying. What else is he lying about? Mr. Wyden wrote. His views on overturning #RoevWade? Whether he was involved in Bush-era torture programs? Whether he believes Trump can pardon himself? Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, raised the volume on Saturday morning. But Raj Shah, a White House spokesman, dismissed the complaints by Democrats and liberals, while attacking those who made public some of Judge Kavanaughs White House emails that were provided to the Judiciary Committee but marked confidential, meaning they were not to be disclosed. We should put these Democratic senators under oath, because they are the ones deliberately misleading the public, Mr. Shah said. Theyve violated Senate rules, leaked confidential information and trafficked in conspiracy theories  all in a desperate attempt to smear Judge Kavanaughs stellar reputation. The good news for the country is that it has been a resounding failure. Mr. Shahs final point may prove true. Senate Democratic staff members, preparing for the next phase of the fight, circulated a draft document on Friday titled Judge Kavanaugh Misled the Judiciary in 2004 and 2006 and Has Done So Once Again. But with no Republican senator signaling any concern, and with the party holding 51 votes in the Senate, Judge Kavanaughs confirmation appeared likely, even as questions linger over documents that remain hidden from the public. I expect that over the next months, even years, all of the relevant documents will eventually become public and we may well end up having a much clearer record in a number of the incidents that were debated very fiercely, said Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware. And at that point, he added, Judge Kavanaugh will most likely be serving as a justice of the Supreme Court. Here are some of the issues that arose during the hearing, and how Judge Kavanaugh addressed them: Mr. Leahy pushed Judge Kavanaugh on his testimony, during his 2004 and 2006 appeals court confirmation hearings, that he neither knew nor suspected that a Republican Senate aide with whom he had interacted, Manuel Miranda, had infiltrated the computer files of Judiciary Committee Democrats about which of Mr. Bushs appeals court nominees Democrats would try to block and with what tactics. Mr. Leahy cited numerous emails that Mr. Miranda had sent Judge Kavanaugh and a few other officials during that period, including verbatim internal Democratic talking points, a draft Democratic letter that was not yet public, intel about what questions Mr. Leahy was planning to ask a nominee at a coming hearing, and an email chain about meeting at Mr. Mirandas apartment to obtain useful info about two other Democratic senators. But Judge Kavanaugh testified that none of the information he received had raised a red flag, suggesting that he had assumed the Republican Senate aides were instead receiving information from friends on the Democratic staff. Separately, Mr. Miranda told The New York Times that he never informed Judge Kavanaugh about the computer server. I am not satisfied with the answers, certainly on the stolen Manny Miranda material, Mr. Leahy said on Friday. I think its fair to say that he was not forthright with me and Im bothered by it. A Democratic lawyer who saw some of her work copied by Mr. Miranda concluded on Slate.com on Friday that Judge Kavanaugh not only should not be confirmed but also should perhaps be impeached. As an appeals court nominee, Judge Kavanaugh distanced himself from significant involvement with two other Bush appeals court nominees who attracted controversy, Charles W. Pickering Sr. and William H. Pryor Jr. While he acknowledged in writing that he had participated in discussions and meetings concerning all of the presidents judicial nominations as a member of a judicial selection committee, he told senators that Judge Pryor was not one that I worked on personally and Judge Pickering was not one of the judicial nominees that I was primarily handling. Still, emails showed he did do some work on both nominations. Among other things, Judge Kavanaugh was invited to participate in a conference call about Judge Pryors pending confirmation hearing in an email that went to a Pryor Working Group, and he performed a variety of tasks on the Pickering nomination, like meeting with Senate aides about him and handling a draft opinion article that supported Mr. Pickering. A colleague identified him as one of two White House lawyers who had been much more involved in the Pickering fight. In August, after Democrats suggested that Judge Kavanaugh had misled the Senate about his involvement in the Pickering nomination, his defenders said he was not the White House official assigned to primarily handle that one. Asked at the hearing about the Pryor nomination, Mr. Kavanaugh gave a similar answer. Judge Kavanaugh also faced scrutiny from Mr. Leahy over his statement to Mr. Leahy in his 2006 confirmation hearing that he had first learned about the Bush administrations warrantless surveillance program from a December 2005 news article. Mr. Leahy had been asking what he had seen in his role as staff secretary from 2003 to 2006. Yet a Sept. 17, 2001, email showed that Judge Kavanaugh  then a White House lawyer, not staff secretary  asked John Yoo, a Justice Department lawyer, whether there were any results yet on the Fourth Amendment implications of warrantless surveillance for counterterrorism purposes. Later that day, Mr. Yoo completed a memo on a hypothetical warrantless wiretapping program that evolved into a more extensive memo that Mr. Yoo signed on Oct. 4, 2001, the day the program secretly started. Insisting that his testimony had been 100 percent accurate, Judge Kavanaugh said that in the early days after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, White House lawyers worked on many things related to national security, but he had never been read into the existence of the surveillance program. Mr. Yoo corroborated that account. Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, grilled Judge Kavanaugh about his testimony over his involvement in Bush administration policy for the handling of captured terrorism suspects. As an appeals court nominee, Judge Kavanaugh turned aside questions about torture by saying that he was not involved in the questions about the rules governing detention of combatants and portrayed his portfolio as focusing on civil justice issues like terrorism insurance. It later emerged that when the Bush administration was internally debating whether American citizens being held as enemy combatants should have access to lawyers, Judge Kavanaugh had advised that the Supreme Court justice Anthony M. Kennedy would probably rule that they had a right to them. An email also showed that in September 2001, he volunteered to prepare a senior Bush administration official to testify about the governments monitoring of conversations between federal terrorism inmates and their lawyers. But Judge Kavanaugh said that my testimony then was accurate and was the truth. He said he had understood Mr. Durbins question in 2006 to be about the Bush administrations enhanced interrogation program, which he was not involved in. As for the signing statement about the torture ban, he said his role as staff secretary was to hand papers to the president that had been prepared by others. On Wednesday, Judge Kavanaugh told Ms. Feinstein that he considered the 1972 abortion rights ruling, Roe v. Wade, to be a settled as a precedent of the Supreme Court entitled the respect under principles of a legal doctrine that justices should not lightly reopen already decided issues. But a 2003 White House email by Judge Kavanaugh  which emerged into public view on Thursday morning  showed that he had objected to a line in a draft opinion article stating that it is widely accepted by legal scholars across the board that Roe v. Wade and its progeny are the settled law of the land. He proposed deleting that line, writing: I am not sure that all legal scholars refer to Roe as the settled law of the land at the Supreme Court level since court can always overrule its precedent, and three current justices on the court would do so. Although his email stopped short of saying what he personally believed, Democrats and abortion rights advocates portrayed that as a contradiction that suggested he was being evasive and did not believe Roe was settled. But Judge Kavanaugh told Ms. Feinstein on Thursday that he had only meant that the line inaccurately overstated the position of legal scholars and reiterated that Roe was a precedent that had been reaffirmed repeatedly.

Oliver (Want to get this briefing by email? Heres the sign-up.) Good evening. Heres the latest. 1. President Trump called on the Justice Department to investigate who wrote an anonymous Op-Ed in The New York Times assailing his administration. I would say Jeff should be investigating who the author of that piece was because I really believe its national security, he said on Air Force One, referring to Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Separately, George Papadopoulos, a former Trump campaign adviser who last year pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I., was sentenced to 14 days in jail. _____ 2. Despite President Trumps rage, this week illustrated why almost all elected Republicans have quietly supported him through his travails  or at least not chastised him too loudly. As the confirmation hearings for Judge Brett Kavanaugh came to a close, Senate Republicans pressed steadily through angry liberal protests and sharp questions fromDemocrats. It may deliver one of the Trump administrations most enduring legacies: an ideological shift in the Supreme Court that will last for decades. Above, Senator Charles Grassley, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. For an idea of what abortion rights may look like if Judge Kavanaugh joins the Supreme Court, our reporter writes, just look to Arkansas. _____ 3. The U.S. added 201,000 jobs last month, slightly topping analysts expectations. The unemployment rate stayed at 3.9 percent, but a 0.4 percent monthly increase in average hourly earnings relieved some of the anxiety about sluggish wages. President Trump escalated the trade dispute with China, threatening to tax virtually all Chinese imports. But so far, political intrigue and anxieties over a trade war have done little to dent a 95-month streak of job creation. _____ 4. More turbulence at Tesla. Shares dropped sharply after news that its accounting chief had departed just weeks after joining the company. The departure is the latest in a string of nearly a dozen top executives who have left Tesla this year. Hours earlier, Teslas chief executive, Elon Musk, appeared live on YouTube in an interview with the comedian Joe Rogan and seemed to be smoking marijuana. Mr. Musks stability and managerial fitness have come under scrutiny after he unexpectedly tweeted he planned to take the company private, then reversed course. _____ 5. Alex Jones is facing a reckoning. After news that Twitter had permanently banned his personal account and that of Infowars, his company, the big question is whether his hallmark bluster can see him out of his current peril. With tech giants  including Facebook, Pinterest, YouTube and Apple  cracking down on him, Mr. Joness ability to reach his audience has been cut off. But hes as much marketer as ideological warrior, selling products to assuage the fears he is so expert at stoking. And true to form, hes been using the challenge to move more product. _____ 6. The E.P.A. is reviewing a major law that restricts mercury emissions by coal-burning power plants. The rule, based on decades of research showing that mercury damages the brain, lungs and fetal health, is among the agencys costliest but most effective clean-air policies. The re-evaluation fits into a far-reaching administration strategy to loosen environmental rules affecting countless other industries for years to come by adjusting the factors used to judge the benefits to human health that the rule has brought. _____ 7. The latest from the U.S. Open: Rafael Nadal, the No. 1 seed and defending champion, struggled with a sore knee and ended up retiring from his semifinal against No. 3 Juan Martn del Potro. Novak Djokovic and 21st-seeded Kei Nishikori are vying for the chance to face Del Potro Sunday afternoon. He will be playing his first Grand Slam final since beating Roger Federer to win the U.S. Open in 2009. And Serena Williams will play Naomi Osaka on Saturday. Ms. Williams will be trying to tie Margaret Courts record of 24 major singles titles, while Ms. Osaka will be aiming to duplicate a win this spring over Ms. Williams and claim her first Grand Slam title. Check back for updates and results. _____ 8. Voters in Sweden  head to the polls on Sunday, and immigration and crime have taken center stage. The far right is expected to take one-fifth of the vote, and some Swedes worry that one such party is becoming normalized.

Heres what you need to know: Ayanna Pressley upset the 10-term Representative Michael Capuano in a Massachusetts primary on Tuesday, becoming the latest Democratic underdog to ride a restless political climate to victory. Much like the win of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in New York, Ms. Pressleys success delivered a message to the Democratic establishment that progressive newcomers, especially women and minorities, were unwilling to wait their turn. Her campaign slogan: Change cant wait. No Republican is on the November ballot to oppose Ms. Pressley, who would be the states first African-American woman in Congress.  In Chicago, Mayor Rahm Emanuel announced that he would not seek re-election after nearly eight years in office. No clear front-runner has emerged to replace him.

Abortion, gun rights and the scope of executive power are likely to come up  and our Politics section will have updates from 7 a.m. Eastern. The first day of the confirmation process for the Supreme Court, normally a contentious but decorous affair, verged on pandemonium on Tuesday. Here are the takeaways. Democrats repeatedly interrupted the Senate Judiciary Committee chairman, Charles Grassley of Iowa, demanding time to review documents released the night before. Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, denounced the hearing as a charade and a mockery. Dozens of protesters were led out in handcuffs.  Judge Kavanaugh described himself as impartial and pro-law. Democrats portrayed him as a narrow-minded conservative partisan. Executives from Facebook and Twitter will testify today about their response to foreign interference in elections and their moderation practices. Theyre expected to take a conciliatory approach, but it remains to be seen how theyll respond to accusations of bias. Heres what to watch for. While the companies have tried to crack down on hate speech, they acknowledge they have been slow to act. Some content that violates Facebook rules thrives in private groups.  Can you identify posts designed to fool you? Take our quiz. Fear, by the veteran journalist Bob Woodward, is the latest book to describe top officials working to undermine President Trumps impulses and privately insulting him. The anecdotes, gathered by nameless interviews with current and former officials, include Defense Secretary Jim Mattis comparing Mr. Trump to a fifth or sixth grader, and Gary Cohn, then the chief economic adviser, removing an important letter from the Oval Office desk so the president would forget to sign it. (According to the book, he did forget.) Mr. Trump accused Mr. Woodward of making up quotes and of running a con on the public.  Here are the books key takeaways and our review. Hiring the former N.F.L. quarterback who led player protests for an ad campaign is in line with decades of practice by a company that rarely shies away from politics.

One hundred years ago, the world was in the throes of World War I. The war weighed heavily on America, even on one of its favorite pastimes: baseball. A work or fight order for men in nonessential jobs was issued in July 1918, and the baseball season was cut short. On this day that year, the World Series began in Chicago. It was the earliest calendar date in the history of the series. And the game, between the Boston Red Sox and Chicago Cubs, provided another first. As the small crowd stood for the seventh-inning stretch, the military band began to play The Star-Spangled Banner. Red Sox third baseman Fred Thomas, playing while on furlough from the Navy, stood at attention with a military salute. First the song was taken up by a few, then others joined, and when the final notes came, a great volume of melody rolled across the field, said a spirited Times report. The song was an outburst of patriotism which caused every mothers son in the stands to forget all about baseball. It was the first time the anthem was sung at a major American sporting event. The song was played for the rest of the series, and for many more games to come. Remy Tumin wrote todays Back Story. _____ Your Morning Briefing is published weekdays and updated all morning.

Heres the sign-up.) Good morning. Heres what you need to know: Judge Brett Kavanaughs nomination has come to symbolize Republicans yearning to shape the future of the federal judiciary. His confirmation hearings begin today, and you can keep up with developments here. A conservative stalwart who would replace the courts swing vote, Judge Kavanaugh, 53, would probably tilt the court to the right. We look at his likely role as a justice, and  where he stands on major issues.  Opponents will probably present the judge as a far-right extremist who would roll back abortion rights and protect President Trump from the threat of subpoena. Democrats have already protested the White Houses decision to withhold 100,000 pages of documents related to his work in the George W. Bush administration. Two easy wins now in doubt because there is not enough time. Good job Jeff. That was President Trumps latest salvo against his attorney general, criticizing the Justice Departments decision to bring criminal charges against two Republican congressmen before the midterm elections. In tying law enforcement decisions to Republicans chances to keep control of the House, Mr. Trump drew rebukes from former prosecutors and members of his own party.  Separately, we look at how the Justice Department has redefined decades of civil rights enforcement to focus on protecting people of faith, police officers and local government officials. The magazine decided to withdraw an invitation to President Trumps former chief strategist to speak at this years New Yorker Festival after several others said they would drop out in protest. I will not take part in an event that normalizes hate, the filmmaker Judd Apatow said. David Remnick, the magazines editor, initially defended Mr. Bannons participation, but he reconsidered after the withdrawals and a furor on social media.  Mr. Bannon called Mr. Remnick gutless. A looming assault on Idlib Province could deliver a decisive military blow against rebel fighters, prompting Western leaders to warn of an impending humanitarian calamity. Attacking the whole of Idlib to eliminate some radical groups would mean causing the death of hundreds of thousands of people and making 3.5 million people leave their homes one more time, Mevlut Cavusoglu, Turkeys foreign minister, said.  About 30,000 rebels are believed to be in the area, along with millions of noncombatants. A year after the storm, progress in Texas is unevenly distributed, leaving many minority and low-income residents struggling. Our Houston bureau chief and a photographer look at those left behind. A recent survey showed that 27 percent of Hispanic Texans whose homes were badly damaged reported that those homes remained unsafe to live in, compared with 20 percent of blacks and 11 percent of whites.

But in a broad reordering of the $3.5 trillion retail industry, the companies that learned how to match the instant gratification of e-commerce are capturing more gains.

The chairman of NBC News defended the networks handling of Ronan Farrows reporting on Harvey Weinstein last year, saying the work was not fit for broadcast. Mr. Farrow and one of his sources pushed back.  The U.S.  is making it harder to hire foreigners by denying visas, asking for more information and delaying approvals, say corporate leaders who complain that harsher policies are inhibiting business.

As the country mourns the loss of Senator John McCain, theres a story from his past worth mentioning. A sensationalist Russian tabloid published a report in 2008 that purported to explain Mr. McCains antipathy to Russia. A government-funded Russian newspaper helped disseminate the story, in which Yuri Truschechkin, a former Soviet lieutenant colonel, said he had shot down Mr. McCains plane in North Vietnam in 1967. Mr. McCain spent more than five years as a prisoner of war. Mr. Truschechkin came forward, according to the report, after recognizing Mr. McCain during coverage of his presidential campaign. He always hated the Russians, Mr. Truschechkin said. He knew that it was our rocket that downed his plane. (Watch the video coverage.) Mr. Truschechkin, 70, had led a less than illustrious life, and was surviving on a pension of just over $450 a month. The story prompted some Russians to call for him to be honored. Just two months later, Russian newspapers reported that Mr. Truschechkin had died of cancer. He was said to have had just one question for Mr. McCain: whether he had finished reading the works of Karl Marx.

Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.,right,text,2018-09-04T20:54:29Z,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,"Advertisement Supported by On Washington By Carl Hulse WASHINGTON  Welcome to the new reality of Supreme Court confirmation hearings  pandemonium, protesters and razor-sharp partisan lines. Thirty years of warfare over judicial nominations culminated on Tuesday in the chaotic beginning of Senate consideration of the nomination of Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, a tumultuous 90-minute first act that no one in the hearing room had ever seen before in decades of such events. Democrats on the typically staid, decorous committee immediately interrupted Senator Charles E. Grassley, the Iowa Republican who leads the panel, as he opened the proceedings. They sought to postpone the hearing, fuming over a Labor Day night dump of 42,000 pages of documents less than 24 hours before the committee would convene. Protesters, mostly women, shouted objections to Judge Kavanaugh and President Trump from the public seats throughout the day and were ejected by the Capitol Police. Republicans, many of them well acquainted with Judge Kavanaugh for years, seethed. Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Republican, lamented that the committee was being subjected to mob rule and that if the hearing room was a courtroom, the Democrats would be held in contempt. The nominee  and his family and friends  sat stoically absorbing the scene that must have been somewhat overwhelming. But it should not have been unexpected. Democrats, with little recourse for stopping the nomination under changes in Senate confirmation practices, were determined to make a loud show of resistance and deploy any available weapons, which at this stage amounted to lodging procedural objections, issuing vehement complaints and articulating fears about the decline of the Senates role in confirmations. Im just sorry to see the Senate Judiciary Committee descend this way, said Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont and a former chairman of the panel. Ive felt privileged to serve here under both Republican and Democratic leadership for over 40 years. This is not the Senate Judiciary Committee I saw when I came to the U.S. Senate. The intense clash came just days after a series of memorial services for Senator John McCain and a call to bipartisanship, but that sentiment was definitely not in attendance at the hearing. Republicans wryly noted that Democrats admitted they had conferred with Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, over the weekend about their hearing strategy. Senator Ben Sasse, Republican of Nebraska, said opponents were spouting drivel and deranged comments about Judge Kavanaugh. Republicans circulated their scorecard listing the number of Democratic interruptions (63) versus mentions of Judge Kavanaughs judicial opinions (just 12). Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, attributed the commotion to folks who want to run for president, who want their moment in the spotlight. Frankly, I wish we could drop all this nonsense, Mr. Hatch said. But Democrats were in no mood to drop their furious objections. Their central complaint is that Republicans have moved forward with the confirmation despite the fact that tens of thousands of documents from Judge Kavanaughs time in the White House have not been disclosed and that the National Archives was not given time to do its own traditional records review. Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois and longtime member of the panel, told Judge Kavanaugh that the lack of records amounts to a 35-month black hole in your White House career. To Democrats, the Kavanaugh timetable stands in stark  and infuriating  contrast to the Republican decision in 2016 to deny any hearing at all to Judge Merrick B. Garland, President Barack Obamas nominee to replace Justice Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court after his death. When Justice Scalia died, Republicans refused to even meet  even a meeting in their office  with President Obamas nominee and held the seat open for one year, said Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the senior Democrat on the panel. Now with a Republican in the White House, theyve changed their position. The majority rushed into this hearing and is refusing to even look at the nominees full record. Republicans responded that the real way to judge the nominees record was through his more than 300 opinions while on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, calling much of the material sought by Democrats irrelevant. Reviewing Judge Kavanaughs staff secretary documents would teach us nothing about his legal views, Mr. Grassley said. The hearing is presenting a formidable challenge to Mr. Grassley, who over his long career has sought to cultivate a reputation for fairness. Democrats appealed to that desire to be seen as equitable, even as they carefully criticized the way he is presiding over the Kavanaugh review. Sir, based upon your own principles, your own values, I call for at least to have a debate or a vote on these issues and not for us to rush through this process, said Senator Cory Booker, Democrat of New Jersey, who has worked closely with Mr. Grassley on criminal justice issues. At the same time, Mr. Grassley was pressed by his own Republican Party for giving Democrats too much latitude in making their case. But Mr. Grassley said he was willing to take as long as it might to move forward. Were going to be in session Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday until we get done this week, Mr. Grassley said. So however long people want to take, were going to not necessarily accommodate all obstruction, but if people got something to say, this chairmans going to let them say it. Democrats say their concerns about the nomination, the hearing and the way it was being conducted were only heightened by Mr. Trumps weekend tweet expressing unhappiness with the recent indictment of two House Republicans. They seem certain to press Judge Kavanaugh about the presidents view and his own on whether the president is above the law. As a former prosecutor, this is abhorrent to me, Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, said about the presidents tweet. Democrats know they have little chance of slowing, let alone stopping, the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh as Republicans seem solidly behind him. Senator Mazie K. Hirono, Democrat of Hawaii, admitted as much, saying that some battles are worth fighting despite the likely outcome. And Democrats appear quite ready to fight to the extent they can.

Shear, Adam Liptak and Sheryl Gay Stolberg WASHINGTON  Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh, President Trumps nominee to the Supreme Court, on Wednesday dodged direct questions about whether the Constitution would allow Mr. Trump to use the powers of the presidency to thwart the Russia collusion and obstruction investigations that are swirling around his administration. Testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee on a grueling second day of hearings, Judge Kavanaugh refused to say whether he believes Mr. Trump, as a sitting president, could be subpoenaed by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, to testify in the sprawling inquiry. Answering questions in public for the first time since his nomination, the judge also declined to say whether Mr. Trump could escape legal jeopardy by pardoning himself or his associates. Im not going to answer hypothetical questions of that sort, Judge Kavanaugh said, insisting that it would be inappropriate for a Supreme Court nominee to publicly offer views on issues that might come before the court once he is a justice. Judge Kavanaugh also declined to say he would disqualify himself from cases concerning Mr. Trump. In a hearing that began in the morning, stretched into the night, and seesawed between intense grilling by Democrats and fawning praise by Republicans, Judge Kavanaugh sought to present himself as an evenhanded arbiter of the law rather than a partisan ideologue driven by a desire to carry out a Republican policy agenda. He parried questions, without any obvious blunders, on matters ranging from abortion to gun rights to executive powers and arcane provisions of antitrust law. At least two more days of hearings remain, but absent a startling revelation, he appears headed to confirmation by the end of the month because Republicans remain largely united behind his nomination. But Judge Kavanaugh did little to win over Democrats. Speaking generally, he insisted that he would be an independent justice prepared to rule against the president who appointed him. No one is above the law in our constitutional system, he said. At the same time, he did not retreat from views offered in law review articles that revealed a robust conception of presidential power, views he said had been forged in large part by five years of service in the White House under President George W. Bush. Under attack from progressives and Democrats who say he will roll back abortion rights, Judge Kavanaugh said he believes that Roe v. Wade, the 1973 landmark Supreme Court case establishing a womans right to an abortion, was settled as a precedent of the Supreme Court, and as such, deserves respect from judges. But he did not say whether he believes Roe was correctly decided. But then he noted a subsequent case, the 1992 case of Planned Parenthood v. Casey, which narrowed the scope of Roe at the same time that it reaffirmed Roe as a precedent. Casey, which gave states the authority to regulate abortion so long as those regulations do not pose an undue burden on the woman, is precedent on precedent, he said. On that issue and others, Judge Kavanaugh repeatedly sought to demonstrate empathy, telling senators that when it comes to understanding the real-life implications of abortion, I dont live in a bubble. I understand. I live in the real world. He defended his dissent last year in Garza v. Hargan, in which he argued that the Trump administration should have been allowed to temporarily block an undocumented teenager from having an abortion while it sought to place her with a sponsor. He said he had followed Supreme Court precedents, even as he acknowledged that there was no directly applicable case. I did my level best in an emergency posture, Judge Kavanaugh said. He said that took the teenagers situation into account. I tried to recognize the real-world effects on her, he said. I said consider the circumstances. Shes a 17-year-old, by herself, in a foreign country. In a facility where shes detained. And she has no one to talk to. And shes pregnant. Now that is a difficult situation. Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, said Judge Kavanaugh had participated in an attempt to deny the teenager access to a constitutional right, placing her health at risk. [Have questions about the hearings? Submit them for our Supreme Court correspondent.] Protesters continued to interrupt the hearing, adding to the tension after an opening day on Tuesday in which dozens of people were arrested after loudly disrupting the proceedings. There were more arrests on Wednesday. One woman was led out of the hearing room shouting sham president, sham justice; another hollered, Youre gaslighting the American people, drowning out Judge Kavanaugh as he calmly carried on. Democratic senators angrily railed against a swiftly moving confirmation process, accusing Republicans on the committee of refusing to make public documents that they said call into question Judge Kavanaughs honesty about his past congressional testimony and his record as a political operative and a lawyer in the Bush White House. Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, raised two Bush-era scandals with Judge Kavanaugh, and he suggested that Bush White House emails in the Judiciary Committees possession may contradict testimony the nominee made more than a decade ago  if only they could be released publicly. One of the scandals was the disclosure in late 2003 and 2004 that a Republican Judiciary Committee staff member had infiltrated the Democrats confidential internal files about which of President George W. Bushs judicial nominees to try to block and with what tactics. The other was the disclosure that after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, the Bush administration had secretly ordered the National Security Agency to intercept Americans phone calls and emails without obtaining the judicial warrants seemingly required by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. At his appeals court confirmation hearing in 2006, Judge Kavanaugh  who had worked as an associate White House counsel in the Bush administration  told senators that he did not know anything about the infiltration of Senate Democrats files on judicial nomination fights or about the warrantless wiretapping program before they eventually became public. But Mr. Leahy indicated that documents marked committee confidential  and kept secret from the public  provide evidence that Judge Kavanaugh had contact with Manuel Miranda, then a Republican staff member on the Judiciary Committee, and had more involvement with the surveillance program than he had acknowledged. I am concerned because there is evidence that Mr. Miranda provided you with materials that were stolen from me, Mr. Leahy said. And that would contradict your prior testimony. It is also clear from public emails  and Im refraining from going into nonpublic ones  that you had reason to believe materials were obtained inappropriately at the time. Judge Kavanaugh insisted that everything he had testified to before was 100 percent accurate, but indicated that he was not sure what Mr. Leahy was referring to. With Democrats casting him as a partisan who was nominated by Mr. Trump only to protect the president, Judge Kavanaugh spent considerable time trying to demonstrate his independence. One case he cited to buttress his argument was notable: United States v. Nixon, the 1974 decision in which the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that President Richard M. Nixon had to comply with a subpoena seeking tapes of his conversations in the Oval Office. In 1999, Judge Kavanaugh mused aloud that maybe Nixon was wrongly decided. He made the statement soon after serving under Ken Starr, the independent counsel who investigated President Bill Clinton. Judge Kavanaughs allies have said he meant the statement as a critique of the legal strategy of Mr. Clintons lawyers. But on Wednesday, he called it one of the greatest moments because of the political pressures of the time. The courts stood up for judicial independence in a moment of national crisis, Judge Kavanaugh said, ranking the decision as one of the Supreme Courts greatest achievements. Judge Kavanaugh also sought to portray himself as an advocate for women. He described sexual harassment allegations against Alex Kozinski, a former federal appellate judge for whom he once clerked, as a gut punch for me, and said he knew nothing of the behavior. And he told the committee he has made aggressive effort to hire female clerks; 25 of his 48 clerks were women. Judge Kavanaugh sidestepped questions from Senator Cory Booker, Democrat of New Jersey, about his personal views on affirmative action and racial profiling, even as Mr. Booker said Judge Kavanaugh was hostile to affirmation action and open to racial profiling. But the judge defended his decision upholding South Carolinas voter identification law, arguing that he had taken the real-world effect into account and had forced the state to take steps to insure that the law did not impose an undue burden on black people. On gun rights, Judge Kavanaugh told the committee the Second Amendment protected the right of Americans to own semiautomatic rifles because they are in common use and not a dangerous and unusual weapon  a position he took in a much-publicized 2011 dissent, which he said was rooted in Supreme Court precedent. That prompted an outcry from Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the top Democrat on the judiciary panel. How do you reconcile what youve just said with the hundreds of school shootings using assault weapons that have taken place in recent history? she asked. Senator, of course the violence in the schools is something we all detest, the judge replied. But he added, As a judge my job, as I saw it, was to follow the Second Amendment opinion of the Supreme Court.

The country listened as they relayed their accounts of what happened 35 years ago, when she says he sexually assaulted her at a house party, and he says neither the party nor the assault occurred. But while viewers may have watched the same hearing, they did not interpret it through a neutral conduit. Whether you followed along with a news outlets livestream or liveblog, watched the event on cable news, or relied on Twitter to curate a highlight reel, your experience was mediated and  shaped by the filter bubbles that dictate whose opinions you see when you read things on the web. Where some see sober, science-backed credibility, other see a circus. Its a story thats all too typical in this period of political polarization. If you are liberaland in this political climate, were calling readers of The New York Times, The Washington Post, and CNN liberalsyou went on the internet this morning and saw a flood of #BelieveWomen tweets and women talking about how Blasey Fords testimony moved them to tears. Or maybe you saw The New York Times, CNNs, or BuzzFeeds coverage of the tearful morning. As the day went on, that constellation of publications trumpeted Blasey Fords credibilityboth The Atlantic and the Times pointed to Blasey Fords scientific background as being a particular asset to her testimonyand highlighted how painful the account was for Blasey Ford as well. You may have also read that the Republicans' prosecutor, Rachel Mitchell, is known for her evenhanded treatment of sex crimes cases and that theall-white-maleRepublican sides reliance on an outside investigator reflects poorly on them. https://twitter.com/KamalaHarris/status/1045373648486436864 Another key liberal theme of the day is the behavior of conservatives. CNN emphasized that one-time Republican presidential candidate Rick Santorum said that Blasey Ford is not lying, and The Washington Post devoted an entire article to Fox News Chris Wallace talking about how Blasey Fords testimony prompted his own daughters to speak out and why it would be a big mistake to disregard her story. You may have also read about more disturbing behavior: Senator Orrin Hatch calling Blasey Ford a good, attractive witness, former Trump campaign aide Michael Caputo having a meltdown on CNN, and Senator Lindsey Grahams meltdown about feeling ambushed and telling Democrats to watch out for your nominees. If you lean further left, words like embarrassment and cruel came to characterize the proceedings, and the machinations of ultraconservative commentators became stories in their own right. In this bubble, truth and progressive politics won the day. https://twitter.com/DineshDSouza/status/1045296352983482369 But if you are conservative, you went on the internet today and saw a deluge of #BackBrett tweets, a great deal about flying, and a lot of lamenting. Fox News' Stuart Varney and Chris Wallace both pointed a finger at Rachel Mitchell for doing a poor job as a GOP intermediaryWallace called the testimony as directed by Mitchell a disaster for Republicans and Varney wondered why Blasey Ford was being treated with absolute maximum caution in the first place. The other conservative talking points have come from the small discrepancies Mitchell was able to find in Blasey Fords testimony: her confusion over who paid for her polygraph test, her equivocation about how many people were at the party, her confusion about whether The Washington Post had reviewed notes from her therapist, and most of all, her fear of flying to Washington for this testimony when she has been able to fly before. (The flying controversy has become the linchpin of Breitbarts coverage in particular.) The conservative narrative forming around this is that Blasey Ford simply isnt trustworthy, and that the foggy, 35-year-old he-said, she-said routine undermines the authority of Congress and unduly smears Kavanaugh. The dynamic shifted once Kavanaugh took the stand, where he gave a 45-minute impassioned speech and had testy exchanges with the Democratic senators questioning him. The liberal internet again zeroed in on conservative comportment. Kavanaughs opening read to that filter bubble as unduly angry and political for a Supreme Court nominee. The aggression he displayed when being questioned by Senator Amy Klobuchar about his drinkingand his apology for itbecame its own tale. Lindsay Grahams send-up of what he perceives as Democratic foot-dragging came off as hypocritical at best, given Republicans efforts to block President Obamas Supreme Court nominees, and an irresponsible temper tantrum at worst. Much was made over Kavanaughs supposed evasive behavior when asked about FBI investigations or Mark Judge, who Blasey Ford claims was with him on the night of the assault. Thumbnail images show Kavanaughs face pinched in an angry frown. To conservatives, Kavanaugh's and Grahams ire were worth celebrating. In some cases, the nominee was instantly, implicitly believed: Kavanaugh Clears His Name, Breitbart says. Over on Fox News, Graham tears into Democrats while Trump blasts them. Kavanaugh appears far more sympathetic in coverage that highlights his testimony about his young daughter praying for Blasey Ford. These stances are wildly, maybe disastrously, different. Each side casts the other as inappropriate and lionizes their own entrants into the fray. And as these narratives grow, change, and refract their way across the internetbeing discussed and rehashed by people in their own corners of the political spectrum as they gothe gap between them is likely to widen. Partisan narrative has come to trump attempted objectivity. Its hard to imagine a scenario where thats less appropriate than when trying to determine whether a man is fit to be an objective arbiter of truth and justice for an entire nation.

Here’s a look at three of them.,center,text,2018-09-05T23:18:57Z,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,"Advertisement Supported by Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh spent a long day answering  and often failing to answer  questions about some of the most pressing issues that could reach the Supreme Court in the years ahead. Heres a look at three of them. By Adam Liptak Asked about the constitutional right to abortion, Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh talked instead about precedent. He described the Supreme Courts two key decisions: Roe v. Wade, the 1973 ruling that established a constitutional right to abortion, and Planned Parenthood v. Casey, the 1992 decision that reaffirmed the core of that right. Collectively, he said, the two decisions held that a woman has a constitutional right to obtain an abortion before viability subject to reasonable regulation by the state up to the point where that regulation constitutes an undue burden on the womans right to obtain an abortion. But that was description, not endorsement. He did suggest that the Roe decision may be a particularly secure precedent. Its not as if its just a run-of-the-mill case that was decided and never been reconsidered, he said. That makes Casey a precedent on precedent. Like earlier nominees, he recited the reasons offered in the Casey decision for leaving precedents undisturbed, including whether people have relied on the decisions, whether the decisions have proved workable as a practical matter and what impact overruling them would have on public perception of the Supreme Courts legitimacy. People rely on the decisions of the courts, and so reliance interests are critically important to consider as a matter of precedent, Judge Kavanaugh said. Precedent also reinforces the impartiality and independence of the judiciary, he said. The people need to know in this country that the judges are independent, and that were not making decisions based on policy views. But Judge Kavanaugh did not say whether he would be prepared to reconsider Roe, and he declined an invitation to agree with a statement from the Casey decision that the right to abortion allows women to participate equally in the economic and social life of the nation. He said instead that the right to abortion was settled as a precedent of the Supreme Court. That statement is less categorical than it appears at first blush. To call a decision settled law is not to say it is set in stone. Judge Kavanaugh expressed dismay about gun violence. But he defended a robust view of Second Amendment rights. He was asked about his 2011 dissent in a case that upheld a ban in Washington on so-called assault weapons. The case was a sequel to District of Columbia v. Heller, the 2008 Supreme Court decision that established a constitutional right to own handguns for self-defense in the home, striking down an earlier Washington law. The majority in the appeals court ruled that the later ban was constitutional. On Wednesday, Judge Kavanaugh explained that he dissented because Justice Antonin Scalias majority opinion in the 2008 decision required it. He acknowledged that Justice Scalia had said that many gun control laws were unaffected by the 2008 ruling. Nothing in our opinion, Justice Scalia wrote, should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms. Judge Kavanaugh also said that the 2008 decision allowed machine guns to be prohibited, along with dangerous and unusual weapons. But he said semiautomatic weapons presented a different question. Most handguns are semiautomatic  something not everyone appreciates, Judge Kavanaugh said on Wednesday. Similarly, he said, semiautomatic rifles are widely possessed in the United States. I have to follow the precedent of the Supreme Court as its written, and thats what I tried to do in that case, he said. Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, asked Judge Kavanaugh about the practical impact of his position in light of recent school shootings. He responded that school officials have taken steps to protect students. Senator, he said, of course the violence in the schools is something we all detest and want to do something about, and there are lots of efforts, I know, underway to make schools safer. I know at my girls school they do a lot of things now that are different than they did just a few years ago in terms of trying to harden the school and make it safer for everyone. But as a judge my job, as I saw it, he said, was to follow the Second Amendment opinion of the Supreme Court whether I agreed with it or disagreed with it. Judge Kavanaugh made broad pronouncements on the independence of the judiciary, and he praised the Supreme Courts unanimous 1974 decision ordering President Richard M. Nixon to comply with a subpoena seeking tapes of his conversations in the Oval Office. It was one of the greatest moments because of the political pressures of the time, he said of the decision, United States v. Nixon. The courts stood up for judicial independence in a moment of national crisis. That ruling would, of course, figure in the resolution of any dispute between Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election, and President Trump. It was hard to escape the conclusion that Judge Kavanaugh was trying to assure senators that he might be prepared to rule against the president who nominated him, as Chief Justice Warren Burger did in the Nixon tapes case. But when Judge Kavanaugh was asked more specific questions about Mr. Trump, he declined to answer. Can a sitting president be required to respond to a subpoena? Ms. Feinstein asked. Judge Kavanaugh said that was a hypothetical question about what would be an elaboration or a difference from U.S. v. Nixons precise holding. I cant give you an answer on that hypothetical question, he said. He gave a similar answer to whether Mr. Trump could pardon himself. The question of self-pardons is something Ive never analyzed, he said. It is a question that Ive not written about. It is a question therefore that is a hypothetical question that I cant begin to answer in this context as a sitting judge and as a nominee to the Supreme Court.

Kavanaugh are set to emerge on Tuesday when he appears on Capitol Hill for the opening of his Supreme Court confirmation hearings. One is a champion for women; the other a threat to womens rights. Republicans will present Judge Kavanaugh to the nation as an experienced, independent-minded jurist with a sparkling rsum, and as an advocate and mentor for women in the judiciary. Among the cases they will cite: his 2009 ruling in favor of Emilys List, the group that backs Democratic women who support abortion rights. Democrats will tell an entirely different story, painting Judge Kavanaugh as a far-right extremist who would roll back abortion rights, deny health coverage to people with pre-existing conditions, protect President Trump from the threat of subpoena  and as someone who may have misled Congress when he testified during his appeals court confirmation hearing in 2006. Those two competing narratives will define the contours of a deeply partisan and immensely consequential battle over Mr. Trumps Supreme Court nominee. But while Democrats vowed early on to scuttle the Kavanaugh nomination  Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader, promised to oppose him with everything Ive got  they are unlikely to find success. Democrats have been unable to muster much public outrage over his nomination or Republicans refusal to grant them full access to documents from Judge Kavanaughs time working for former President George W. Bush. Even the Trump White Houses decision over the weekend to keep 100,000 pages secret produced little blowback. On Monday night, just 13 hours before the hearings were to begin, lawyers for Mr. Bush gave the Senate 42,000 pages of confidential documents, prompting an irate Mr. Schumer to call the document production process absurd, on Twitter, adding, Not a single senator will be able to review these records before tomorrow. Democrats also fell flat in their effort to delay the hearings after Mr. Trumps former lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, implicated the president in a hush-money scheme to influence the 2016 election. Judge Kavanaugh, 53, has spent the past 12 years on the federal appeals court here  a traditional steppingstone to the Supreme Court. If he is confirmed, he will shape the course of American jurisprudence for generations to come, filling the seat long occupied by the retired Justice Anthony M. Kennedy  a critical swing vote on divisive matters like same-sex marriage and abortion  with a committed conservative who would push a rightward-leaning court even further in that direction. The stakes are so high, said Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut and a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Were talking about a vote on the United States Supreme Court that could well decide whether women can decide when they want to have children, and whether Americans can decide whom they want to marry. But Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the Judiciary Committee chairman, argued in an interview Monday that it was folly to try to predict how Judge Kavanaugh might vote on any given matter. How do I know what hes going to rule on 10 years from now? Mr. Grassley asked. All I want is somebody thats going to interpret the Constitution strictly and leave legislating to the Congress of the United States, and I think hes the sort of guy who will do that. The hearings will play out for the next four days before the judiciary panel, with opening statements on Tuesday by senators and Judge Kavanaugh, followed by two days of questioning and a final day of testimony from outside witnesses. As Mr. Blumenthal, perhaps in a moment of understatement, predicted, Sparks will fly. Judge Kavanaughs views on reproductive rights and Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 case legalizing abortion, will take center stage. In addition to demanding to know whether he believes the case was correctly decided  a question he is all but certain to refuse to answer  Democrats will question him aggressively about his dissent in the case of Garza v. Hargan, in which he argued that a 17-year-old undocumented immigrant should not be permitted to have an immediate abortion. They have called Rochelle Garza, the girls lawyer, as a witness. And in this era of #MeToo, Democrats also plan to raise pointed questions about Judge Kavanaughs views on sexual harassment. Senator Mazie Hirono, Democrat of Hawaii, plans to ask Judge Kavanaugh if he has ever sexually harassed anyone  a question she said she asks of all nominees  and will also ask him about a judge for whom he clerked, Alex Kozinski, who abruptly retired last year from the federal appeals court amid harassment allegations. Republicans intend to push back by highlighting Judge Kavanaughs record of hiring female clerks  25 of his 48 clerks have been women  and by making the case that he has taken pains to mentor women. Among those who will formally introduce him on Tuesday are Condoleezza Rice, the former secretary of state, and Lisa S. Blatt, a self-described liberal Democrat and feminist lawyer who has advocated Judge Kavanaughs confirmation. We want to lay the groundwork to show that this has been a judge who is empowering and mentoring women, said one Senate Republican aide, speaking anonymously to discuss strategy. Judge Kavanaugh has expressed strong support for executive power, hostility to administrative agencies, and support for religious freedom and for gun rights. Democrats will press him on all of these topics, but are expected to drill especially deeply into his assertion, in a 2009 Minnesota Law Review article, that sitting presidents should be excused from some of the burdens of ordinary citizenship, including responding to civil and criminal lawsuits. Those comments are especially relevant in light of the special counsel investigation being led by Robert S. Mueller III. Democrats want Judge Kavanaugh to commit to recusing himself from ruling on matters involving that inquiry  a commitment he will undoubtedly avoid making. But perhaps the most blistering accusation Democrats will levy is that Judge Kavanaugh was untruthful during his 2006 testimony, when he told the judiciary panel that he was not involved in the questions about the rules governing the treatment of terror suspects. A White House spokesman, Raj Shah, has said the testimony accurately reflected the facts. An email, recently made public as part of a trove of Bush records, shows that while working in the Bush White House Counsels Office, the future judge volunteered to prepare a senior Bush administration official to testify about the governments monitoring of conversations between certain terrorism suspects and their lawyers. Democrats, led by Senators Richard J. Durbin of Illinois and Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, had questioned Judge Kavanaughs veracity even before that emails release. In an interview, Mr. Leahy drew a comparison between Judge Kavanaugh and Judge Jay S. Bybee, who was confirmed to the federal appeals court in 2003  years before the release of memos showing that, as head of the Justice Departments Office of Legal Counsel, he had given the C.I.A. its first detailed legal approval for waterboarding and other harsh interrogation techniques. Had that come out before the confirmation, Mr. Leahy said, I doubt very much that he would have been confirmed. In a narrowly divided Senate  50 Republicans, 47 Democrats and two independents who caucus with Democrats  the Kavanaugh nomination could be defeated if all Democrats hang together and one Republican votes no. But two Republicans most likely to cross the aisle, Senators Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine, both supporters of abortion rights, have made favorable comments about Judge Kavanaugh. And at least three Democrats  Joe Donnelly of Indiana, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Joe Manchin III of West Virginia  are facing re-election in states won by Mr. Trump and are under intense pressure to vote in favor. None of those senators are on the Judiciary Committee. Supreme Court confirmation hearings are always as much about political theater as they are about substance, and Judge Kavanaughs will be no exception. Several Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee  Cory Booker of New Jersey, Kamala Harris of California and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota  are possible 2020 presidential aspirants and will no doubt take advantage of the free national television exposure. Judge Kavanaugh, too, will take advantage of that limelight. In the nearly two months since Mr. Trump nominated him, he has been a silent presence in Washington, traipsing through the corridors of the Capitol complex, trailed by a retinue of security officers and advisers, as he made the customary courtesy visits to senators. Now he will have a chance to speak for himself, spotlighting his academic pedigree  he has undergraduate and law degrees from Yale  and addressing questions not only about his judicial record, but also the more contentious aspects of his rsum, including his days working for Kenneth W. Starr, the independent counsel who investigated former President Bill Clinton. While there, he urged prosecutors to pose graphic questions to Mr. Clinton about his relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky  a history that Democrats will invoke as they try to cast Judge Kavanaugh as a partisan political operative. Will the real Brett Kavanaugh please stand up? said Carrie Severino, chief counsel and policy director of the Judicial Crisis Network, a conservative advocacy group. You hear very contrasting views. This is a chance for people to see who is telling the truth about Judge Kavanaugh, and what is just spin.

To jam Judge Kavanaughs confirmation through now, without seeking to dispel the darkening cloud over his head, would be to leave the public in doubt about his honesty and character  and to set an even lower standard for taking claims of sexual abuse seriously than the Senate did 27 years ago in considering the accusations against Clarence Thomas by Anita Hill. Yes, partisan games have no doubt been played on both sides. But the only reason for so much urgency about this confirmation is politics; the same cannot be said about calls for holding a fair and thorough investigation.  To recap: On Wednesday morning, the bomb-throwing lawyer Michael Avenatti made public an affidavit from Julie Swetnick, a woman who grew up in the Washington suburbs and claims to have traveled the same 1980s social circuit as Judge Kavanaugh. Ms. Swetnick says that he drank excessively at many parties she attended; that he was verbally abusive and physically aggressive toward young women, fondling and grabbing them; and that he was part of a group of young men who would spike the punch at parties with alcohol or illicit drugs with an eye toward incapacitating the female attendees, including Ms. Swetnick herself, and then abusing them.  These are grotesque charges  and, like the previous ones, they leave oceans of room for speculation and doubt. This is precisely why the Senate needs to stop trying to ram through this nomination by some arbitrary deadline and arrange for a thorough and nonpartisan inquiry. Unlike Christine Blasey Ford or Deborah Ramirez, Ms. Swetnick is not claiming to have been assaulted directly by Judge Kavanaugh. But her accusations directly speak to his repeated insistence that he never behaved in a demeaning or disrespectful manner toward women. In his recent interview on Fox News, the nominee, seated primly beside his wife, presented his teenage self as a virtual choir boy, chastely focused on academics and sports and weekly church attendance. The nominee even said that he remained a virgin throughout high school and for many years thereafter. That was a risky defense, and Judge Kavanaugh seems to be reconsidering it. In an opening statement prepared for him to deliver at his appearance before the Judiciary Committee on Thursday, the nominee now allows that he was not perfect in high school. He admits that he may have drunk too much on occasion (though rarely on school nights) and that he may have said and done things that now make him cringe. Yet he maintains that it is inconceivable that he would have sexually wronged anyone at any time. And he fiercely brushes aside all of the accusations to arise after Dr. Blasey came forward as part of plot against him. Over the past few days, other false and uncorroborated accusations have been aired, his prepared statement says. There has been a frenzy to come up with something  anything, no matter how far-fetched or odious  that will block a vote on my nomination. These are last-minute smears, pure and simple. This claim of victimhood will most likely endear the judge to President Trump, who said at a news conference Wednesday that the accusations against Judge Kavanaugh were all false. (The president also said he would watch Dr. Blaseys testimony and said he could possibly find it convincing.) It is also likely to play well with more retrograde lawmakers like Orrin Hatch, whose response to Ms. Swetnicks allegations was to insist that Judge Kavanaugh is the real victim here. It shows there are people who would stop at nothing, Mr. Hatch told CNN. I dont think we should put up with it, to be honest with you. In saner times, the Senate would have paused in its mad rush to confirm Judge Kavanaugh when the first credible allegations of sexual assault surfaced. As things stand, Chuck Grassley, the head of the Senate Judiciary Committee, has shrugged off these latest accusations and asserted that the show will go on without further inconvenience or delay. This is dereliction of the Senates duty  and it is now up to senators who know better, who prize the dignity and duty of their chamber, to demonstrate that they are indeed something more than partisan tools. This is not, as Republicans have claimed, a matter of demanding the destruction of a mans career based on vague or unsubstantiated claims. It is a matter of treating such allegations with the proper gravity. There is no other way to protect the integrity of the nominating process  and of the nations highest court.

By The Editorial Board The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section. What a study in contrasts: Where Christine Blasey Ford was calm and dignified, Brett Kavanaugh was volatile and belligerent; where she was eager to respond fully to every questioner, and kept worrying whether she was being helpful enough, he was openly contemptuous of several senators; most important, where she was credible and unshakable at every point in her testimony, he was at some points evasive, and some of his answers strained credulity. Indeed, Dr. Blaseys testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday was devastating. With the eyes of the nation on her, Dr. Blasey recounted an appalling trauma. When she was 15 years old, she said, she was sexually assaulted by Judge Kavanaugh, then a 17-year-old student at a nearby high school and now President Trumps nominee to the Supreme Court. Her description of the attack, which she said occurred in a suburban Maryland home on a summer night in 1982, was gut-wrenchingly specific. She said Judge Kavanaugh and his friend, Mark Judge, both of whom she described as very drunk, locked her in a second-floor room of a private home. She said Kavanaugh jumped on top of her, groped her, tried to remove her clothes and put his hand over her mouth to keep her from screaming. She said she feared he might accidentally kill her. The uproarious laughter between the two and their having fun at my expense, she said, was her strongest memory.  Judge Kavanaugh, when it was his turn, was not laughing. He was yelling. He spent more than half an hour raging against Senate Democrats and the Left for totally and permanently destroying his name, his career, his family, his life. He called his confirmation process a national disgrace.  You may defeat me in the final vote, but you will never get me to quit, Judge Kavanaugh said, sounding like someone who suddenly doubted his confirmation to the Supreme Court  an outcome that seemed preordained only a couple of weeks ago. Judge Kavanaughs defiant fury might be understandable coming from someone who believes himself innocent of the grotesque charges hes facing. Yet it was also evidence of an unsettling temperament in a man trying to persuade the nation of his judicial demeanor.  We share the sorrow of every sensible American who feels stricken at the partisan spectacle playing out in Washington. Judge Kavanaugh was doubtless  and lamentably  correct in predicting that after this confirmation fight, however it ends, the bitterness is only likely to grow. As he put it in his testimony, What goes around, comes around, in the partisan vortex that has been intensifying in Washington for decades now. His open contempt for the Democrats on the committee also raised further questions about his own fair-mindedness, and it served as a reminder of his decades as a Republican warrior who would take no prisoners.  Judge Kavanaughs biggest problem was not his demeanor but his credibility, which has been called in question on multiple issues for more than a decade, and has been an issue again throughout his Supreme Court confirmation process. On Thursday, he gave misleading answers to questions about seemingly small matters  sharpening doubts about his honesty about far more significant ones. He gave coy answers when pressed about what was clearly a sexual innuendo in his high-school yearbook. He insisted over and over that others Dr. Blasey named as attending the gathering had said it didnt happen, when in fact at least two of them have said only that they dont recall it  and one of them told a reporter that she believes Dr. Blasey. Judge Kavanaugh clumsily dodged a number of times when senators asked him about his drinking habits. When Senator Amy Klobuchar gently pressed him about whether hed ever blacked out from drinking, he at first wouldnt reply directly. I dont know, have you? he replied  a condescending and dismissive response to the legitimate exercise of a senators duty of advise and consent. (Later, after a break in the hearing, he apologized.)  Judge Kavanaugh gave categorical denials a number of times, including, at other points, that hed ever blacked out from too much drinking. Given numerous reports now of his heavy drinking in college, such a blanket denial is hard to believe.  In contrast, Dr. Blasey bolstered her credibility not only by describing in harrowing detail what she did remember, but by being honest about what she didnt  like the exact date of the gathering, or the address of the house where it occurred. As she pointed out, the precise details of a trauma get burned into the brain and stay there long after less relevant details fade away. She was also honest about her ambivalence in coming forward. I am terrified, she told the senators in her opening remarks. And then theres the fact that she gains nothing by coming forward. She is in hiding now with her family in the face of death threats. Perhaps the most maddening part of Thursdays hearing was the cowardice of the committees 11 Republicans, all of them men, and none of them, apparently, capable of asking Dr. Blasey a single question. They farmed that task out to a sex-crimes prosecutor named Rachel Mitchell, who tried unsuccessfully in five-minute increments to poke holes in Dr. Blaseys story.  Eventually, as Judge Kavanaugh testified, the Republican senators ventured out from behind their shield. Doubtless seeking to ape Presidents Trump style and win his approval, they began competing with each other to make the most ferocious denunciation of their Democratic colleagues and the most heartfelt declaration of sympathy for Judge Kavanaugh, in a show of empathy far keener than they managed to muster for Dr. Blasey.  Pressed over and over by Democratic senators, Judge Kavanaugh never could come up with a clear answer for why he wouldnt also want a fair, neutral F.B.I. investigation into the allegations against him  the kind of investigation the agency routinely performs, and that Dr. Blasey has called for. At one point, though, he acknowledged that it was common sense to put some questions to other potential witnesses besides him. When Senator Patrick Leahy asked whether the judge was the inspiration for a hard-drinking character named Bart OKavanaugh in a memoir about teenage alcoholism by Mr. Judge, Judge Kavanaugh replied, You'd have to ask him. Asking Mr. Judge would be a great idea. Unfortunately hes hiding out in a Delaware beach town and Senate Republicans are refusing to subpoena him. Why? Mr. Judge is the key witness in Dr. Blaseys allegation. He has said he has no recollection of the party or of any assault. But he hasnt faced live questioning to test his own memory and credibility. And Dr. Blasey is far from alone in describing Judge Kavanaugh and Mr. Judge as heavy drinkers; several of Judge Kavanaughs college classmates have said the same. None of these people have been called to testify before the Senate. President Trump has refused to call on the F.B.I. to look into the multiple allegations that have been leveled against the judge in the past two weeks. Instead the Republican majority on the committee has scheduled a vote for Friday morning. There is no reason the committee needs to hold this vote before the F.B.I. can do a proper investigation, and Mr. Judge and possibly other witnesses can be called to testify under oath. The Senate, and the American people, need to know the truth, or as close an approximation as possible, before deciding whether Judge Kavanaugh should get a lifetime seat on the nations highest court. If the committee will not make a more serious effort, the only choice for senators seeking to protect the credibility of the Supreme Court will be to vote no.

Maybe he was both.,right,text,2018-09-25T15:58:32Z,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,"Advertisement Supported by Some women saw a young gentleman. Some saw a drunk predator. Maybe he was both.  By Frank Bruni Opinion Columnist Brett Kavanaughs wife, Ashley, told Martha MacCallum of Fox News: I know Brett. Ive known him for 17 years.  But thats hardly his whole life. And thats hardly the whole Brett. She knows him mainly as a husband and a father, moved by the emotional currents that those roles stir up, distinguished by the traits that they tease out. They know Brett, she said of the couples two daughters. And they know the truth. They do indeed  part of it. But not all of it. He may be the gentlest man on earth with them. He may be a feminist in terms of their ambitions, their basketball league. But he may be nothing of the kind to women in the abstract or women who were in his path when he was very young, very inebriated and very insistent. A Yale roommate of his told The New Yorker that Kavanaugh was frequently, incoherently drunk during the time in college when, their former classmate Deborah Ramirez alleges, he exposed himself to her. Is it believable that she was alone with a wolfy group of guys who thought it was funny to sexually torment a girl like Debbie? the roommate, James Roche, said. Yeah, definitely. Is it believable that Kavanaugh was one of them? Yes. So possibly thats Kavanaugh, too. Thats him riding a wave of testosterone and booze, among similarly pumped-up, zonked-out buddies. As Brett Kavanaughs admirers and detractors stage a ferocious battle over his biography and reputation and those of us watching it try to determine what hes capable of and what hes made of, too many of us fall into a familiar trap. Hes either a wrongly tarnished angel or deceptively phlegmatic devil, prey or predator, a loyal friend or fratty enabler of bad behavior, as Kyle Swenson wrote in The Washington Post. A man like Kavanaugh couldnt do what hes accused of, or a man like him indisputably did it. His ethics are elastic and his lies abundant  about his actions in the second Bush administration, about his awareness of a mentors obsession with pornography and mistreatment of women. Or hes a primly religious, utterly devoted family man whose blemishes are the inventions and exaggerations of political foes. Thats a misleading, false dichotomy, inconsistent with everything we know about human nature and about ourselves. I dont believe that anyone persuasively accused of what Christine Blasey Ford says that Kavanaugh did to her has any business on the Supreme Court. So we must try our hardest to come to a best guess about what happened more than 35 years ago, including by listening closely to her scheduled testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday. But that effort isnt served by the caricatures that have come to dominate this discussion, as they do so many others. Those caricatures are out of sync with life. And no set of character witnesses  to Kavanaughs virtues or vices  is the final, irrefutable word. They caught a few scenes of him. They didnt see the whole messy movie. We show different colors at different times in different situations. We age, sometimes in ways that make us better, sometimes in ways that make us worse. We fashion ourselves, with or without cunning, into who and what we need to be for friends, lovers, parents, children, bosses and employees based on their diverse expectations and ever-shifting demands. We are genuinely saints and we are genuinely sinners. We are pieces that add up to an incoherent whole. In the interview that Kavanaugh and his wife gave to Fox News on Monday, he repeatedly mentioned the Sept. 14 letter that 65 women who knew him during high school signed and sent to the leaders of the Senate Judiciary Committee. It vouched for positive interactions with and impressions of him. But it doesnt mean that other women couldnt have had negative ones. A persons experience of Kavanaugh likely hinged on the circumstances. Perhaps it was the luck  or curse  of the draw. Hence the push and pull in the New Yorker article about Ramirezs charge. Some of Kavanaughs Yale classmates said that it didnt jibe with his character. Others said that it did. They arent necessarily contradicting each other. Theyre describing their partial perspectives from particular vantage points.  Kavanaugh is being typecast, but hes many types. Hes entitled. Hes diligent. Hes arrogant. Hes earnest. Hes the beer-mad treasurer of the Keg City Club, according to what he wrote in his 1983 yearbook from his all-boys Catholic secondary school, Georgetown Prep. Hes an avid consumer of legal scholarship, according to what a former professor of his at Yale Law School  a Hillary Clinton supporter  wrote in praise of him in The Times. Speaking of that yearbook, The Times on Monday night published a story, by Kate Kelly and David Enrich, about a phrase that Kavanaugh included on his page: Renate Alumnius. It was apparently an unsubstantiated boast, made by him and other football players, about Renate Schroeder, who attended an all-girls Catholic school nearby. Now known as Renate Dolphin, she was among the 65 women on that letter, and she learned only afterward  in the past few days  about the yearbook phrase. The insinuation is horrible, hurtful and simply untrue, she said in a statement to The Times. I pray their daughters are never treated this way. She knew one Kavanaugh in high school, or thought she did. Shes getting to know another in retrospect. Shes sifting through conflicting signals. Thats the task before all of us now.

By The Editorial Board The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section. Americas about fairness, Brett Kavanaugh said Monday night in an interview with Fox News. I want a fair process where I can defend my integrity and clear my name as quickly as I can. Surely there can be no question that America should be about fairness. Yet only a person accustomed to having things go his way in America would assume that it already is.  Its a horrific unfairness, for example, that for generations, untold numbers of American girls and women have had their lives derailed by sexual abuse, to use the term of one of Judge Kavanaughs accusers, Christine Blasey Ford, while the boys and men who abused them  maturing, telling themselves theyve set aside boyish ways, eliding, avoiding, forgetting  chugged along toward successful careers and public acclaim.  It would also be unfair if Judge Kavanaugh is innocent of such abuse, if he is a thoroughly honest and decent man, and yet is ultimately denied a seat on the Supreme Court because of the allegations against him.  The Senate Judiciary Committee is not a court of law, and the public cant expect its members to reach an irrefutable conclusion about what happened. Yet it is now up to these senators, who have so far been putting political calculation well ahead of the interests of justice, to give a nation in tumult over these charges the demonstration of higher purpose and moral seriousness it so desperately needs. If Judge Kavanaughs name is, in the end, to be cleared, the only path is through a thorough and fair investigation of the allegations against him.  The committees 11 Republicans  all of them men  are still refusing to call for an independent investigation, or even to subpoena Mark Judge, Mr. Kavanaughs high-school friend and allegedly a witness to the sexual assault of Dr. Blasey. So its left to those who care about getting the full story to ask as many questions as possible. Here are a few for Judge Kavanaugh, drawn only from the allegations that have arisen in the weeks since his initial confirmation hearings. Perhaps the Republican senators can get the lawyer whom Mitch McConnell has called their female assistant to ask them. Dr. Blasey alleges that you sexually assaulted her in a locked room at a house party in the summer of 1982, when you were 17 and she was 15. She alleges that you were stumbling drunk and that she feared for her life. Could she be right about any of this? Dr. Blasey alleges that Mr. Judge was in the room with you and her on the night of the alleged attack. He has said he has no recollection of that incident, or of any similar behavior during that time. Elizabeth Rasor, Mr. Judges former girlfriend, disputes this. She said he told her ashamedly of an incident that involved him and other boys taking turns having sex with a drunk woman and that he seemed to regard it as fully consensual. Do you have any knowledge of an incident like the one she describes? Last week, Edward Whelan, a conservative activist who has been closely involved with the Supreme Court nominations by previous Republican presidents, spread a theory on Twitter that Dr. Blasey was telling the truth about being attacked, but that she was mistaken about the identity of her attacker, who he suggested might have been one of your classmates. Senator Orrin Hatch said previously that you had proposed a similar theory to him. Did you have any role in developing Mr. Whelans theory? Did you have advance knowledge about his plan to go public with it? A classmate of yours at Yale, Deborah Ramirez, has alleged that you exposed yourself to her at a drunken dormitory party, thrust your penis in her face and caused her to touch it without her consent as she pushed you away. Is any element of this true? On Wednesday, Julie Swetnick, a woman who grew up in the Washington suburbs and claims to have traveled the same 1980s social circuit as you, gave a sworn statement alleging that you drank excessively at many parties she attended; that you were verbally abusive and physically aggressive toward young women, fondling and grabbing them; and that you were part of a group of young men who would spike the punch at parties with alcohol or illicit drugs with an eye toward incapacitating the female attendees, including Ms. Swetnick herself, and then raping them. Could she be right about any of this? Your high-school yearbook page includes the phrase 100 Kegs or Bust. Your friend Mr. Judge has described that as a pledge to drink 100 kegs of beer before graduation. Was that your understanding? If not, what did you mean by it? Mr. Judge has written extensively of his heavy drinking during those years. In his memoir about being a teenage alcoholic, he wrote that he drank too much and did stupid things. He added, Most of the time everyone, including the girls, was drunk. His yearbook page includes the quote, Certain women should be struck regularly, like gongs. The memoir included a character, Bart OKavanaugh, who drank so much that he threw up in a car and passed out. Was that you, and could he be correct in his description of those events? You told Fox News that you have always treated women with dignity and respect. Do you stand categorically by that statement? Your high-school yearbook page includes the phrase Renate Alumnius. A classmate of yours, Sean Hagan, explained that Renate was a girl at a nearby high school, and the reference to her by you and others on the schools football team was meant as a boast of sexual conquest. Is that what you meant by the phrase? Do you believe this is treating women with dignity and respect? At Yale, you were a member of the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity, which was reputed to disrespect women. One of your female classmates recalled that DKE brothers ransacked womens rooms, stole their undergarments and wove them into a large flag. Years later, the fraternity was suspended from campus after a video showed recruits chanting, No Means Yes, Yes Means Anal. Were you aware of any behavior like this? If so, do you believe it amounts to treating women with dignity and respect? Also at Yale, you belonged to an all-male secret society called Truth and Courage, which was known by the nickname Tit and Clit. Were you aware of this nickname? If so, do you believe it treats women with dignity and respect? More broadly, do you dispute the reputations of these groups? If you do not, did you ever feel uncomfortable about being involved with them, or raise any concerns with other members or leadership? One other matter: In your nationally televised acceptance of President Trumps nomination of you to the Supreme Court, you said, No president has ever consulted more widely or talked with more people from more backgrounds to seek input about a Supreme Court nomination. Would you provide the committee with the evidence for that assertion? And do you still stand by it?  Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter (@NYTOpinion).

By Serena Mayeri Ms. Mayeri teaches law and history at the University of Pennsylvania Law School. Judge Brett Kavanaughs voluminous record, his opinion of the Supreme Courts landmark abortion ruling, Roe v. Wade, and his views on legal precedent have deservedly been scrutinized in the lead-up to his confirmation hearings next week. But the Supreme Courts 1992 decision in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, more than Roe, holds the key to understanding the stakes of Judge Kavanaughs potential confirmation.  It is Casey that now protects womens access to reproductive health care in states whose restrictions on health care providers and patients threaten to close clinics or ban abortions outright. And the political lesson conservatives learned from Casey all but guarantees that a vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote not only to endanger abortion rights but to turn back the clock on a century of progressive reforms. On the eve of the presidential election of 1992, the court seemed poised to reconsider Roe in a case challenging several Pennsylvania abortion restrictions. Abortion-rights advocates thought Roes demise certain. They worried most that the court might gut Roe without overruling it. A decision that openly reversed Roe might galvanize abortion-rights voters in November. But if women slowly lost the right to choose abortion, no electoral reckoning would follow.  The courts decision in Casey surprised everyone: Justices Anthony Kennedy, Sandra Day OConnor and David Souter co-authored an opinion that upheld the core holding of Roe but gave states more leeway to regulate abortion through informed consent requirements, waiting periods and other barriers. Instead of the strict scrutiny that doomed most restrictions under Roe, a more pliable undue burden standard would apply to abortion regulations.  Activists on both sides condemned the ruling, but Casey included something for everyone. The decision placed abortion rights on firmer constitutional footing by grounding them in womens dignity and equality. Women, the court said, needed reproductive choice to determine their individual destinies and to participate fully in the economic and social life of the nation. At the same time, Casey upheld states interest in protecting potential life, approving all but one of the challenged Pennsylvania regulations. As abortion-rights leaders feared, Caseys undue burden standard allowed more restrictions than Roe. Many states have enacted laws that drastically limit access to reproductive health care, particularly for poor, rural and immigrant women who cannot afford to miss work and make repeated trips to clinics hundreds of miles away. But in 2016, Justice Kennedy provided the crucial vote to strike down, under Casey, a Texas law that shuttered half the states clinics by imposing excessively burdensome requirements on them.  For anti-abortion activists, Casey confirmed the paramount importance of judicial appointments. Caseys co-authors were all Republican appointees. Anti-abortion conservatives vowed that never again would they allow a Republican president to squander Supreme Court nominations on unreliable judges.  Abortion opponents, like their adversaries, recognize the potential for electoral backlash if the court reverses Roe outright. Many would prefer abortion rights to die gradually and quietly. Merely by interpreting Casey to allow increasingly restrictive laws, the Supreme Court can stealthily smother choice without appearing to deliver a death blow. Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, said this summer that she could not support a nominee who had demonstrated hostility to Roe or to established precedent. Judge Kavanaugh reportedly told Ms. Collins recently that he considered Roe to be settled law. These statements should reassure no one. Casey, not Roe, is the established precedent that matters here. And it seems more likely that abortion rights will die a death by a thousand cuts through restrictive state laws allowed under Casey than by a reversal of Roe. Either way, a vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to diminish reproductive freedom.  It is also a vote to advance a larger agenda. Over several decades, the conservative legal movement has linked opposition to reproductive choice with constitutional theories that enhance the rights of corporations at the expense of human beings. Conservatives have tethered the anti-abortion cause to a selective libertarianism that opposes government regulation of business but authorizes expansive executive power and state intrusion on individual liberties. Judge Kavanaugh would not have passed Federalist Society muster if he did not demonstrate allegiance to these principles. With this confirmation vote, then, much more than abortion rights hangs in the balance. So does the countrys ability to fight voter suppression, political corruption and racial intimidation; to protect clean air and water; to ensure safety for workers and consumers; to combat climate change; to enact sensible gun laws; to voluntarily integrate public schools; to provide necessary health care and preserve a basic social safety net; to protect civil rights and liberties; and to safeguard the integrity of all families.  Americans who put aside their qualms and voted for the president to secure Supreme Court justices who would end legal abortion may pay a high price for their choice. With one more justice, Mr. Trumps Republican Party will fully control all three branches of government, eliminating the last check on his power. It matters little, therefore, what Judge Kavanaugh says to senators about Roe or settled law. Conservatives have learned the lessons of Casey too well to permit the appointment of another justice in the Anthony Kennedy mold. And abortion rights are one of many inevitable casualties of this appointment. Senators who vote yes will bear responsibility for all of them.

At least nine deaths were reported as Typhoon Jebi made landfall in southern Japan early Tuesday afternoon. The typhoon, with winds up to 130 miles (209 kilometers) per hour, prompted officials to urge the evacuation of more than a million people. The typhoon comes during a summer plagued with weather issues, including lethal floods and landslides and deadly heat waves. _____  Outsourced jobs, sure. But outsourced pollution? Wealthy countries have been outsourcing a big chunk of their carbon emissions abroad. Theyve done this by importing more steel, cement and goods from factories in China and other countries, rather than producing them domestically. A new report on the global carbon trade estimates that 25 percent of the worlds total emissions are now being outsourced this way.

Will it matter? By Michelle Goldberg Opinion Columnist Obviously, I believe Christine Blasey Ford, the psychology professor who says that Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her in high school while his friend Mark Judge watched and, at moments, egged him on. I believe her when she says that Kavanaugh, who she says was drunk, held her down, covered her mouth when she tried to scream, and ground against her while attempting to pull her clothes off. I believe her when she says this incident haunted her all her life. Theres rarely hard evidence in a case like this, but Blasey  the surname she prefers to use publicly  has done everything possible to substantiate her claim. Speaking to The Washington Post, she produced notes from a therapist she saw in 2012, whom shed told about being attacked by students from an elitist boys school who grew up to become high-ranking members of society in Washington. According to her husband, that year she identified Kavanaugh to him by name. When Kavanaugh appeared on a shortlist of potential Supreme Court picks  but before his nomination had been announced  Blasey contacted both The Post and her member of Congress, Anna G. Eshoo of California. By all indications, she wanted to head his nomination off without being forced into the spotlight. Blasey passed a polygraph administered by a former F.B.I. agent. The utility of polygraphs is dubious, but her willingness to take one is evidence of her sincerity. According to Axios, some Republicans wanted to call on Blasey to testify publicly, assuming shed decline. But on Monday morning, Blaseys lawyer, Debra Katz, said that her client is willing to appear before Congress. Kavanaugh denies the allegation unequivocally; on Monday he said hes willing to rebut it before the Senate Judiciary Committee. (Judge, who wrote a memoir of his teenage alcoholism, has veered between denying the incident and saying he doesnt recall it.) But its a sign of how credible Blasey seems that, since this story broke, much of the public debate has been less about whether her accusations are true than whether they are relevant. Some conservatives  though not just conservatives  insist that it is unfair to judge a middle-aged man for things he did as a kid. On Fox News, the former George W. Bush press secretary Ari Fleischer pondered the weight of high school misbehavior. Should that deny us chances later in life? he asked. Even for Supreme Court job, a presidency of the United States, or you name it? Such arguments would be more convincing if people on the right werent so selective in their indulgence. Donald Trump called for the death penalty for the Central Park Five, who were 14 to 16 years old when they were arrested. (Theyve since been proven innocent.) Children are regularly put on sex offender registries, sometimes for their entire lives, for conduct less serious than what Kavanaugh is accused of. In a sour irony, some legal experts think Kavanaughs confirmation could imperil Miller v. Alabama, a 2012 decision banning life sentences without parole for most teenage convicts. Anyway, this is no longer just about what Kavanaugh might have done 36 years ago. We need to determine, as best we can, if hes lying now. The Judiciary Committee will be able to begin trying to do that at a public hearing next Monday  called by the committee's head, Charles Grassley, under pressure from some members of his own party. Senators should also demand that Kavanaughs old friend Judge, who grew up to become a right-wing writer, testify, though Kavanaugh would surely prefer other character witnesses. (Oh for the days when President George W. Bush gave his wife, Laura, a loving but firm pat on the backside in public, Judge once wrote. The man knew who was boss.) There is a small, dark part of me that thinks it would be fitting if Republicans shove Kavanaugh through despite the allegations against him. Anyone Trump nominates is going to threaten Roe v. Wade. Kavanaugh would at least make plain the power dynamics behind forced pregnancy. We would lose Roe because a president who boasted of sexual assault, elected against the wishes of the majority of female voters, was able to give a lifetime Supreme Court appointment to an ex-frat boy credibly accused of attempted rape. Kavanaugh, helped by an all-male Republican caucus on the Judiciary Committee, would join Clarence Thomas, whose confirmation hearing helped make the phrase sexual harassment a household term. They and three other men would likely vote against the courts three women. The brute imposition of patriarchy would be undeniable. If the Kavanaugh nomination is scuttled, chances are Republicans will try to replace him with someone like Amy Coney Barrett, who is in some ways more conservative. She would put a softer, female face on the culture war. But thats a fight for another day. On Sunday, Politico quoted a lawyer close to the White House as saying that the administration had redoubled its support for Kavanaugh in light of Blaseys claims: If somebody can be brought down by accusations like this, then you, me, every man certainly should be worried. If the Kavanaugh nomination goes forward, its because Trump and his allies believe that a certain class of men accused of sexual assault deserve impunity. The question now is whether any Republican senators believe otherwise. Michelle Goldberg has been an Opinion columnist since 2017. She is the author of several books about politics, religion and womens rights, and was part of a team that won a Pulitzer Prize for public service in 2018 for reporting on workplace sexual harassment issues.  @michelleinbklyn  Advertisement",Boys Will Be Supreme Court Justices,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/17/opinion/columnists/christine-blasey-ford-brett-kavanaugh-supreme-court-republicans.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/17/opinion/17goldbergWeb/17goldbergWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg,4

Heres the sign-up.) Good morning. Heres what you need to know: Judge Brett Kavanaugh, appearing on Fox News on Monday night, declared that he would not withdraw from consideration for the Supreme Court, vowing to fight what he called smears, after two women accused him of sexual impropriety. Joined by his wife, Ashley Estes Kavanaugh, the judge addressed the accusation by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, who says he assaulted her when they were teenagers: The truth is Ive never sexually assaulted anyone, in high school or otherwise, he said. He and Dr. Blasey are scheduled to testify on Thursday before the Senate Judiciary Committee.  The interview: It was the first time in memory that a Supreme Court nominee submitted to a TV interview before the confirmation vote. Read  excerpts from a transcript.  The politics: Democrats are hoping to defeat Judge Kavanaughs nomination and to win control of the Senate in November. Doing so would enable them to block President Trumps future Supreme Court nominations.  The yearbook: Judge Kavanaugh and some of his friends described themselves in Georgetown Preparatory Schools 1983 yearbook as Renate alumni. Renate Schroeder Dolphin, the woman they were referring to, is furious. President Trump, who is in New York for the annual session of the U.N. General Assembly, said he would meet on Thursday with his deputy attorney general, after much of Washington  including Mr. Rosenstein himself  was convinced that he would be fired on Monday. The drama unfolded after The Times reported last week that Mr. Rosenstein had considered secretly taping the president and had discussed using the 25th Amendment to remove him from office. Mr. Rosenstein called the report inaccurate.  Whats at stake: As the top Justice Department official overseeing the investigation by Robert Mueller, the special counsel, Mr. Rosenstein has long been a target of Mr. Trumps complaints. Mr. Rosenstein has repeatedly backed Mr. Mueller. The annual meeting of the General Assembly opened in New York City on Monday against a backdrop of turmoil for President Trump, who was asked almost immediately about the accusations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh. The president called them totally political. Later, an announcement by Mr. Trump about talks with North Korea was quickly overshadowed by questions about his deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein. The president is scheduled to address the U.N. today. Here are the latest updates.  Iran nuclear talks: President Hassan Rouhani, in New York for the meetings, said he would reopen nuclear talks with Washington only if Mr. Trump reversed his decision to back out of the 2015 deal.  In Moscow: As tensions with Israel escalate, Russia announced that it would supply Syria with an advanced air missile system. Doing so could increase the risks of an air war there. Mike Krieger and Kevin Systrom, who started the photo-sharing app in 2010, resigned on Monday and plan to leave in the coming weeks. They didnt give a reason for stepping down, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter, but plan to take time off. Facebook bought Instagram in 2012 for $1 billion, and it has been one of the social media companys most successful acquisitions. At the time of the deal, the app had about 30 million users, a number that has since ballooned to more than a billion.  Why it matters: The founders departures create uncertainty at a time when Facebook faces some of the biggest crises of its 14-year history. Prosecutors have asked that the disgraced entertainer be handed the maximum prison term possible: 10 years. (He had faced a sentence of up to 30 years, but on Monday, Judge Steven ONeill merged the three counts of aggravated indecent assault he was convicted of into one.)

What were reading Michael Roston, an editor for our Science section, recommends this article in GQ: A community of wealthy Americans who dont want to pay their federal income taxes has found a haven in Puerto Rico. This offers a very interesting look at where and how they live. William Faulkner, born on this day in 1897 in New Albany, Miss., won two Pulitzers and the Nobel Prize in Literature. His Southern-rooted fiction, heartbreaking, dark and perverse, is often remembered for its long, winding sentences. His work appears in almost every listing of the best American novels. Whats less known about Faulkner is that he was a devotee of mysteries  Agatha Christie, Dashiell Hammett, Dorothy L. Sayers  and that he tried his hand at the genre. In 1946, he won second prize in the annual Ellery Queen Mystery Magazine contest, for the story An Error in Chemistry. (Its big reveal involved a whiskey toddy). The story later appeared in Knights Gambit, a mystery collection by Faulkner featuring a mild-mannered yet shrewd country lawyer from Mississippi. Reviews were mixed, but The Times gave it a thumbs up. Faulkner rarely discussed his love of mysteries, perhaps considering them lowbrow, but he seemed to understand their importance to his writing. A friend recalled visiting a library with him, so Faulkner could exchange a stack of mystery stories for a new stack. I asked him, Why do you read all of these damn mysteries? and he said, Bud, no matter what you write, its a mystery of one kind or another.

Developing: The American Bar Association called for postponing a vote on Judge Kavanaugh until after an F.B.I. investigation. At nearly nine hours, Thursdays hearing was a political drama that doubled as a reality show, our media correspondent writes. It was an interrogation of gender, class and power in #MeToo America.

What were reading Albert Sun, an assistant editor, recommends this piece from The Guardian: TripAdvisor has grown into one of the giants of the travel industry, with reviews, information and simple scores about seemingly the whole world. This long read dives deep into how the company, which has grabbed a $7 billion piece of the reputation economy, has found itself struggling with fake reviews, litigious business owners and  in common with other tech giants  the difficulty of becoming an arbiter of truth. Appointed in 1791 to design what would become the city of Washington, Pierre LEnfant was said to have been inspired by the gardens at the royal palace of Versailles, in his homeland, France. As part of his plan for the federal city, he envisioned a great church for national purposes. The final stone at the Washington National Cathedral was placed almost 200 years later, on Sept. 29, 1990, 83 years after the buildings foundation stone was dedicated by President Theodore Roosevelt. The cathedral is the sixth largest in the world and has been the site of state funerals for three presidents: Dwight Eisenhower, Ronald Reagan and Gerald Ford. The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his final Sunday sermon there, four days before he was assassinated in 1968. The gothic building features more than 100 gargoyles (including one of the Star Wars baddie Darth Vader) and more than 200 stained-glass windows, one of which contains a piece of lunar rock. Speaking at the dedication ceremony in 1990, President George H.W. Bush noted that the cathedral, which does not receive direct federal funding, was built with the gifts of the people who were its congregation: the millions across America.
