 With Brett Kavanaughs Supreme Court confirmation hearings set to begin next week, I am reminded of a pro bono matter that Brett Kavanaugh and I worked on years ago that exemplifies his commitment to protecting Americans freedom of religion  no matter their faith. In 1999, a group of residents in West Bethesda, Md., sued to block construction of Temple Adat Shalom, a Reconstructionist synagogue, in their neighborhood. The neighbors stated objection was that the size of the synagogue would mar the character of the neighborhood. The essence of their challenge was that the portion of the Montgomery County Code that deems places of worship a permitted use  and therefore exempts them from the onerous requirement of obtaining a special exception to the zoning laws  violated the Establishment Clause of the U.S. Constitution. I was a young partner in the Washington, D.C., office of Kirkland & Ellis and had been involved in several religious-freedom cases, so I wasnt surprised when the synagogue asked me to represent them pro bono. I asked another young partner at the firm, Brett Kavanaugh, to join me. I turned to Brett because I knew him to have the same deep respect for religion that I have. And though he is Catholic and I am an observant Jew, we shared a commitment to upholding the religion prongs of the First Amendment  the Establishment Clause and the Free Exercise Clause  and seeing that they were properly interpreted and enforced. I also knew that Brett shared my commitment to pro bono work. Pro bono legal work sometimes creates strange bedfellows, and this case was no exception. The point person for the congregation was Matt Nosanchuk, who later became President Obamas liaison to the Jewish community and associate director of the White House Office of Public Engagement. Despite our political differences, Brett and I found common ground with Matt on the issues in the case. We realized that Adat Shalom was simply the victim of a Not in My Backyard campaign; the allegation that the zoning code violated the federal Constitution was totally baseless. The essence of our defense was that the Maryland law was neutral as to religion and therefore could not be construed as favoring or establishing religion. Indeed, while the law granted an exemption from the zoning process for churches, memorial gardens, monasteries, and other places of worship, it extended the same benefit to plainly non-religious facilities such as museums, libraries, and farmers markets. Judge Andre Davis  a Clinton appointee who later was elevated to the Fourth Circuit by President Obama  agreed with us and dismissed the complaint, finding that the challenged law had a valid secular purpose and achieves genuine neutrality toward religion. The sensitivity and professionalism that Brett brought to the Adat Shalom case have always been his hallmarks. I had the pleasure of working together with Brett on other matters in private practice and again when we were colleagues in the White House. Brett combines great intellect with superb judgment and equanimity. Even when we were working on the most serious issues in the White House and encountered challenging situations, I never saw Brett lose his composure. He always treated his colleagues with respect. In the years since Brett became a federal judge, I have argued before him in two complex administrative-law cases. Despite a full docket, he is always intimately familiar with the record in each case and the relevant case law. And though I admit to being happy with the outcome only in one of the two lawsuits (he ruled against me in the other), I cant think of any federal judge before whom I have argued who is better prepared for oral argument than Judge Kavanaugh. Brett Kavanaugh has the qualities we most admire and seek in judges. He is smart, thoughtful, impartial, discreet, empathetic, and principled. If confirmed as an associate justice of the United States, he would continue to be a vigorous defender of the Constitution.

              Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh is declining to answer questions about the extent of the president's pardon power. (Sept. 5)
             WASHINGTON (AP)  Pressured by Democrats with Donald Trump on their minds, Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh rejected repeated requests at Wednesday's Senate confirmation hearing to reveal his views about a president pardoning himself or being forced to testify in a criminal case. For a second day, the judge nominated by Trump insisted he fully embraced the importance of judicial independence. But he refused to provide direct answers to Democrats who wanted him to say whether there are limits on a president's power to issue pardons, including to himself or in exchange for a bribe. He also would not say whether he believes the president can be subpoenaed to testify. ""I'm not going to answer hypothetical questions of that sort,"" Kavanaugh said in response to a question from Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont about pardons. Still, he began his long day in the witness chair by declaring that ""no one is above the law."" The Senate Judiciary Committee hearing has strong political overtones ahead of the November congressional elections, but as a practical matter Democrats lack the votes to block Kavanaugh's confirmation. Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh declines to answer questions about the extent of the president's pardon power, on Sept. 5, 2018. (AP video) They are concerned that Kavanaugh will push the court to the right on abortion, guns and other issues, and that he will side with President Trump in cases stemming from special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election and possible ties to the Trump campaign. The 53-year-old appellate judge answered cautiously when asked about most of those matters, refusing an invitation from Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut to pledge to step aside from any Supreme Court cases dealing with Trump and Mueller's investigation. Kavanaugh's most uncomfortable moment may have come near the end of nearly 12 hours in the witness chair, when Democratic Sen. Kamala Harris asked whether he had discussed the investigation with anyone at a law firm founded by Marc Kasowitz, a onetime lawyer for Trump. Kavanaugh said he couldn't recall any conversations, but asked for a list of lawyers at the firm. Harris said she thought Kavanaugh had a name in mind but did not want to reveal it. She promised to follow up, amid Republican complaints that she was being unfair. Protesters continued their efforts to interrupt the hearings, but senators basically ignored their shouts as they were removed by police. U.S. Capitol Police said 66 people were removed from the committee room Wednesday and charged with disorderly conduct. Six more at a different Senate office building were charged with crowding, obstructing or incommoding.

(AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin) Democrats also persisted with their complaints that they were being denied access to records from Kavanaugh's time in the George W. Bush White House. One TV viewer gave Kavanaugh a rave review. Trump said he had been watching the hearings and thought the Democrats were ""grasping at straws"" in questioning the man he chose to replace retired Justice Anthony Kennedy. He said he ""saw some incredible answers to very complex questions."" The committee's top Democrat, Dianne Feinstein of California, disagreed. ""He's not being very specific,"" she said during a break in the proceedings. The Democrats weren't the only ones who recognized the importance of questions about Trump and the Russia investigation. Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, asked Kavanaugh right away whether he would be independent from the president who chose him for highly prestigious lifetime position. Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, listens as Trump's Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, is questioned by the committee on Capitol Hill in Washington, Wednesday, Sept. 5, 2018, on the second day of Kavanaugh's confirmation hearing to replace retired Justice Anthony Kennedy. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin) Kavanaugh said, ""The first thing that makes a good judge is independence, not being swayed by political or public pressure."" He cited historic cases, including the Brown v. Board of Education ruling that desegregated schools and the U.S. v. Nixon decision that compelled the president to turn over the Watergate tapes  a ruling Kavanaugh had previously questioned. ""That takes some backbone,"" he said of the justices who decided those cases. But when asked more specific questions, including whether a president can be required to respond to a subpoena, Kavanaugh said, ""I can't give you an answer on that hypothetical question."" The Supreme Court has never answered that question, and it is among the potentially most important since Trump could face a subpoena from special counsel Mueller. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat, asked whether a president could be criminally investigated or indicted. Kavanaugh again said he had never taken a position on those issues, though he did write in a 1998 article that impeachment may be the only way to hold a president accountable while in office. ""The Constitution itself seems to dictate, in addition, that congressional investigation must take place in lieu of criminal investigation when the President is the subject of investigation, and that criminal prosecution can occur only after the President has left office,"" he wrote in the Georgetown Law Review. On abortion, Kavanaugh wouldn't say whether the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that ensures access to abortion was correct, but noted it has been affirmed ""many times."" ""Respect for precedent is important. ... Precedent is rooted right in the Constitution itself,"" he said. Kavanaugh likened Roe v. Wade to another controversial, landmark Supreme Court decision, the Miranda ruling about the rights of criminal suspects. Kavanaugh said the court specifically reaffirmed both decisions in later cases that made them ""precedent on precedent."" Kavanaugh defended his dissenting opinion last year in the case of a pregnant immigrant teen in federal custody. Kavanaugh would have denied her immediate access to an abortion, even after she received permission from a Texas judge. Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, praised Kavanaugh for hiring female lawyers as clerks as a judge on the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, and then posed questions about whether Kavanaugh was aware of sexual harassment allegations against retired circuit court Judge Alex Kozinski in California. Kavanaugh considered the judge a friend and mentor and Kozinski testified at Kavanaugh's 2006 confirmation hearing to be an appellate judge. Kavanaugh said he had known nothing about the allegations until they were disclosed last year. ""It was a gut punch for me,"" he said, and he was ""shocked, disappointed, angry."" Asked about an email list Kozinski allegedly used to send offensive material, Kavanaugh said, ""I don't remember anything like that."" The judge's work in the Bush White House also has figured in the hearing, particularly as Democratic senators have fought for access to documents from his three years as staff secretary. They say those could shed light on his views about policies from that era, including the detention and interrogation of terror suspects. Majority Republicans have declined to seek the papers, and instead have gathered documents from his work as White House counsel to Bush. Many are being held as confidential within the committee. Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., questions Trump's Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington, Wednesday, Sept. 5, 2018, on the second day of Kavanaugh's confirmation hearing to replace retired Justice Anthony Kennedy. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin) Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois asked Kavanaugh if he would seek a delay in his hearing so the paper trail could be vetted. But Kavanaugh declined to engage, saying, ""I do not believe that's consistent"" with the way prior nominations have been handled. Kavanaugh stood by his 2006 testimony, when he was nominated for the appellate court, when he said he was not involved in some Bush-era policies, particularly a bill-signing statement on the treatment of terror suspects that would have passed his desk as staff secretary. Kavanaugh said his earlier testimony was ""100 percent accurate."" Republicans hope to confirm Kavanaugh in time for the first day of the new Supreme Court term, Oct. 1. They now have a 51-49 majority in the Senate, after Jon Kyl was sworn in Wednesday to fill the seat held by the late Sen. John McCain of Arizona. One of several Democrats who could potentially vote for Kavanaugh, Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, joined the hearing in the audience for a while. He is up for re-election this fall in a state Trump won handily in 2016. Independent Sen. Angus King of Maine also stopped in for part of the session. ___ Associated Press writer Jessica Gresko contributed to this report. ___ Read more on AP's coverage of Kavanaugh at https://apnews.com/tag/Kavanaughnomination",DAY 2...,https://www.apnews.com/100eb6907ece4f02a53b6ccfcda99649,https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/media/media:0b85e6977e8b45ba810afaae82eedc20/800.jpeg,center

 There is certainly an honorable way to oppose the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh. Its simple. A progressive senator can simply declare that he or she does not agree with Kavanaughs judicial philosophy, explain why, and vote against him. There is no constitutional rule that declares a senator must vote for every qualified Supreme Court nominee. Theres also an honorable way to investigate Kavanaughs fitness for the bench, regardless of his judicial philosophy. A judge at any level  much less the Supreme Court  should exhibit a basic and enduring commitment to honesty and integrity. So, yes, scrutinize his record. Diligently investigate his background. If a serious character issue emerges, expose it. But its low and dishonorable to skip the principled opposition and simply smear a good man, engaging in cheap character assassination as Judge Kavanaughs Democratic opponents have this week. For those keeping score at home, millions of Americans have now been exposed to false and ridiculous claims that Kavanaugh is a slippery perjurer who surrounds himself with racists and a cold, dark soul who deliberately snubbed a murdered childs father. The latter two claims date back to the first day of his hearing, when the online Left erupted with claims that former Kavanaugh clerk Zina Bash had flashed a white-power symbol during the hearing. It turns out that Bash is a Mexican-American immigrant with a Jewish father, a descendant of Holocaust survivors. So, no, shes not a white nationalist. The same day, activists claimed that Kavanaugh actively refused to shake Fred Guttenbergs hand. Guttenberg is the father of a student murdered in Februarys Parkland, Fla. school shooting, and he approached Kavanaugh in the scrum following a break in the hearing. Just as Guttenberg, a complete stranger to Kavanaugh, stuck out his hand, security arrived and ushered Kavanaugh away. This was then cravenly spun into an outrage by the progressive Internet. Then there are the perjury claims. Writing in the widely read online journal, Above the Law, writer Elie Mystal charged that Kavanaugh committed perjury when, during the 2004 hearing from which he was confirmed to the D.C. Circuit court of appeals, he told Ted Kennedy that he was not involved in Bill Pryors nomination to the Eleventh Circuit. In fact, Mystal said, He was involved. In documents made public during Senator Pat Leahys questioning, Kavanaugh is shown to have recommended Pryor, and invited to actively discuss Pyrors hearings. As proof of the alleged lie, Mystal embedded this tweet: On the left, sworn testimony in which Brett Kavanaugh tells Ted Kennedy he was ""not involved in handling"" Bill Pryor's nomination.  On the right, Brett Kavanaugh is invited to an ""emergency umbrella meeting"" at a private law firm ""to discuss nominee Bill Pryor's hearing."" pic.twitter.com/IDff00xEwm  southpaw (@nycsouthpaw) September 6, 2018  With a dramatic flair, he then declared, This. Is. Perjury, before adding an ominous warning: If Kavanaugh is confirmed, the Democrats will now have grounds to call for his impeachment every single day for the literal rest of his natural life. He perjured himself before Congress. We now have more on him than we had on Bill Clinton. Shocking stuff. Or not. In an extended Twitter thread, the founder and former managing editor of Above the Law, David Lat, thoroughly dismantled Mystals claim. It turns out that Kavanaughs testimony was far more extensive than the single sentence Mystal cited. Given the full context, once can clearly see that Kavanaugh was telling the truth. As Lat explains, different lawyers in the White House counsels office were assigned different circuits as their portfolio. Kavanaugh explained at his hearing that he was not assigned the Pryor nomination  so he wasnt handling Pryors confirmation. But, even then, Kavanaugh said in his testimony that he participated in the process: 8. Kavanaugh explicitly ADMITTED, for example, that he might have attended a moot session for Pryor, and/or read & discussed news articles about the Pryor nom (but understandably didn't want to go into detail about @WhiteHouse internal deliberations). pic.twitter.com/K9nOo4uf2X  David Lat (@DavidLat) September 6, 2018  So, in context, the meaning is plain: The Pryor nomination wasnt his to handle, but he did assist in some ways. Its right there, in black and white. Perjury? Not by a long shot. Writing in Slate, Lisa Graves also claimed that Kavanaugh should be impeached, not elevated for supposedly perjuring himself. She argued that the judge deliberately lied when he testified he did not see any information stolen from Democrats by former GOP Senate aide Manuel Miranda in the early 2000s. Heres the relevant portion of Kavanaughs testimony: I dont know what the universe of memos might be, but I do know that I never received any memos, was not aware of any such memos. Graves claimed that Kavanaugh actually did receive information she believes plainly came from stolen Democratic talking points. Perjury, right? Not so fast. Even a panel of experts convened by Vox threw cold water on Gravess legal theory. There is a long distance between an inaccurate statement and the kind of willful, deliberate falsehood that constitutes a federal crime. Brooklyn law professor Miriam Baer said that she didnt see any lie in Kavanaughs response. He simply testified that he didnt realize the material was stolen. All of these claims raise a simple question: Why? Why did so many people  often egged on by informed partisans who shouldve known better  immediately rush to believe the worst about Kavanaughs character and motives? There are people who think the ends justify the means, and it is just fine to destroy a mans good name to keep him off the High Court by spreading falsehoods. So, yes, malice is part of the explanation, but its only part. In my experience most partisans arent intentionally malicious. Rather they believe Kavanaughs philosophy is ipso facto proof of his low character. They look at a person who may overturn Roe, who voted to overturn Washington D.C.s assault-weapons ban, and who has written opinions that they believe empower religious bigots, and they think, This is a bad man. Thus, when they see a former clerk make an Ok sign, or watch Kavanaugh turn away when a Parkland father extends his hand, or listen to his testimony, they immediately interpret each experience through the prism of their distaste. Thats negative polarization at work. You see it all the time. The very idea that Kavanaugh was appointed by Trump means that hes lost the benefit of the doubt. The very notion that he thinks the original public meaning of the Constitution may not include federal protection for a right to an abortion means that he hates women. Heck, even originalism itself (in the telling of the truly blinded activist) is believed to be a ruse  a philosophical disguise for naked partisanship and outright bigotry. In other words, in their minds, theyre not engaging in character assassination so much as character revelation. Its sad that this is news to some, but people of good faith and high character can and do come to competing conclusions about originalism, abortion, gun control, and religious liberty. Evidence of opposition is not, by itself, evidence of evil, and we would be well-served by ceasing to pretend that it is. There is overwhelming evidence that Brett Kavanaugh is a good and intelligent man who is a faithful adherent to a particular judicial philosophy. You can honorably oppose that philosophy, but you cannot honorably smear the man.

 Brett Kavanaugh will make an outstanding Supreme Court justice, in part because he actually wants the job. That is, he refuses to cede his judicial responsibilities to the encroaching administrative state. The role of an Article III judge is limited but important: A judge interprets the Constitution, and the laws passed by Congress, to decide cases presented to the court. As Chief Justice Marshall famously said in Marbury, It is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is. Judge Kavanaugh has taken that duty seriously on the D.C. Circuit. During his twelve years on the bench, he has unwaveringly held executive agencies to the laws set by Congress and the Constitution. Judge Kavanaugh knows that it is the judiciary, not the executive, that has the power to say what the law is. And he knows that it is the judiciary, not the executive, that has the power to hear cases and controversies. Separating power between Congress, the executive branch, and the judiciary can cause inconvenience. Turning decision-making over to technocratic elites can be alluring. But haste also makes waste. Moreover, as the Supreme Court noted in Chadha, convenience and efficiency are not the primary objectives  or the hallmarks  of democratic government. The constitutional requirements of bicameralism and presentment, which requires a bill to pass through both houses of Congress and cross the presidents desk before it can be a law,are pointless if a bureaucrat can stretch Congresss law into loopholes large enough to sneak through policies untouched by the political process. And this is where Judge Kavanaugh comes in. Laws written in general language must be interpreted to apply to individual circumstances. Just as a judge asks whether a statute protects or prohibits certain behavior, an agency must interpret a statute to determine whether it permits certain agency action. But, as Judge Kavanaugh understands, a judge and an agency have different objectives: A judge seeks the best reading of the statute; an agency seeks the reading of the statute that best comports with its policy goals. Under Chevron, the Supreme Courts invented deference doctrine, courts defer to whatever interpretation an agency comes up with so long as that interpretation is reasonable. Judge Kavanaugh has rightly criticized this doctrine as giving agencies too much power to stretch the meaning of statutes enacted by Congress to accommodate their preferred policy outcomes. Under Chevron, Judge Kavanaugh has observed, executive branch agencies often think they can take a particular action unless it is clearly forbidden  rather than seeking to conform the action to the law. And when it comes to holding agencies accountable, Judge Kavanaugh has put his money where his mouth is. For example, in Loving v. IRS, he rebuffed an attempt by the IRSto force small-time tax-preparers to pay fees, pass exams, and enroll in government training programs usinga lawthatauthorizesthe agency to regulate professionals who represent clients in IRS proceedings. As Judge Kavanaugh explained, the statute at issue said nothing about people who help individuals prepare their tax returns, and so the court vacated the rule as a vast expansion of the IRSs authority. Judge Kavanaugh has also scolded agencies for skimping on due-process rights in agency proceedings. In particular, deciding the rights of individuals without a fair hearing and on bureaucracy standard time does not sit well with the judge. When the SEC denied a defendants request in Laccetti v. SECto have an expert accompany him to an investigative interview, Judge Kavanaugh chastised the agency for violating its own fair procedures rule. In a dissent to Lorenzo v. SEC, Judge Kavanaugh chewed out the agency for imposing a lifetime suspension on a banker who forwarded an email from his boss to his clients that turned out to contain false information. According to Judge Kavanaugh, the SEC contravene[d] basic due process by failing to consider the bankers state of mind when he forwarded the emails. And then, instead of correcting the mistake on review, the agency rewrote the administrative law judges factual findings to make those factual findings correspond to the legal conclusion that [the banker] was guilty. As Judge Kavanaugh put it, So much for a fair trial. His dissent prompted the Supreme Court to grant cert to review the agencys behavior. Democrats have tried to characterize Judge Kavanaugh as radical, but whats actually radical is the way that misguided deference doctrines have amplified agency power and choked the judiciarys constitutional role. Judge Kavanaugh just wants to do his job: He wants to interpret the law and preserve due process. Thats why we need him on the Court, and why I will do everything in my power to see him confirmed.

The Texas Republican asked Kavanaugh about a 2015 case, Priests for Life v. HHS, in which Priests for Life sued the federal government for relief from the Health and Human Services Departments Obamacare mandate, which required that employers subsidize contraception  including emergency contraception  for employees. When Cruz asked him to describe the facts of the case, Kavanaugh articulated the argument of the plaintiff, Priests for Life: They said filling out the form would make them complicit in the provision of the abortion-inducing drugs that they were, as a religious matter, objected to. Immediately, pro-abortion interest groups such as NARAL, Planned Parenthood, and the Center for Reproductive Rights latched onto Kavanaughs remark, accusing him of spreading anti-science, anti-woman propaganda by equating birth control with abortion-inducing drugs. In fact, the judge was merely restating the plaintiffs argument about emergency contraception, not stating his personal opinion. The office of Senator Kamala Harris (D., Calif.) deceptively edited the video clip to make it appear as if Kavanaugh was stating his own view rather than reiterating the position of the plaintiff. CNN, among other mainstream outlets, took this lie and ran with it as well. Aside from the outright maliciousness of these lies about Kavanaughs remarks during the hearing, though, its worth noting that, far from being anti-science, anti-woman propaganda, Priests for Lifes assessment is correct. Emergency contraception sometimes does induce abortion. NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis. In Priests for Life, the plaintiffs argument accurately paraphrased the Food and Drug Administration label for ellaOne, a common emergency contraceptive, which itself states that it might prevent the implantation of a conceived embryo, thus causing its death. (Copper intrauterine devices have been shown to occasionally do the same.) While there are pills explicitly marketed to induce early abortions (RU-486, for example), and Plan-B and ellaOne are not such pills, all three drugs are progesterone blockers and function similarly. As a result, emergency contraceptives can have an abortifacient effect if taken after an embryo has already been conceived by preventing implantation in the uterine lining. To avoid this inconvenient, scientific reality, abortion-rights activists and their allies in the medical profession have systematically redefined pregnancy to mean the implantation of an embryo in the uterine lining rather than the conception of an embryo with its fully unique, human DNA. As a result of this neat semantic trick, any drug that prevents the implantation of an existing embryois said to prevent pregnancyrather than aborting an existing one. These rhetorical sleights of hand aside, the fact is that these emergency contraceptive methodscan cause embryonic death  i.e. they can be abortion-inducing.

I know the ABA has a rather shaky reputation, but please hear me out before dismissing this rating out-of-hand. The ABA has been rating prospective appointees to U.S. District Courts, U.S. Courts of Appeals, and the U.S. Supreme Court since the early 1950s. For many years, as an August 1988 Washington Post editorial put it, the ABA had a virtual veto power before a nomination is made. A not qualifiedABA rating routinely prevented nomination by the president. A not qualified rating is no longer the kiss of death. Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, for example, nominated twelve individuals to the federal bench whom the ABA rated not qualified. Eight of them were approved with no opposition by the Judiciary Committee and confirmed by the full Senate with a combined total of one  just one  negative vote. Three of the four nominees by President Trump who were rated not qualified have been confirmed by the Senate, two without any opposition. More troubling is that several studies have actually demonstrated that the ABAs ratings are, in fact, biased against Republican nominees. In 2001, Professor James Lindgren at Northwestern University Law School examined ABA ratings for nominees to the U.S. Court of Appeals by Presidents George H. W. Bush and Clinton. Controlling for several objective credentials, Lindgren found that, for nominees without prior judicial experience, Clinton nominees were nearly ten times more likely than Bush nominees to be rated as well qualified. Also in 2001, the Journal of Law & Politics published a study of this subject by John Lott of the American Enterprise Institute. Lott supplemented Lindgrens measures of professional competence and also found that being a Clinton nominee significantly raises the probability that someone will be given a well-qualified recommendation from the ABA. NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis. In 2009, three political scientists addressed this issue, publishing their findings in Political Research Quarterly. These scholars used two different models; each showed bias in favor of Democratic judicial nominees. Moreover, they found, this bias was especially pronounced in the likelihood that a nominee would be rated well qualified. John Lott, now with the University of Maryland, revisited this subject in 2013. Using a larger data set, he again found that the ABA systematically giv[es] lower ratings to Republican circuit court nominees. This history of controversy over the ABAs ratings, validated by studies showing systematic and even dramatic bias against Republican nominees, might counsel dismissing anything the ABA has to say. But, in a somewhat unusual way, it actually makes the ABAs rating of Kavanaugh even more meaningful. The ABA unanimously gave Kavanaugh its highest well qualified rating. Its published criteria explain what this means for a Supreme Court nominee: A Supreme Court nominee should possess an especially high degree of legal scholarship, academic talent, analytical and writing abilities, and overall excellence. The ability to write clearly and persuasively, to harmonize a body of law, and to give meaningful guidance to trial courts, circuit courts and the bar for future cases are particularly important skills for a Supreme Court nominee. . . . To merit the Committees rating of Well Qualified, a Supreme Court nominee must be a preeminent member of the legal profession, have outstanding legal ability and exceptional breadth of experience, and meet the very highest standards of integrity, professional competence and judicial temperament. The rating of Well Qualified is reserved for those found to merit the Committees strongest affirmative endorsement. If Kavanaugh, nominated by a Republican president, can get such applause from an organization with a long history of documented bias against judicial nominees of Republican presidents, he must be truly superb.

HHScase. This is a distortion of Kavanaughs testimony, as the nominee was simply describing the litigation position that the plaintiffs had taken in the case. In Priests for Life v. HHS, various Catholic nonprofits, including Catholic hospitals, clinics, universities, schools, and social services, challenged the contraceptive mandate provision of the Affordable Care Act on religious liberty grounds. According to the plaintiffs brief in the case, they offered health care coverage to their employeesthat excluded coverage for abortion-inducing products, contraception [except when used for noncontraceptive purposes], sterilization, or related counseling. Although the contraceptive mandate contained an opt-out provision, the plaintiffs argued that under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, it unlawfully burdened their exercise of religion because it required them to submit a form or otherwise be subjected to monetary penalties. NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis. A three-judge panel for the D.C. Circuit ruled against the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs sought rehearing en banc from the full D.C. Circuit, but rehearing was denied. Kavanaugh wrote a dissent from the denial of rehearing en banc, arguing that the HHS mandate would substantially burden the religious organizations exercise of religion and that requiring the religious organizations to submit this form is not the Governments least restrictive means of furthering its interest in facilitating access to contraception for the organizations employees. During the nomination hearing yesterday, Senator Cruz asked Kavanaugh to testify about thePriests for Lifecase and his dissent from denial of rehearing en banc. In response to Cruzs question, Kavanaugh said: That was a group that was being forced to provide a certain kind of health coverage over their religious objection to their employees and under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, the question was: First, was this a substantial burden on the religious exercise? And it seemed to me quite clearly it was. It was a technical matter of filling out a form in that case. They said filling out the form would make them complicit in the provision of the abortion-inducing drugs that they, as a religious matter, objected to. Its clear that in his testimony to Senator Cruz, Kavanaugh was repeating the words that the plaintiffs had used in their own briefs. As Judge Cornelia Pillard, an Obama appointee, explained in her majority opinion for the three-judge panel in the 2014 case: It is undisputed that Plaintiffs all sincerely believe that life begins at conception and that contraception is contrary to Catholic tenets. Priests for Life, for example, was founded to spread the Gospel of Life, which affirms and promotes the culture of life and actively opposes and rejects the culture of death. Pls. Br. 11. Catholic doctrine prohibits impermissible cooperation with evil, and thus opposes providing access to contraceptives, sterilization, and abortion-inducing products, which the Church views as immoral regardless of their cost.Id.at 12. The plaintiffs brief in the case (which, again, was quoted in both the majority opinion and Kavanaughs dissent from denial of rehearing en banc) makes clear that the plaintiffs objected to the provision of health care coverage for several different categories of care, including prescription drug coverage for both contraceptives and what the plaintiffs described as abortion-inducing products. Kavanaugh did what judges routinely do when they discuss cases: speak in terms of what the plaintiffs allege. To say that because Kavanaugh accurately characterized the plaintiffs position he himself believesthat contraceptives areabortion-inducing drugs demonstrates a complete misunderstanding of the Priests for Lifelitigation, as well as Kavanaughs testimony yesterday.

Their statements yesterday were especially instructive, offering necessary reminders about the unique role of Supreme Court justices and members of the U.S. Senate, as well as the importance of civic awareness and education. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Judge Kavanaugh, welcome. Welcome to your family, to your friends. Demonstrating your good judgment, your wife was born and raised in West Texas, and you and she have been friends of Heidi and mine for 20 years. Thank you for your decades of public service, and Im sorry that your daughters had to endure the political circus of this morning. That is, alas, the world that is Washington in 2018. I want to discuss what this hearing is about and what its not about. First, this hearing is not about the qualifications of the nominee. Judge Kavanaugh is, by any objective measure, unquestionably qualified for the Supreme Court. Everyone agrees that he is one of the most respected federal judges in the country. He has impeccable academic credentials  even if he did go to Yale  and you served over a decade on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, often referred to as the second highest court in the land. So, our Democratic colleagues are not trying to make the argument that Judge Kavanaugh is not qualified. Indeed, I have not heard anyone even attempt to make that argument. Second, this hearing is not about his judicial record. Judge Kavanaugh has over 300 published opinions, which altogether amount to over 10,000 pages issued in his role as a federal appellate judge. Everyone agrees that a judges record is by far the most important indicium of what kind of justice that nominee will be. And, tellingly, weve heard very little today from Democratic senators about the actual substance of Judge Kavanaughs judicial record. Third, its important to understand today is also not about documents. Weve heard a lot of arguments this morning about documents. Theres an old saying for trial lawyers: If you have the facts, pound the facts. If you have the law, pound the law. If you have neither, pound the table. Were seeing a lot of table-pounding this morning. The Democrats are focused on procedural issues because they dont have substantive points strong enough to derail this nomination. They dont have substantive criticism with Judge Kavanaughs actual judicial record, so theyre trying to divert everyone with procedural issues. But lets talk about the documents for a moment. The claims that the Democrats are putting forward on documents dont withstand any serious scrutiny. Judge Kavanaugh has produced 511,948 pages of documents. That includes more than 17,000 pages in direct response to this committees written questionnaire, which is the most comprehensive response ever submitted to this committee. The more than a half million pages of documents turned in to this committee is more than the number of pages weve received for the last five Supreme Court nominees combined. Listen to that fact again. The over a half million documents turned over to this committee is more than the last five nominees submitted to this committee combined. So, whats all the fuss over the documents that are not turned over? Most of those concerned Judge Kavanaughs three years as the staff secretary for President George W. Bush. Now many people dont know what a staff secretary does. But thats the position in charge of all of the paper that comes into and out of the Oval Office. Critically, the staff secretary is not the author of the paper coming into and out of the Oval Office; that paper is typically written by the attorney general, by the secretary of state, by other cabinet members, by other senior White House officials. The staff secretary is simply the funnel for collecting their views and then for transferring the paper back and forth. In other words, those documents written by other people say nothing  zero  about Judge Kavanaughs views. And they say nothing  zero  about what kind of justice Judge Kavanaugh would make. But they are by necessity the most sensitive and confidential documents in the White House. They are the documents that are going to the president  this is the advice and the deliberations of the president at the senior level, and the staff secretary is the conduit for those documents. So, why is it that the Democrats are putting so much energy in saying, Hand over all of those documents? Because they know beyond a shadow of doubt that President George W. Bushs White House team is not going to allow every piece of paper that went to the president to be made public any more than any other White House would. Republican or Democrat, no White House would allow every piece of paper that went to and from the president to be made public. Indeed, there are rules and laws and procedures for when and how presidential papers become public. The reason the Democrats are fighting so loudly on this issue is theyre making a demand they know is impossible to meet  and by the way, is utterly irrelevant to what actually Judge Kavanaugh thinks, believes, or has said. It would open up all sorts of fishing expeditions to attack, re-litigate George W. Bushs record as President, and what various cabinet members and senior advisers might or might not have said. But it is, at the end of the day, simply an attempt to distract and delay. Indeed, the multiple motions weve seen from Democrats to delay this confirmation  that reveals the whole joke. Their objective is delay. So, what is this fight about? If its not about documents, its not about Judge Kavanaughs credentials, its not about his judicial record  what is this fight about? I believe this fight is nothing more and nothing less than an attempt by our Democratic colleagues to re-litigate the 2016 presidential election. 2016 was a hard-fought election all around. And, it was the first presidential election in 60 years where Americans went to the polls with a vacant seat on the Supreme Court, one that the next president would fill. Americans knew who had been in that seat: the late Justice Antonin Scalia, one of the greatest jurists ever to sit on the U.S. Supreme Court. It was the first time since President Dwight D. Eisenhowers re-election campaign that a Supreme Court seat was directly on the ballot. Both candidates knew the importance of the vacant Supreme Court seat, and it was a major issue of contention in the presidential election. Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton were both clear about what kind of justices and judges they would appoint. During all three presidential debates, both candidates were asked what qualities were most important to them when selecting a Supreme Court justice. Secretary Clintons answer was clear. She wanted a Supreme Court justice who would be a liberal progressive willing to rewrite the U.S. Constitution, willing to impose liberal policy agendas that she could not get through the democratic process  that the Congress of the United States would not adopt, but that she hoped five unelected lawyers would force on the American people. Thats what Hillary Clinton promised for her judicial nominees. Then-candidate Donald Trump gave a very different answer. He said he was looking to appoint judges in the mold of Justice Scalia. He said he wanted to appoint judges who would interpret the Constitution based on its original public meaning, who would interpret the statutes according to the text, and who would uphold the rule of law and treat parties fairly regardless of who they are or where they come from. Then-candidate Donald Trump also did something that no presidential candidate has done before. He published a list of nominees that he would choose from when filing Justice Scalias seat, providing unprecedented transparency to the American people. All of this was laid before the American people as they went to the polls on November 8, 2016. And the American people made a choice that night. Now, my Democratic colleagues are not happy with the choice the American people made. But, as President Obama famously said, Elections have consequences. Because the American people had the chance to vote, a national referendum on the direction of the Supreme Court. I have said a number of times that Justice Gorsuchs nomination and Judge Kavanaughs nomination have almost a super-legitimacy in that they were ratified, they were decided by the American people in a direct vote in 2016. And so the Democratic obstruction today is all about trying to reverse that election. Theyre unhappy with the choice the American people want. And theres a reason that the American people want strong constitutionalists on the U.S. Supreme Court. Most Americans, and I know the overwhelming majority of Texans, want judges who will follow the law, and will not impose their policy preferences on the rest of us, and who will be faithful to the Constitution and the Bill of Rights  justices who will uphold fundamental liberties like free speech, like religious liberty, like the Second Amendment  thats what this election was about. And, if you look at each of these  lets take free speech. Its worth noting that in 2014, every Democratic member of this committee voted to amend the United States Constitution to repeal the free-speech provisions of the First Amendment. And sadly, every Democrat in the Senate agreed with that position, voting to give Congress unprecedented power to regulate political speech. It was a sad day for this institution. Years earlier, Ted Kennedy, the great liberal lion, had opposed a very similar effort. And Ted Kennedy said, We havent amended the Bill of Rights in over 200 years. Now is no time to start. Ted Kennedy was right then, and not a single Democrat in the U.S. Senate had the courage to agree with Ted Kennedy and support free speech. Indeed, they voted party line to repeal the free-speech provisions of the First Amendment. That is radical. That is extreme. And its part of the reason the American people voted for a president who would put justices on the Court who would protect our free speech. How about religious liberty? Religious liberty is another fundamental protection that the Democrats in the Senate have gotten extreme and radical on. Indeed, our Democratic colleagues want justices who will rubber-stamp efforts like the Obama administrations efforts litigating against the Little Sisters of the Poor. Litigating against Catholic nuns trying to force them to pay for abortion-inducing drugs and others. That is a radical and extreme proposition. And to show just how dramatic Senate Democrats have gotten, every single Senate Democrat just a few years ago voted to gut the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. Legislation that passed Congress with overwhelming bipartisan support in 1993, was signed into law by Bill Clinton and yet, two decades later, the Democratic party has determined that religious freedom is inconvenient for their policy and political objectives. They want justices that will further that assault on religious liberty. And finally, lets take the Second Amendment. In the presidential debates, Hillary Clinton explicitly promised to nominate justices who would overturnHeller v. District of Columbia.Helleris the landmark decision issued by Justice Scalia, likely the most significant decision of his entire tenure on the bench, and it upheld the individual right to keep and bear arms. Now, Hillary Clinton was quite explicit. She wanted judges who would vote to overturnHellerand indeed, a number of our Democratic colleagues, thats what they want as well. OverturningHeller, I believe, would be a truly radical proposition. To understand why, youd have to understand what the four dissenters said inHeller. The four dissenters inHellersaid the Second Amendment protects no individual right to keep and bear arms whatsoever, that it protects merely a collective right of the militia. The consequence of that radical proposition would mean that Congress could pass a law making it a felony, a criminal offense, for any American to own any firearm. And, neither you nor I nor any American would have any individual right whatsoever under the Second Amendment. It would effectively erase the Second Amendment from the Bill of Rights. That is a breathtakingly extreme proposition. It is what Hillary Clinton promised her justices would do, and at the end of the day its what this fight is about. We know that every Democratic member of this committee is going to vote no. We dont have to speculate. Every single one of them has publicly announced theyre voting no. Doesnt depend on what they read in documents, doesnt depend on Judge Kavanaugh says at this hearing  theyve announced ahead of time theyre voting no, and most of the Democrats in the Senate have announced that in the full Senate. But everyone should understand, Judge Kavanaugh has handed over more documents than any nominee  more than the last five combined, Republican and Democratic nominees. Its not about documents, its not about qualification, its not about record. What it is about is politics. It is about Democratic Senators trying to re-litigate the 2016 election and, just as importantly, working to begin litigating the 2020 presidential election. But we had an opportunity for the American people to speak. They did. They voted in 2016, and they wanted judges and justices who will be faithful to the Constitution. Thats why Im confident at the end of what Shakespeare would describe as a lot of sound and fury signifying nothing, I am confident that Judge Kavanaugh will become Justice Kavanaugh, and will be confirmed to the United States Supreme Court. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Watch Senator Cruzs opening statementhere. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Judge Kavanaugh, and thank you also, Ashley, Margaret, and Eliza for being here. I want to start by saying that the fact that there is so much angst over a single nominee, a single judicial nominee, tells you everything you need to know about why it is that we need judges, now more than ever, who are willing to read the law and interpret it based on what the law says, rather than on the basis of something else. It also tells you more than anything else you could need to know about the need to restore a discussion of civics in this country, to restore a discussion about federalism and separation of powers, about where power is concentrated and where it shouldnt be, and what the role of each branch of the federal government is and is not. Many of the comments, many of the outbursts that weve had today suggest that we need to return to some of those fundamental principles, and I dont care whether youre a liberal Democrat or a conservative Republican or something in between. These principles apply. Theyre principles to which we have sworn an oath, and theyre principles that I think we would do well to restore and focus on once again. If ever were to return to an era of civility, we will return to that era on the basis of those foundational, structural principles within our Constitution. Over the next few days, Judge Kavanaugh, a number of members of this committee are going to ask you questions, questions about cases that youve handled as a lawyer, cases that youve decided as a judge, about your record, about your qualifications. On that point about your record and your qualifications: The suggestion that you misled this committee at any point in your previous hearings is absurd, and the absurdity of that suggestion will be borne out in the coming days, I am certain of it. Some of these questions will in fact be fair, and others will be unfair, and I think its important for us to acknowledge that at the outset. This is the third time youve had the quote-unquote privilege of appearing before this committee. So youre seeing some familiar faces on this side of the dais. Youre also seeing some new faces, but I think youll find that in a lot of ways, nothing has really changed since you were last here twelve years ago.And some of these unfair questions will ask you to promise to vote a certain way in particular cases that are likely to come before the Court. When you look back at history, answering these kinds of questions is sort of how the practice of holding these hearings began  so that Senators could ask nominees how they might vote, how they might rule, in particular cases. But this didnt always happen. In fact, it wasnt until1916 that this even started. You see, there have been 113 justices confirmed to the Supreme Court so far. The first 66 were confirmed without a hearing. The idea of a hearing is relatively new. Its about 102 years old. We went for between 125 and 130 under our constitutional republic without ever having a hearing. But regardless, we started having hearings just over a century ago. The very first Supreme Court confirmation hearing occurred in 1916, withJustice Louis Brandeis. After Louis Brandeis was nominated to the Court, some called for a hearing. Now, if were honest with ourselves, if were honest about history, maybe it had to do with anti-Semitic fervor and the fact that Justice Brandeis was Jewish. But Senators also wanted to determine whether Brandeis would use his seat on the Supreme Court to advocate for some of the things that he had advocated for as a private citizen, as a public-interest attorney. They wanted to know how he might vote in particular cases. They didnt ask Justice Brandeis to testify, significantly, but they did in fact ask some outside witnesses what they thought about his nomination. The next important moment, one could argued, occurred in 1939, when Felix Frankfurter became the first nominee to himself testify before the committee. At the time, Frankfurter was controversial in part because he was he was born overseas. But senators also worried that Frankfurter was a radical based on his defense of anarchists in court. So again, senators wanted assurances about how Frankfurter might rule in particular cases, in particular what results he might reach in a particular type of case. Frankfurter, however, significantly, declined to engage with senators on those topics, and insisted that his public record spoke for itself. NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis. Justice Stewarts nomination in1959 was another turning point. Senators seeking to resistBrown v. Board of Educationwanted to grill Stewart on his views on integration. Others still wanted to grill Stewart about his views on national security. So senators turned up the heat a little bit more in that hearing. Like Frankfurter before him, Justice Stewart did not provide substantive answers to their questions. When they wanted to know how he might rule in particular cases, he appropriately declined, just as his predecessors had. Twenty-eight years later, 28 years after Justice Stewart came through this committee, the Senate considered Robert Borks nomination to the Supreme Court. This was another significant turning point, and in my view, it remains a rock-bottom moment for the Senate, and for the Senate Judiciary Committee. Without getting into the gory details here, I think it suffices to say that Senator Ted Kennedy and Judge Bork did not agree on certain matters of constitutional law, and Kennedys response was to savage  unfairly in my opinion  the results Bork would reach if confirmed to the Supreme Court. This history shows that, over the better part of a century, the Judiciary Committee has gradually created something of a new norm, a norm in which members demand that nominees speak about specific cases in return for favorable treatment from the committee as the jurists are going through this process. Nominees, for the most part, have gracefully resisted trading confirmation in exchange for promises about how they might vote in particular cases brought before them. To give two famous examples: Justice Scalia refused to say whetherMarbury v. Madisonwas settled law, on the ground that it could come before him. And sure enough, last term inOrtiz v. United States, the Supreme Court considered a case implicating the scope ofMarbury. Likewise, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg created the so-called Ginsburg standard  no previews, no forecasts, no hints. Every current member of the Supreme Court has adhered to a similar principle, what we might called theGinsburg standard. Even though nominees have not caved to the pressure, I still believe that there are some aspects of the Senates approach here that might do a disservice to the country and might be frowned upon by future historians. If senators repeatedly ask nominees about outcomes, then the public will be more entitled, or at least more inclined, to think that judges are supposed to be outcome-minded, that thats supposed to be their whole approach to judging, that thats supposed to be what judging is in fact about. But this, of course, undermines the very legitimacy of the courts themselves, the very legitimacy of the tribunal that youve been nominated by the president to serve on. Over time, no free people would accept a judiciary that simply imposes its own policy preferences on the country, absent fidelity to legal principle. Theres a better way for the Senate to approach its work. This process, in my opinion, should be about your qualifications, about your character, and perhaps most importantly, about your approach to judging, your own view about the role of the federal judiciary. It should not be about results in a select number of cases. Youre obviously exceptionally well-qualified. Even your staunchest critics would not claim otherwise. Your academic pedigree, your experience as a practicing lawyer, your experience in government, and your twelve years experience sitting on what many refer to as the second highest court in the land, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. You are independent. Youve written that some of the greatest moments in American judicial history have been when judges stood up to the other branches, were not cowed, and enforced the law. Youve said that judges cannot be buffaloed, influenced, or pressured into worrying too much about transient popularity when we are trying to decide a case and that one of the most important duties of a judge is to stand up for the unpopular party who has the correct position. And youve lived up to your words during your time on the bench. Everyone knows that you served in the Bush administration. And yet when you became a judge, in only two years, you ruled against the Bush administration a total of eight times. For you, it simply doesnt matter who the parties are. It simply doesnt matter that you may have worked for an administration before you became a judge. The only thing that matters is your commitment to correctly applying the law to the facts of any particular case. As far as your approach to judging, you have appropriate respect for precedent. You co-authored an 800-page book on precedent that, among other things, explains that a change in a courts membership alone should not throw former decisions open to reconsideration or justify their reversal. Youve explained that, for a precedent to be overruled, it must be not just wrong but a case with serious practical consequences. Youve voted to overturn circuit precedent only four times during your time on the D.C. Circuit  and each of those cases involved a unanimous decision reached by your colleagues. And you follow binding precedent even if you believe that binding precedent was itself wrongly decided. You decide cases on legal merits, not based on the identity of the parties, and certainly not based on any political beliefs that you may harbor. Weve already heard that your nomination will somehow be bad for women, for the environment, for labor unions, for civil rights, for a whole host of other things that Americans hold near and dear. I have a laundry list of cases in which youve ruled for people in each of those groups. But theres a more fundamental point here that I think needs to be made: The judiciarys decisions are legitimate only to the extent that they are based on sound legal principle and reasoning. And ruling for a preferred party is not itself a sound legal principle. Its quite to the contrary. Jury-rigging decisions and backfilling legal reasoning to reach a particular result  a particularly politically acceptable result in a particular case, no matter how desirable that result might be in any instance  is not a legitimate mode of judicial decision-making, and no free people purportingto have an independent judiciary should ever be willing to settle for that. So my plea to my colleagues today is that we ask Judge Kavanaugh hard questions. I believe were required to do so. The Senate is not and never should be a rubber stamp, particularly when it comes to issuing lifetime appointments, even lifetime appointments on the highest court in the land. But if you disagree with an opinion hes written, make a legal argument as to that issue. Explain why you think its wrong. Dont complain about the results as if the result itself isproofthat hes wrong, when you separate out the result from the legal analysis, from the facts and how they interact with the law in that particular case. And dont ask him to make promises about outcomes in particular cases. If its unacceptable for the president to impose a litmus test, it is surely unacceptable for the United States Senate to do so. Judge Kavanaugh, I look forward to your testimony, and Im grateful to you and your willingness to serve our country and to be considered for this important role. Watch Senator Lees opening statement here. Senator Klobuchar, you did Madison, Lin-Manuel Miranda, the Magna Carta, and your Dad taking you to court. Well done. I had all that on my bingo card. I have little kids, and Ive taken my two little girls to court a few times, too, mostly to juvie just to scare them straight, not to turn them into attorneys.Theres wisdom in Minnesota. Congratulations, Judge, on your nomination. Ashley, congratulations,andcondolences. This process has to stink. Im glad your daughters could get out of the room, and I hope they still get the free day from school. Lets do some good newsbad news. The bad news first, Judge: Since your nomination in July, youve been accused of hating women, hating children, hating clean air, wanting dirty water.Youve been declared an existential threat to our nation. Alumni of Yale Law School, incensed that faculty members at your alma mater praised your selection, wrote a public letter to the school saying quote, People willdieif Brett Kavanaugh is confirmed. This drivel is patently absurd, and I worry that were going to hear more of it over the next few days. But the good news is, it is absurd, and the American people dont believe any of it. This stuff isnt about Brett Kavanaugh, when screamers say this stuff for cable TV news. The people who know you better  not those who are trying to get on TV  they tell a completely different story about who Brett Kavanaugh is. Youve earned high praise from the many lawyers, both right and left, whove appeared before you during your twelve years on the D.C. Circuit. And those whove had youas aprofessor at Yale Law and Harvard Law, people in legal circles invariably applaud your mind, your work, your temperament, your collegiality. Thats who Brett Kavanaugh is. And to quote LisaBlatt, a Supreme Court attorney from the left who has known you for a decade, Sometimes, a superstar is just a superstar, and thats the case with this Judge. The Senate should confirm him. Its pretty obvious to most people going about their work today that the deranged comments dont actually have anything to do with you. So, we should figure out: Why do we talk like this about Supreme Court nominations now? Theres a bunch thatsatypicalin the last 19 to 20 months in America. SenatorKlobuchar isright: The comments from the White House yesterday about trying to politicize the Department of Justice, they were wrong and they should be condemned, and my guess is that Brett Kavanaugh would condemn them. But really, the reason these hearings dontworkis notbecause ofDonald Trump. Its not because of anything these last 20 months. These confirmation hearings havent worked for 31 years in America. People are going to pretend that Americans have no historical memory and supposedly there havent been screaming protestors saying, Women are going to die at every hearing for decades. But this has been happening since Robert Bork. This is a31-yeartradition. Theres nothing really new the last 18 months. So, the fact that the hysteria has nothing to do with you means that we should ask: Whats the hysteria coming from? The hysteria around Supreme Court confirmation hearings is coming from the fact that we have a fundamental misunderstanding of the role of the Supreme Court in American life now. Our political commentary talks about the Supreme Court like they are people wearing red and blue jerseys. Thats a really dangerous thing and, by the way, if they have red and blue jerseys, I would welcome my colleagues to introduce legislation that ends lifetime tenure for the judiciary. Because if theyre just politicians, then the people should have power, and they shouldnt have lifetime appointments. So, until you introduce that legislation, I dont believe you really want the Supreme Court to be a politicized body, though thats the way we constantly talk about it now. We can and we should do better than this. Its predictable now that every confirmation hearing is going to be an overblown, politicized circus. And its because weve accepted a bad new theory about how our three branches of government should work  and in particular about how the judiciary should work. What Supreme Court confirmation hearings should be about is an opportunity to go back and doSchoolhouse Rockcivics for our kids. We should be talking about how a bill becomes a law, and what the job of Article II is, and what the job of Article III is. So, lets try just a little bit. How did we get here, and how do we fix it? I want to make just four brief points. Number one: In our system, the legislative branch is supposed to be the center of our politics. Number two: Its not. Why not? Because for the last century, and increasing by the decade right now, more and more legislative authority is delegated to the executive branch every year. Both parties do it. The legislature is impotent. The legislature is weak. And most people here want their jobs more than they really want to do legislative work. And so they punt most of the work to the next branch. The third consequence is that this transfer of power means that people yearn for a place where politics can actually be done. And when we dont do a lot of big actual political debating here, we transfer it to the Supreme Court. And thats why the Supreme Court is increasingly a substitute political battleground. It is not healthy, but it is what happens, and its something our Founders wouldnt be able to make any sense of. And fourth and finally: We badly need to restore the proper duties and the balance of power from our constitutional system. So point one: The legislative branch is supposed to by the locus of our politics properly understood. Since were here in this room today, because this is a Supreme Court confirmation hearing, were tempted to start with Article III. But really, we need Article III as the part of the Constitution that sets up the judiciary. We really should be starting with Article I, which is us. What is the legislatures job? The Constitutions drafters began with the legislature. These are equal branches, but Article I comes first for a reason, and that is because policymaking is supposed to be done in the body that makes laws. That means that this is supposed to be the institution dedicated to political fights. If we see lots and lots of protests in front of the Supreme Court, thats a pretty good litmus-test barometer of the fact that our republic isnt healthy. Because people shouldnt be thinking they ought to be protesting in front of the Supreme Court. They should be protesting in front of this body. The legislature is designed to be controversial, noisy, sometimes even rowdy, because making laws means we have to hash out that we dont all agree. Government is about power. Government is not just another word for things we do together. The reason we have limited government in America isbecause webelieve in freedom. We believe in souls. We believe in persuasion. We believe in love. And those things arent done by power. But the government acts by power. And since the government acts by power, we should be reticent to use power. And so it means when you differ about power, you have to have a debate. And this institution is supposed to be dedicated to debate and should be based on the premise that we know since we dont all agree, we should try to constrain that power just a little bit, but then we should fight about it and have a vote in front of the American people. And then what happens? The people get to decide if they want to hire us or fire us. They dont have to hire us again. This body is the political branch where policymaking fights should happen. And if we are the easiest people to fire, it means the only way the people can maintain power in our system is if all the politicized decisions happen here. Not in Article II or Article III. So, that brings us to a second point. How do we get to a place where the legislature decided to give away its power? Weve been doing it for a long time. Over the course of the last century, but especially since the 1930s and then ramping up since the 1960s, a whole lot of the responsibility in this body has been kicked to a bunch of alphabet-soup bureaucracies. All the acronyms that people know about their government or dont know about their government are the places where most actual policymaking, kind of in a way, lawmaking is happening right now. This is not what Schoolhouse Rock says. Theres no verse of Schoolhouse Rock that says give a whole bunch of power to the alphabet-soup agencies and let them decide what the governance decisions should be for the people, because the people dont have any way to fire the bureaucrats. And so what we mostly do around this body is not pass laws. What we mostly do is decide to give permission to the secretary or the administratorof bureaucracyX, Y, or Z to make law-like regulations. Thats mostly what we do here. We go home and pretend we make laws. No, we dont. We write giant pieces of legislation  1,200 pages, 1,500 pages long  that people havent read, filled with all these terms that are undefined, and we say the secretary of such and such shall promulgate rules that do the rest of our dang jobs. Thats why there are so many fights about the executive branch and about the judiciary, because this body rarely finishes its work  and the House is even worse. (I dont really believe that. It just seemed like I needed to unite us in some way.) So, I admit that there are rational arguments that one could make for this new system. The Congress cant manage all the nitty-grittydetails of everything about modern government, and this system tries to give power and control to experts in their fields where most of us in Congress dont know much of anything  about technical matters, for sure  but you can also impugn our wisdom if you want. But when youre talking about technical, complicated matters, its true that the Congress would have a hard time sorting out every final dot and tittle about every detail. But the real reason, at the end of the day, that this institution punts most of its power to executive-branch agencies is because its a convenient way for legislators to be able to avoid taking responsibilityfor controversial and often unpopular decisions. If people want to get reelected over and over again  and thats your highest goal  if your biggest long-term thought around here is about your own incumbency, then actually giving away your power is a pretty good strategy. Its not a good life, but its a pretty good strategy for incumbency. And so, at the end of the day, a lot of the power delegation that happens from this branch is because the Congress has decided to self-neuter. Well, guess what? The important thing isnt whether or not the Congress has lame jobs. The important thing is that when the Congress neuters itself and gives power to an unaccountable fourth branch of government, it means the people are cut out of the process. Theres nobody in Nebraska, theres nobody in Minnesota or Delaware who elected the Deputy Assistant Administrator of Plant Quarantine at the USDA. And yet, if theDeputy Assistant Administrator of Plant Quarantine does something that makes Nebraskans lives really difficult  which happens to farmers and ranchers in Nebraska  who do they protest to? Where do they go? How do they navigate the complexity and the thicket of all the lobbyists in this town to do executive-agency lobbying? They cant. And so what happens is that they dont have any ability to speak out and to fire people through an election. And so ultimately, when the Congress is neutered, when the administrative state grows, when there is this fourth branch of government, it makes it harder and harder for the concerns of citizens to be represented and articulated by people that the people know they have power over. All the power right now, or almost all the power right now, happens offstage. And that leaves a lot of people wondering who is looking out for me. And that brings us to the third point, the Supreme Court becomes our substitute political battleground. Its only nine people. You can know em. You can demonize em. You can try to make em messiahs. But ultimately, because people cant navigate their way through the bureaucracy, they turn to the Supreme Court looking for politics. And knowing that our elected officials no longer care enough to do the hard work of reasoning through the places where we differ, and deciding to shroud our power at times, it means that we look for nine justices to be super-legislators. We look for nine justices to try to right the wrongs from other places in the process. When people talk about wanting tohave empathy from their justices, this is what theyre talking about.Theyretalking about trying to make thejusticesdo something that the Congress refuses to do as itconstantlyabdicates its responsibility. The hyperventilating that we see in this process and the way thattodayshearingstartedwith 90 minutes of theatrics that are pre-planned with certain members of the other side here, it shows us a system that is wildly out of whack. And thus, a fourth and final point. The solution here is not to try to find judges who will be policymakers. The solution is not to try to turn the Supreme Court into anelectionbattle for TV. The solution is to restore a proper constitutional order with the balance of powers. We need Schoolhouse Rock back. We need a Congress that writes laws and then stands before the people and suffers the consequences and gets to go back to our own MountVernon,if thats what the electors decide. We need an executive branch that has a humble view of its job as enforcing the law, not trying to write laws in the Congresss absence. And, we need a judiciary that tries to apply written laws to facts in cases that are actually before it. This is the elegant and the fair process that the Founders created. Its the process where the people who are elected  two and six years in this institution, four years in the executive branch  can be fired because the justices and the judges, the men and women who serve Americas people by wearing black robes, theyre insulated from politics. This is why we talk about an independent judiciary. This is why they wear robes. This is why weshouldnttalk about Republican and Democratic judges and justices. This is why we say justice is blind. This is why we give judges lifetime tenure. And, this is why this is the last job interview Brett Kavanaugh will ever have. Because hes going to a job where hes not supposed to be a super-legislator. So, the question before us today is not what did Brett Kavanaugh think eleven years ago on some policy matter. The question before us is whether or not he has thetemperamentand the character to take his policy views and his political preferences and put them in a box marked irrelevant and set it aside every morning when he puts on the black robe. The question is, does he have the character andtemperamentto do that? If you dont think he does, vote no. But, if you think he does, stop the charades. Because at the end of the day I think all of us know that Brett Kavanaugh understands his job isnt to rewrite laws as he wishes they were. He understands that hes not being interviewed to be a super-legislator. He understands that his job isnt to seek popularity. His job is to be fair and dispassionate. It is not to exercise empathy. It is to follow written laws. Contrary to the Onion-like smears that we hearoutside,Judge Kavanaugh doesnt hate women and children. Judge Kavanaugh doesnt lust after dirty water and stinky air. No, looking at his record, it seems to me that what he actually dislikes are legislators that are too lazy and too risk-averse to do our actual jobs. It seems to me that if you read his 300-plus opinions, what his opinions reveal to me is a dissatisfaction  I think he would argue a constitutionally compelled dissatisfaction  with power-hungry executive-branch bureaucrats doing our job when we failed to do it. And in this view, I think hesalignedwith the Founders. For our Constitution places power not in the hands of this citysbureaucracy which cant be fired  but our Constitution places the policy-making power in the 535 of our hands because the voters can hire and fire us. And if the voters are going to retain their power, they need a legislature thats responsive to politics, not ajudiciarythats responsive to politics. It seems to me that Judge Kavanaugh is ready to do his job. The question for us is whether were ready to do our job. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Watch the video of Senator Sasses opening statement here.

 Supreme Court confirmation hearings have mostly been theater for a long time. The dismaying thing about the latest episode  the Brett Kavanaugh Show  is that it became the theater of the absurd. In the classic absurdist dramas of the 1950s and 1960s, Brittanica.com explains, European playwrights did away with most of the logical structures of traditionaltheatre. There is little dramatic action as conventionally understood; however frantically the characters perform, their busyness serves to underscore the fact that nothing happens to change their existence. Thats a pretty good description of the sound and fury signifying nothing on display this week from Democrats and protesters alike. The central complaint of the Democrats is that they havent been given access to records from Kavanaughs time working in the Bush administration. They demand their release by the current White House, or the Senate Judiciary Committee, or Kavanaugh, or, perhaps by this writing, Aslan the Lion, deity of Narnia. Explaining the ginned-up controversy would be a waste of time, because the point of these demands merely is to put on an absurdist drama in which the finale is never in doubt. Judge Brett Kavanaugh, an indisputably qualified nominee, even according to the typically liberal American Bar Association, will be confirmed no matter what the Democrats do and no matter how many indecipherable yawps get shouted by the hysterics in the hearing room. The most obvious proof that this is all theater, isnt The Handmaids Tale cosplayers outside the hearing rooms, its the senators most passionately shouting that they require more information despite already declaring they wont vote for Kavanaugh, no matter what that information reveals. One of the lead protagonists of this drama, New Jersey senator Cory Booker, exclaimed Thursday morning that this is the closest Ill ever get in my life to an I am Spartacus moment,and threatened to divulge confidential documents to the public, even if it meant risking losing his job. I am going to release the email about racial profiling, and I understand that the penalty comes with potential ousting from the Senate,Booker declared. Again, because nothing actually matters when the goal is to create dramatic sound bites for Twitter and TV and your 2020 presidential campaign videos, he later insisted that he wasnt breaking the rules by releasing confidential documents. He was right the first time: It is against the rules to release confidential documents. Booker was hardly alone in the forced buffoonery. More than a dozen of his fellow Democrats joined in the rebellion against Senate rules, in effect shoutingI am Spartacustoo, and with mawkish bravery dared the Senate to expel them. But all this Sturm und Drang on the public stage was pointless. Indeed, the documents he ended up releasing had already been cleared for public viewing  and Booker reportedly knew that beforehand, but pretended otherwise. Gotta stay in character. Oh, and the ominous email about racial profiling Booker released? It showed that Kavanaugh was opposed to racial profiling. In Yiddish humor, which has its own absurdist bent, a schlemiel is a clumsy person who often spills his soup, and a schlimazel is the sort of chronically unlucky person the soup lands on. Booker achieved a double play: He spilled the soup on himself. Nebraska senator Ben Sasse, in one of the best opening statements of any hearing Ive ever heard, cut through it all. Since your nomination in July, Sasse said, youve been accused of hating women, hating children, hating clean air, wanting dirty water.Youve been declared an existential threat to our nation. Alumni of Yale Law School, incensed that faculty members at your alma mater praised your selection, wrote a public letter to the school saying, quote, People willdieif Brett Kavanaugh is confirmed. This drivel is patently absurd, he continued, and I worry that were going to hear more of it over the next few days. But the good news is, it is absurd, and the American people dont believe any of it. Sasse eloquently expanded on a point Ive been banging my spoon on my highchair about for a while now: The legislative branch is becoming a parliament of pundits, in which both parties teem with people desperate to emote, preen, and shriek for voters and donors who follow politics like its a form of entertainment, and, in this case, a theater of the absurd.  2018 Tribune Content Agency LLC IN THE NEWS: [WATCH] Senior Trump Official Describes Resistance Inside Administration   NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.

Sasses statement has drawn praise from conservatives, including at NRO, and the Wall Street Journal published a version of it. Its not hard to see why the senator has earned the applause. He made accurate and important observations that transcend the partisan scuffling over Kavanaughobservations that have been central to conservative thought for a long time but that too few elected officials ever consider. The passion that so many people invest in the Supreme Court, he said, is a symptom of constitutional dysfunction. Congress should be the center of politics (presumably meaning national politics). But Congress has shirked the job of legislating, instead ceding much of its power to the courts and to the bureaucracy. It has given up power in order to hide from responsibility. All true. But while the pieces of Sasses argument are sound, he has stuck them together in a way that does not fit. He tries to argue that congressional delegation of power to executive-branch agencies has caused the public to turn to the courts. NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis. Heres the core of his case: When the administrative state growswhen there is this fourth branch of governmentit becomes harder for the concerns of citizens to be represented and articulated by officials who answer to the people. The Supreme Court becomes a substitute political battleground. . . . Because people cant navigate their way through the bureaucracy, they turn to the Supreme Court looking for politics. This account is implausible. It is certainly true, as Sasse says, that Congress has expanded the power of the federal courts by passing vague laws that the other branches of government must essentially finish writing. But most of the public involvement in Supreme Court confirmation battles does not concern the administrative state at all. There are a lot more citizens on each side who are worked up about the Courts decisions on abortion, same-sex marriage, guns, and other social issues than who are concerned about reining in or empowering alphabet-soup bureaucracies. Congress didnt cede power to the bureaucracy to set policy in most of these areas. It didnt cede power to the courts, either. The courts just took it. To the extent Congress is responsible for the current division of power over these issues, its mistake has been not to wrest that power back. The politicization of Supreme Court confirmations is much more easily and directly traceable to the Courts social-issues rulings from the 1960s onward than it is to the congressional delegation of power to the executive branch that began decades earlier. The Journals editors have accurately summarized Sasses argument. Their headline runs, Blame Congress for Politicizing the Court: When lawmakers hand power to bureaucrats, the people expect judges to act as superlegislators. The Court actually brought on much of this politicization itself. (See Justice Antonin Scalias dissent in Planned Parenthood v. Casey for a fiery and focused elaboration of this point.) And we will not succeed in restoring a properly functioning constitutional order if we forget it. NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.

Circuit nomination and at his hearing last week. See, for example, this Mother Jones article from last Friday, titled Five Times Brett Kavanaugh Appears to Have Lied to Congress While Under Oath. (See also, in response to such dreck, David Frenchs The Character Assassination of Brett Kavanaugh.) No one who paid attention to last weeks hearing could think that Senate Democrats made any actual headway on these charges. Above the Laws David Lat has done some excellent Twitter threads on the topics, and Ive added some threads as well. But given how broadly these smears have circulated, I think it important to address and expose them in comprehensive stand-alone blog posts. As I will show, no intelligent and fairminded person would peddle these smears. On a full understanding of each matter, there is no basis whatsoever for calling into question the truthfulness of Kavanaughs testimony. Ill add here that I am grateful to count Brett Kavanaugh as a friend. Ive known him for some 25 years and have worked with him both in the private sector and in government, including in the early years of the George W. Bush administration, when I was principal deputy in DOJs Office of Legal Counsel and Kavanaugh worked in the White House. My high regard for him gives me additional motivation to refute the smears against him. But as you will see, my arguments stand on their own and do not depend on my personally attesting to his character.

Dont Let Out Your Inner Feinstein That was . . . odd. Last night, Ed Whelan, president of the Ethics and Public Policy Center and longtime friend of NRO, laid out a theory in a series of tweets that suggested that someone else attacked Christine Blasey Ford back in 1982. He contended that one of the four boys was the likely host of the party, pointed to a particular house that matched Fords description, and named a former classmate of Brett Kavanaughs who resembles him, both then and now, as a potential alternative suspect. The problem is, if we dont like Ford making this accusation against Kavanaugh with such a dearth of evidence . . . how fair is it to make this accusation against a former classmate with such circumstantial evidence? In the series of tweets, Ed acknowledged that he doesnt know what happened in 1982 and says at one point in his series of tweets that he doesnt want to state, imply or insinuate that [the classmate] or anyone else committed the sexual assault. Except . . . the series of tweets do just that, dont they? How else are we supposed to interpret this information? At another point, Ed says, It is regrettable that private citizens are being drawn into this. But that is the product of Senator Feinsteins shockingly shoddy handling of the whole matter. No doubt Feinstein handled this matter about as badly as possible from the start, but the question is, how do we on the right respond to that? Do we emulate what she does? Or do we demonstrate a different, better standard  that clear and indisputable evidence matters for accusations against Kavanaugh, it matters for accusations against this classmate, and it matters for accusations against everybody? This morning, Ed recognized the bad judgment he had demonstrated. He tweeted, I made an appalling and inexcusable mistake of judgment in posting the tweet thread in a way that identified Kavanaughs Georgetown Prep classmate. I take full responsibility for that mistake, and I deeply apologize for it. I realize that does not undo the mistake. For what its worth, Ford denies that this classmate is the one who attacked her. Its common on the right to point out that President Trumps brash methods are bringing out the worst in the Democrats. The question is, do we want the worst in the Democrats to bring out the worst in us? Either Testify, or Dont  This Is Not a Contract Negotiation Meanwhile, Fords lawyers laid out a litany of demands for her testimony: Either she wants to testify or she doesnt. Her lawyers said she was ready Monday night. NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis. If it were up to me, Id declare the hearing will be held this coming Monday. Security will be airtight with a recommendation that the hearing be closed to the public and no television cameras at all. (If either Ford or Kavanaugh wish to separately address the press and repeat the arguments from their testimony on camera, theyre free to do so elsewhere.) The public would be granted access to an audio recording and transcript. This arrangement would balance the publics right to know with Fords desire to protect her privacy, and hopefully minimize senatorial grandstanding. There would be no requirement for a written statement, each side would be free to have either senators or counsel ask questions, and in keeping with tradition, the accused will have the chance to respond to the accuser after her testimony. There would be no time limits on witness testimony; when theyre done, theyre done. Ford is comfortable detailing her accusation on the record to reporters from the national news media. I dont see why she would not be comfortable detailing her accusation under oath under penalty of perjury. Kavanaugh has already submitted testimony on this matter to the Judiciary Committee under penalty of perjury. A cynic would suggest that the strategy of her legal team is not merely to drag out negotiations, but to avoid coming to an agreement  so that her accusation remains out there and that she is never subjected to anything resembling cross-examination or questioning about the portions of her account that are missing or vague. Foes of Kavanaugh would love to establish the narrative, Ford was willing to testify but the Judiciary Committee silenced her! which is why weve got the likes of Senator Gillibrand insisting that the invitation to testify amounted to silencing her. Because of how thoroughly shes left no social-media footprint  no videos of her teaching or speaking at conferences, no Facebook page, no Twitter or Instagram account, very few recent photos  we have little sense of how she comes across to an audience. Perhaps Ford comes across as exceptionally compelling, authentic, and honest, and the kind of perfect witness that a defense attorney would fear. Or perhaps she doesnt, and her legal advisers want to keep her away from television cameras, for fear that much of the public simply wouldnt find her credible. When Beto Met Ted . . . er, When Robert Met Rafael Tonight is the first of three debates between Ted Cruz and Beto ORourke. Democrats are dancing a jig over the Cook Political Report changing its assessment of the race from Leans Republican to Toss Up. Make no mistake, ORourke is going to give Cruz the toughest race that any Texas Republican has faced in the past 30 years. Hes got buckets of charisma, the biggest fundraising haul of any Senate challenger, messianic-media coverage on par with early Barack Obama, and hes going to get presidential buzz, no matter how this race turns out. (One note on ORourkes fundraising: He takes positions that are not necessarily popular in Texas but are very popular among Democratic donors nationwide, such as support for kneeling NFL players, openness to abolishing ICE, banning AR-15s, and impeaching President Trump. Every time he does this, national donors large and small open up their wallets. Lots of Democrats candidates have these positions, but ORourke stands out because hes a Texan who takes these positions.) If Cruz were sleepwalking through this general election, there would be good reason to worry. But Cruz has a big structural advantage  perhaps as many as 850,000 more GOP-leaning Texans than Democratic-leaning ones  and its very hard to imagine ORourke winning if the Texas Republican party get-out-the-vote operation does its job. Cruz isnt taking this lightly. ADDENDA: Since everyone will ask . . . All credit to the Cleveland Browns; after this win, almost beating the Saints on the road and tying the Steelers, theyre clearly nothing like last years team. Maybe they need to catch a possum in the stadium every week. I try not to be the kind of fan who screams Fire the coach! after every defeat. New York Jets head coach Todd Bowles undoubtedly has some strengths, and there have been times where hes gotten players to exceed the limitations of their talent. Lord knows I want to see him succeed. But in his fourth season, with the Monday night excitement fading into the rear-view mirror, it looks like adding an exciting and young quarterback isnt enough to change the flaws of a team that rarely figures out how to string together back-to-back wins. Whatever new talent gets added, it gets offset by some breakdowns in some other part of the team. Sam Darnold looks good, but his receivers drop passes, or the line gives him almost no time to throw, or the running game stalls. Jamal Adams is a ball-hawk but the pressure disappears and pass coverage breaks down in the clutch. Last night, Bowles said, The whole ballgame is on me. Okay, then. This is the fourth year of the Bowles era, with a record of 21 wins and 30 losses so far. The team is dealing with the same problems that bedeviled them for the entirety of his tenure  slow starts to games, dumb penalties and a general lack of discipline, an offense that sputters and stumbles when a big drive is needed most, and a defense that will look great on one drive and suddenly cant stop anybody when the game is on the line. No matter the coordinators, the team always looks like its playing not to lose, instead of playing to win. Good franchises dont change coaches every few years, bringing in their own offensive systems and playbooks and slowing the development of young players. The year is still young. But if we get another year of more of the same . . . why would year five under Bowles be a dramatic improvement over year four?

 We hear a lot about norms these days. We live in a time when alleged pre-existing norms of decency, civility, and respect are being cast aside for the sake of winning. The ends justify the means, and a dignified loser is just that: a loser. There is a real sense that were losing something irreplaceable, a shared respect that once allowed partisans to battle over ideas while remaining bound together as citizens of the worlds greatest constitutional republic. John McCains funeral this weekend was supposed to have reminded us of these national values, to have pricked our consciences. It was an occasion for the Washington establishment to unite in the face of an angry, temperamental president and say, Enough! There is dignity in public service and advocacy. There is a better way. Unfortunately, it appears that all too much of the talk about norms and civility and decency is just another weapon of convenience, to be dropped the moment it is perceived to pave the path of defeat. Just look at the disgusting spectacle that was day one (and the opening of day two) of Brett Kavanaughs confirmation hearing. Before I continue, let me remind you that Kavanaugh is the opposite of a norm-violating, civility-straining, Trumpist jurist. He is the very definition of a GOP-establishment lawyer. He would be a front-runner for a SCOTUS nomination in any Republican administration. He is not only solidly within the mainstream of originalist legal thought, hes so respected across the aisle that Elena Kagan hired him to teach at Harvard Law School. In other words, throughout his career, Kavanaugh has helped maintain norms rather than violating them. Hes the living embodiment of the kind of person  and the kind of politics  that Democrats now claim they miss in the age of Trump. Yet yesterday, from the top down, from senators to protesters to online trolls, the Democrats offered a preview of how theyd react to any Republican nominee, and it was a shining example of how and why conservatives dont believe for one moment that Donald Trump is the sole source of American dysfunction. Consider first the utterly frivolous behavior of multiple Democratic senators. Within seconds of the hearings start they interrupted Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Charles Grassley with demands that he adjourn the hearing. The pretext was one of those eye-glazing Washington debates over document production, in which senators whod already vowed weeks ago to vote against Kavanaugh claimed they couldnt possibly evaluate him properly based on the hundreds of thousands of pages they already had (including more than a decade of judicial opinions). They instead absolutely needed every scrap of paper he ever touched, so . . . what? They could cast a more emphatic no vote? Make no mistake, this was purely a sop to the Democratic base. You see, theres this #StopKavanaugh hashtag out there, and its sparked speaking tours and panel discussions and such, and if the senators just rolled over and debated plain, old, boring legal doctrines, then they wouldnt look very good to the #Resistance, now would they? They had to do something dramatic, no matter how ineffectual. So for two hours, petty interruptions were substituted for serious debate. The senators were outdone, of course, by the angry activists in the room. One of the first ways you can discern whether to dismiss a protester, pundit, or politician as a serious person is whether they pay any attention at all to The Handmaids Tale as some sort of allegory for our times. The president is a libertine philanderer who pays off porn stars and playmates, but somehow were about two steps from Gilead. Yet sure as the night follows day, the Handmaids showed up to Kavanaughs hearing, and along with them the Mos Eisley cantina of shrieking protesters. Lets be clear, had angry Tea Party protesters caused the same scale of disruption at a Democratic hearing, news outlets would be shaking their heads at the dangerous lack of respect for a dignified nominee. Instead, all too many folks think this is what democracy looks like: serial attempts to exercise an incoherent, screaming hecklers veto. But if you thought the sad display in the hearing room was the days nadir, youve never heard of Twitter. Online, conspiracy theories exploded, beginning with this one: Kavanaughs former law clerk Zina Bash is flashing a white power sign behind him during his Senate confirmation hearing. They literally want to bring white supremacy to the Supreme Court. What a national outrage and a disgrace to the rule of law. pic.twitter.com/uQGOpNa6xg  Eugene Gu, MD (@eugenegu) September 4, 2018  For those wondering, Zina Bash is one of the more respected and talented young conservative lawyers in Washington. As her husband  John Bash, the U.S. attorney for the Western District of Texas explained on Twitter, shes Mexican on her mothers side and Jewish on her fathers side. Her paternal grandparents are Holocaust survivors, and she was born in Mexico. So, no, its not remotely credible to believe she was flashing a white-power symbol. Those facts didnt deter the online left, though. The claims kept spreading until they turned into an instant left-wing version of the legendary Pizzagate conspiracy unsupported by any meaningful facts yet fervently believed by thousands. Then there was Snubgate, the claim that Kavanaugh deliberately refused to shake the hand of a father of a slain Parkland teen. The man, Fred Guttenberg, approached Kavanaugh in the scrum during a break in the hearing, he stuck out his hand, security approached, and Kavanaugh turned away. Thats it.

Guttenberg went on CNN and made an unsubstantiated claim that Kavanaugh not only intentionally snubbed him, but personally asked that he be removed: Father of Slain Parkland Teen (Fred Guttenberg) Says Not Only Did Kavanaugh Turn Away As Soon As He Mentioned His Murdered Daughter.

Push aside security to engage with the man, despite not knowing who he is? Its hard to believe that Im wasting my time talking about any of this, but the claims against Kavanaugh and Bash raced around the web. They were taken as proof of Kavanaughs depravity and Bashs racism. Millions of people viewed the videos. Tweets and retweets skyrocketed into the hundreds of thousands. And what did all this sound and fury mean? Not much for Brett Kavanaugh, who started the day almost certain to be confirmed and ended it  if anything  even more of a lock for confirmation. But for our body politic, it was one more piece of evidence than the battle over civility long ago reached the IranIraq phase  a grim war of attrition between two sides that commit atrocities for sport. The norms of American political life arent in fact the respect and civility extolled at John McCains funeral. Increasingly, they are the frivolity, ridiculousness, and gross behavior you saw yesterday. So, the next time you hear grave words about civility, respond with a request: Show, dont tell. When the chips are down, will you practice what you preach? Yesterdays performance provides a clear answer, and it should worry all of us who genuinely care about health of American political discourse.

								Kavanaugh to Give Senate Calendar Supporting Denial of Allegations							
 If Franz Kafka had written about confirmation hearings, he couldnt have come up with a better scenario than the one now unfolding in the U.S. Senate. Brett Kavanaugh, who the day before yesterday was an unimpeachable pillar of the legal establishment, stands accused of a heinous offense that is almost impossible to definitively rebut. Even if he is completely innocent of the charge that he sexually assaulted a teenage girl at a high school party 35 years ago, he will be forever considered guilty of it by some portion of the public. This is not due process, or any kind of decent process at all, but how the Senate conducts its business, especially if you are a conservative jurist on the cusp of confirmation to the Supreme Court. A 51-year-old research psychologist named Christine Blasey Ford went public with the accusation in a Washington Post interview over the weekend, saying she feared for her life when the teenage Kavanaugh attacked her. The charge was inevitably viewed through the prism of #MeToo. But it lacks the credibility of allegations that have felled powerful men over the past two years. There is no contemporaneous corroboration. There is no pattern of conduct on the part of Kavanaugh. There is no weaselly, Well, I dont remember it that way, but Im sorry if she was offended denial; Kavanaugh rejects the charge categorically.  Contrast the allegations against, to take a Republican from another moral universe, the Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore. A key accuser from decades ago told friends about her relationship with Moore at the time. There was more than one allegation  indeed, Moore had a reputation for unsavory interest in teenage girls. When he first reacted to the stories, Moore gave a mealy-mouthed denial. Fords memory is so fuzzy that there is very little in her story that can be corroborated or debunked. She doesnt know what year it happened, although she thinks 1982. She doesnt know who owned the house where the party took place, or how she got there or how she got home. It is impossible to disentangle with certainty what may or may not have happened in the early 1980s. Maybe Ford fabricated the entire story, although she told a therapist in 2012 about such an incident. Maybe her memory is faulty, as happens more than we realize. Maybe there was a drunken encounter that she only later came to consider a trauma. Or maybe what she alleges really took place. What Ford describes is monstrous behavior, by any account. She says that Kavanaugh pushed her into a bedroom and onto a bed, held her down and tried to rape her, and put his hand over her mouth to muffle her screams. He and a friend were laughing, before his friend stopped Kavanaugh (the friend denies the incident took place). This is not a drunken escapade but a callous, calculated criminal assault. If someone is capable of such a thing, even as a teenager, it is a black mark against his character. And character is usually destiny. It is no accident that the men taken down by #MeToo are invariably repeat offenders. Not only is there no other allegation against Kavanaugh, the assault charge runs against everything we know about his personal and professional life, as attested by everyone who has known him. His exemplary reputation, earned over the course of decades and a matter of public record, should outweigh a charge that is unproven and, as far we know, unprovable. The confirmation process for the Supreme Court has long been badly broken, a forum for sheer blood sport. If, based on what we know now, this accusation keeps Kavanaugh from the Court, it will be a new low. The Senate will have embraced a new world where the existence of an allegation, regardless of whether it can be proven, is enough to stop a nominee and destroy his good name.  2018 by King Features Syndicate IN THE NEWS: [WATCH] Kavanaugh Accuser Goes Public NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.

After three decades in the field of judicial appointments, I thought I had seen pretty much everything. I thought too soon. Last week, Public Policy Polling conducted a survey of voters in Maine regarding the Kavanaugh nomination. Maine is on the radar screen because some say that Republican senator Susan Collins is among the handful who will determine whether Kavanaugh is confirmed. Survey question 8 read: Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh will likely support the Trump Administration position on a lawsuit which would strike down healthcare protections for people with preexisting conditions. Does learning this make you more likely or less likely to support confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court, or does it not make a difference? What? This has to be one of the most manipulative poll questions ever asked about a judicial nominee. First, it is not based on anything Kavanaugh has actually done, written, or said, but on a hypothetical. Thats not automatically bad, but the question asserts as fact what is, in fact, mere speculation. Second, this question offers a mere sentence fragment  and a distorted one at that  about the lawsuit it mentions, implying that this lawsuit actually targets Obamacares requirement of coverage for people with pre-existing medical conditions. It doesnt. NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis. Third, the question obviously promotes the view that judges should be appointed based on which side will likely win in certain kinds of cases. Thats like hiring an umpire based on which teams he will favor during the upcoming season. Rarely have so many flaws been packed into a single poll question. At the end of the day, the conflict over judicial appointments boils down to a conflict over judicial power. Should judges take the power to make law away from the American people and their elected representatives? Certainly Americas Founders didnt design the judiciary to operate that way. Unfortunately, the American peoples understanding of our system of government and the judicial branchs place in that system is less than optimal. After all, 12 percent think the Constitution protects the right to own a pet, and 22 percent believe that the three branches of government are the Democrat, Republican, and Independent branches. Ten percent of college graduates say that Judge Judy currently serves on the U.S. Supreme Court. One-third cant name any branch of government, and nearly 40 percent cant identify any rights actually protected by the First Amendment. Its scandalous that pollsters would aggravate this feeble understanding by using blatantly misleading questions about Judge Brett Kavanaugh. A Supreme Court nominee deserves better  even if he will not be sharing the bench with Judge Judy. NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.

Senator Richard Blumenthal (D., Conn.) called on Grassley to adjourn the hearing so committee members would have the opportunity to review a new batch of documents on Kavanaugh released late Monday night.

Kavanaugh is the kind of judge Americans want on the Supreme Court, the chairman added, and Democrats have tactic after tactic to delay and obstruct his confirmation. The effort by Democrats to delay the confirmation was reportedly a coordinated effort led by Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer.  The Senate was just given an additional 42,000 pages of Kavanaugh documents the NIGHT BEFORE his confirmation hearing. This underscores just how absurd this process is. Not a single senator will be able to review these records before tomorrow.

								Kavanaugh to Give Senate Calendar Supporting Denial of Allegations							
 Brett Kavanaugh acquitted himself ably in his confirmation hearings last week, which is surely one reason that Democrats have resorted to a contemptible attack on him as guilty of federal crimes. Democrats are smearing the nominee as a perjurer. There are three main allegations, and each is laughably frivolous. First, critics have accused him of lying under oath when he said in Senate testimony in 2004 that he was not involved in handling William Pryors nomination to the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit because various documents indicate that he played some role in supporting Pryors quest for confirmation. To make the perjury claim, activists rip two words (not involved) not just out of context from his larger testimony, but out of context from the sentence itself. Some background is necessary. In the George W. Bush administration, different lawyers in the White House counsels office were assigned different circuits as their primary responsibility. They handled only nominations within that portfolio. That did not mean that they had no involvement at all with other nominations, only that those nominations werent their ultimate responsibility. It turns out that Kavanaugh explained much of this to the Senate. He clearly said that he was not assigned the Pryor nomination, but he also said that he may have helped the nomination in other ways, including by attending a moot-court session. In other words, he never testified that he was not involved at all in the Pryor nomination, just that it was not his to handle. Simply put, there is simply no credible argument that this was anything other than truthful testimony. Its a partisan smear spread to partisan hacks who either dont know or dont care about the governing legal standards. And so is the next perjury claim, that he lied about his knowledge of memogate, an old and largely forgotten controversy from George W. Bushs first term. A former Republican Senate staffer, Manuel Miranda, took confidential Democratic documents from a shared server. As Above the Law founder David Lat explained in an invaluable Twitter thread, Miranda exploited a glitch to gain access to Democratic communications and Democratic strategies. At issue is the classic Washington question: What did Kavanaugh know, and when did he know it? During Kavanaughs Senate testimony in 2004, Orrin Hatch asked him if he had received any documents that appeared to you to have been drafted or prepared by Democratic staff members of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Kavanaugh said no. In 2006, Ted Kennedy asked him about the same documents, and Kavanaugh issued another denial, saying, I dont know what the universe of memos might be, but I do know that I never received any memos, was not aware of any such memos. At the same time, however, Kavanaugh was careful to say that he might have unknowingly seen information derived from the memos. So, to be clear, to demonstrate perjury the Democrats would have to show clearly and unequivocally that Kavanaugh didnt just see information taken from the memos but that he clearly and knowingly viewed the actual memos themselves. So, whats the evidence that Kavanaugh lied? Try not to laugh. First, and most damaging is an email with the subject header spying from an entirely different staffer  Barbara Ledeen  who claims she had a friend who is a mole for us on the Left. Whats missing from that email? Any memoranda from Miranda. Indeed, theres no communication from Miranda at all, just purported inside information from a friend across the aisle. Gossipy insider info is routinely exchanged in Washington, and the nature of the information in the email  regarding multi-million dollar contributions  hardly screams secret! And thats the alleged smoking gun. As for the rest of the alleged evidence? It consists of emails that, on their face, showed no indications that they contained stolen information. And lets go back to Kavanaughs key, allegedly incriminating statement. While hedging that he doesnt know what the universe of memos might be, he also says, I never received any memos. There is not a single email or document showing that he actually received a stolen memo, much less that he did so knowingly. The evidence of perjury is so lacking that even a panel of experts convened by Vox concluded that there was no crime. Professor Miriam Baer of Brooklyn Law School put her objection bluntly. I dont see any lie, she said. She cant see any lie because there was no lie. Finally, there is also a bizarre claim circulating that Kavanaugh lied under oath in his previous testimony about his role in Bush-era detainee-treatment policies. In 2002, Kavanaugh was involved in a contentious meeting about detainees and was apparently asked how Justice Kennedy would likely rule on the question of whether unlawful enemy combatants should be granted access to counsel. Democrats  namely Dick Durbin  have cried foul, claiming that this involvement conflicts with his previous testimony that he was not involved in the questions in the rules governing detention of combatants. And what were the questions? Once again, the invaluable David Lat has the relevant details. 5. Compare @SenatorDurbin's excerpt from Kavanaugh's 2006 testimony (left) with my much larger excerpt from the testimony (right). pic.twitter.com/RQ3c7xbJyo  David Lat (@DavidLat) September 10, 2018  The questions involved specific abusive interrogation techniques  techniques that no one claims Kavanaugh helped craft and that Kavanaugh has testified he wasnt read into. Durbin is ripping Kavanaughs answer completely out of context. Not one of these perjury allegations passes the most basic test of actual criminality, yet  aside from Voxs admirable and honest reservations  the vaunted fact-checkers of the mainstream media have remained silent. The online Left is filling the void with angry denunciations of anyone  including respected Brookings fellow and Lawfare editor-in-chief Benjamin Wittes  who dares fairly analyze the law and the facts and reach the only reasonable conclusion: Brett Kavanaugh did not commit perjury. There is one final irony in this sad tale of a failed smear. Many of the same people who helped the bogus perjury claims go viral then turned around and spread a blatant lie about Kavanaugh  that he called contraceptives abortion-inducing drugs. ICYMI: Brett Kavanaugh referred to birth control as ""abortion-inducing drugs"" in his confirmation hearing. #StopKavanaugh pic.twitter.com/hnRnm9bI2A  NARAL (@NARAL) September 9, 2018  False. If you watch the very video that NARAL attaches, he was clearly and plainly stating the position of Priests for Life, the plaintiff in the case, not his own position. The old Bob Dole line is apt in all this: Stop lying about Brett Kavanaughs record. But Democrats arent going to do that, because the lies are all that they have.

His tenure has been momentous. Most visibly, following the confirmation of Neil Gorsuch and assuming the probability that Kavanaugh is confirmed, McGahn will have shepherded the selection and confirmation to the high court of two of the best qualified, committed constitutionalists on the federal benchjudges who recognize that the best way unelected judges can safeguard representative democracy is to interpret the Constitution according to the original public meaning of its text. At least as remarkable has been that, even amid the difficult process of filling two Supreme Court vacancies, 59 other Article III judgeships have been filled to date. This number includes the successful confirmation of 26 circuit court judges, which already surpasses by four the previous record for a presidents first two years (22 under the first President Bush) for court of appeals confirmationsand we are still almost five months away from the two-year mark of the Trump administration. Equally important, these circuit judges have with unprecedented consistency been very high caliber nominees who share a commitment to originalism and textualism. Collectively, whether looking at the Supreme Court specifically or at federal judgeships generally, no administration since the advent of modern constitutional debate has had a more impressive track record on judicial nominations than the Trump administration with Don McGahns stewardship. And consider that this occurred against the backdrop of a razor-thin Republican majority in the Senate, with Senate Democrats doing all they could to obstruct the process through the unprecedented abuse of cloture and blue slips. McGahn has also helped to oversee President Trumps much needed reining in of the administrative state. For years, the federal bureaucracy has been aggrandizing the power of its own unelected officials, too often acting like a virtual fourth branch of government and dealing a blow to the tripartite government our Constitution actually authorizes. Since last year, the administration has pursued a number of measures to curtail that trend, perhaps most prominently its efforts to roll back the notoriously profligate issuance of regulations by agencies, both through executive orders and by bringing to life the largely unused Congressional Review Act. Also significant: ending the use of court settlements and consent decrees to benefit third-party organizations not involved in litigation or to find back-door methods to impose nationwide rules; reclaiming accountability so that federal officials who underperform or engage in misconduct can more easily be removed; reducing inefficiency and increasing transparency in the relationship between labor unions and the civil service; and shifting the selection of administrative law judges from career bureaucrats to agency heads directly accountable to the president. Increasing accountability to the chief executive and other elected officials means increasing accountability to the people. Appointing originalists and textualists to the federal bench bodes well for preserving the individual rights and government structure on which our freedom depends for protection. All of this is a victory in the making for the Constitution and the rule of law. Don McGahn can stand proud for his role in helping to bring it about.

All rights reserved. All market data delayed 20 minutes. Kavanaugh accuser's attorneys want the Supreme Court nominee to speak first. Attorneys for Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who has accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault, asked the Senate Judiciary Commitee on Friday night for an additional day to make her decision to testify. Shortly before midnight Friday, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley tweeted that he had granted the extension, addressing the tweet to Kavanaugh. ""Judge Kavanaugh I just granted another extension to Dr Ford to decide if she wants to proceed w the statement she made last week to testify to the senate,"" Grassley wrote. ""She shld decide so we can move on I want to hear her. I hope u understand. Its not my normal approach to b indecisive."" Judge Kavanaugh I just granted another extension to Dr Ford to decide if she wants to proceed w the statement she made last week to testify to the senate  She shld decide so we can move on  I want to hear her.  I hope u understand.  Its not my normal approach to b indecisive Senate Republicans earlier Friday extended a counteroffer to Ford to testify on Capitol Hill next Wednesday, amid negotiations over whether she would elaborate on her allegations against Kavanaugh in public. Fox News was told that the Republican senators wanted an answer by the end of the day. In a statement released earlier Friday evening, Grassley had extended the deadline for a response to 10 p.m. If there was no response, or a rejection of the offer, Grassley said in a statement then, the committee may set a vote on Kavanaugh's nomination for Monday. But Ford's lawyer, Debra Katz, labeled the 10 p.m. deadline ""arbitrary."" ""Its sole purpose is to bully Dr. Ford and deprive her of the ability to make a considered decision that has life-altering implications for her and her family,"" Katz said in a statement. ""She has already been forced out of her home and continues to be subjected to harassment, hate mail, and death threats. Our modest request is that she be given an additional day to make her decision."" ""The imposition of aggressive and artificial deadlines regarding the date and conditions of any hearing has created tremendous and unwarranted anxiety and stress on Dr. Ford,"" Katz said. ""Your cavalier treatment of a sexual assault survivor who has been doing her best to cooperate with the Committee is completely inappropriate."" For their part, Democrats had reacted negatively to the Friday offer. U.S. Sen.Dianne Feinstein of California, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said Ford shouldnt be rushed, adding that Ford cant testify any earlier than Thursday. Show some heart, Feinstein said. Wait until Dr. Ford feels that she can come before the committee. Another Democrat on the judiciary committee, Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, said Ford deserved extra time to respond. After spending the day in FBI interviews about death threats against her, Dr. Blasey (sic) deserves the minimal decency of 24 hours to make a decision about testifying,"" Blumenthal wrote in a statement. ""Rejecting her request would take the Senate to a shameful new low  a blatant abuse of power. Republican colleagues have a moral and Constitutional duty to stop the ugly unacceptable bullying. Ford has accused Kavanaugh of attempting to rape her while both were in high school. Kavanaugh has denied the allegations. Grassley initially invited Ford to testify on Monday and gave Ford until 10 a.m. Friday to respond. That deadline passed Friday without a deal after Fords attorneys made clear this week Ford didnt want to testify Monday but suggested she would do so on another day. Meanwhile, President Trump on Friday called for Ford to testify, saying its time for the Senate to vote on Kavanaughs nomination. The president was also critical of Feinstein for receiving a letter from Ford outlining her allegations in July, but failing to disclose them, even anonymously, to federal officials or other committee members until last week. ""Senator Feinstein and the Democrats held the letter for months, only to release it with a bang after the hearings were OVER - done very purposefully to Obstruct & Resist & Delay,"" Trump tweeted Friday. ""Let her testify, or not, and TAKE THE VOTE!"" Trump also took issue with Fords legal team saying they want the FBI to investigate the allegations  something the bureau has indicated it has no plans to do. ""The radical left lawyers want the FBI to get involved NOW,"" Trump tweeted. ""Why didnt someone call the FBI 36 years ago?"" Kavanaugh, in a letter to the Judiciary Committee on Thursday, indicated he would be ready and willing to testify on Monday. ""I continue to want a hearing as soon as possible, so that I can clear my name,"" he wrote. ""Since the moment I first heard this allegation, I have categorically and unequivocally denied it. I remain committed to defending my integrity."" Matt Richardson is an editor for Fox News. Follow him on Twitter @MRichardson713.

McConnell: Kavanaugh Will Be on Supreme Court in 'Very Near Future' Hannity: Booker, Ellison Show Dems' 'Hypocrisy, Double Standard' on Kavanaugh Allegation  McCarthy said Democrats are using the allegations facing Kavanaugh to delay the confirmation process. ""As they see it, this is about the ideological bent of the Supreme Court, maybe for the next generation. And they are going to fight this tooth and nail to prevent Kavanaugh from being in that seat,"" McCarthy said. He said Kavanaugh is an eminently qualified candidate who has written 300 appellate opinions in a dozen years on theUnited States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. ""They have more than enough information to decide whether he's qualified to fill the seat or not,"" McCarthy said, adding that Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) should not allow the confirmation process to be further delayed by Democrats.  On ""Life, Liberty & Levin"" on Sunday, Mark Levin made a similar argument, claiming that Democrats have ""hijacked"" and ""destroyed"" the Supreme Court confirmation process over the past 30 years. He said Democrats for decades have attempted to stack state courts and the Supreme Court with ""progressive statists,"" because they believe in the centralization of government and they want issues nationalized. ""They can talk about people all they want, they can talk about women all they want, they can talk about 'all white men' all they want,"" Levin said.

WATCH: Kavanaugh Protesters Refuse to Denounce Keith Ellison Shapiro: 'Disgusting' for Dems to Turn Kavanaugh Controversy Into 'Get-Out-the-Vote Effort' George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley said it's impossible not to be troubled by the timing of these allegations, which come right after Kavanaugh's hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee were completed and right before the committee was set to vote to advance his nomination to the Senate floor. ""It really goes to: what is the burden? Not of these women coming forward or to be heard, but what's the burden for senators? There has to be a modicum of fairness for Brett Kavanaugh,"" Turley said. He explained that it's too easy and opportunistic to simply believe the accusers, as some Democrats have suggested.

Carson, who called sexual predators abominable, went on to liken the allegations against Kavanaugh to those Carson said he himself has faced during his career. He described an incident in which he was accused of fathering a child out of wedlock. He said he wasn't intimidated because ""I knew that the only woman I had ever slept with in my entire life was my wife.""

Susan Collins could send 50,000 women to jail for seeking abortions, should she vote to confirm President Trumps Supreme Court nominee. Alaskans are seeing the same stark ad in their papers targeting Sen. Lisa Murkowski  part of an advertising blitz by anti-Trump groups determined to block Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh from reaching the high court. Ms. Collins and Ms. Murkowski are both pro-choice, and they are the two GOP senators considered undecided in the Kavanaugh vote. If both can be swayed to oppose his nomination, Democrats believe they have a chance to win the fight and deliver a stinging defeat to the president. With the judges confirmation hearing done, the battle over his future has shifted to the states, where liberal and conservative groups want to make senators think long and hard before deciding how to vote. The reason were seeing so much activism around Kavanaugh, including media campaigns, is because he is one of the most troubling nominees in many years, said Dan Goldberg, legal director from the Alliance for Justice. The ad running in The Portland Press Herald puts the ramifications of the vote in stark terms: Susan Collins legacy: Total number of women jailed for seeking abortions passes 50,000 mark in 2032. Brett Kavanaughs record demonstrates that he would be a sure-fire vote to end Roe v. Wade, criminalize abortion and punish women, said Sasha Bruce, vice president at NARAL Pro Choice America, one of the groups behind the ad. Another group in Maine says it has raised more than $1 million in pledged donations to back an opponent to Ms. Collins should she vote to confirm the judge. Ms. Collins, though, called that the equivalent of an attempted bribe. This effort will not influence my vote at all, she told Newsmax. I think it demonstrates the new lows to which the judges opponents have stooped. Conservatives are running their own ads targeting a handful of Democrats in red states won by Mr. Trump in 2016 who are considered up for grabs in the Kavanaugh vote. Top targets are Sens. Joe Manchin III in West Virginia, Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota and Joe Donnelly in Indiana. All three broke with their party last year and voted to confirm Justice Neil M. Gorsuch, Mr. Trumps first nominee to the high court, and the conservative groups message is its time to do that again. Red state Democrats like Sens. Manchin, Heitkamp, and Donnelly have a choice: vote yes on President Trumps nominee or vote no and stand with Chuck Schumer and the left wing extremists in their party, said Carrie Severino, chief counsel for the Judicial Crisis Network, whose group has spent roughly $2 million running ads in the three states. The GOP candidates in those races also are attacking the senators. In West Virginia, Republican Patrick Morrisey is running an ad saying Mr. Manchin wants a pro-choice Supreme Court justice. Manchin says he is pro-life, but seems to only want a pro-abortion Supreme Court justice. Does Manchin back abortion on demand up to the day of birth? Liberal lyin Joe has got to go, the ad says. Abortion has been a dominant theme for both sides. The coalition behind the newspaper ads in Maine and Alaska says it decided to run them after the confirmation hearings, when Democrats highlighted an email the judge wrote during his time as a lawyer in the Bush White House. In that email he questioned a colleague who had called the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision settled law, and said at least some Supreme Court justices would be willing to overturn it. Democrats said that sounded like someone with an antipathy toward the landmark decision, and the advocacy groups then calculated how many women they believe would be put in jail for violating abortion laws, should Roe be overturned. Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski want their legacies to be as independent-minded moderates. But if they support Kavanaugh, their legacies will be jailing thousands of women, said Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, one of the organizations behind the ads. The advocates say the 50,000 figure is a conservative estimate and is based off half of 1 percent of women who currently seek abortions. Copyright  2018 The Washington Times, LLC.

Or maybe you noticed some of the 200-plus people protesting to the point of being arrested in DC. But beyond the headline-grabbing antics, the hearings looked to some like an exercise in empty stagecraft: a chance for Republicans enabling the madness of the Trump presidency to confirm a qualified conservative to the Supreme Court, while the Democrats on the Judiciary Committee got their highlight-reel moments to appease a raging Resistance movement.  That was what happened with the aw-shucks routine put on by Neil Gorsuch last year, and this go-around, there is somehow even less suspense. Kavanaugh will almost certainly be confirmed to replace the court's nominal swing voter Anthony Kennedy, who announced his retirement this summer. Since the GOP has a majority in the Senate, Republican senators would have to turn on him to block his confirmation, which seems unlikelyeven though a recently-unearthed 2003 email suggesting Kavanaugh thought Roe v. Wade might not be ""settled law"" made it seem even more clear that the pivotal 1973 ruling establishing a woman's right to an abortion would be in dire jeopardy if and when he's on the court. (In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh did in fact refer to Roe as ""settled law,"" though the pro-choice folks sending thousands of coat hangers to the office of Maine Senator Susan Collinsa potential swing votewere likely less than reassured.) But you don't have to be the kind of activist who gets arrested on C-SPAN to have cause for grave alarm at the prospect of Kavanaugh joining four other diehard right-wingers in a majority atop the US judicial system. He's written key opinions and dissents on a host of topics shaping the world we live in, establishing deeply conservative views on everything from voting rights to net neutrality to immigrants to executive power. That's to say nothing of his long history of writing and saying things that suggest presidents might be above the law, and fashioning a legal philosophy that seems to leave out entire segments of society. ""He's a catastrophe for people of color,"" Jeff Hauser, executive director of the Revolving Door Project, a good-government group at the left-leaning Center for Economic and Policy Research who has written critically of the potential justice on everything from weed to impeachment, told me. It's hard to overstate the stakes here: If confirmed, Kavanaugh will long outlast Trumpand could potentially form part of a right-wing bloc that strikes down progressive legislation pushed by future Democratic presidents and congresses. In addition to the threat he represents on reproductive rights andin the short-termthe Mueller probe, Kavanaugh would also be likely to haunt efforts at slowing climate change, protecting labor and workers' rights, and passing gun control bills. The worst-case scenario here is that he turns the court into a far-right stronghold that overrules reforms favored by a majority of the country's voters for decades. This is what that might look like. It didn't take long after Kavanaugh's nomination for speculation to explode that Trump might have tried to secure some kind of explicit promise he'd protect him in the massive Russia investigationor just oversight generallyshould it reach the Supreme Court. There's a broad consensus in the legal community that Kavanaugh, who worked on the Ken Starr investigation of Bill Clinton, is particularly high on presidential power and deference to the executive branch. Among other things, he's argued presidents are essentially too busy to deal with criminal indictments and should be protected from them by new legislation. On the one hand, that suggests he theoretically thinks presidents are vulnerable to indictment as the law stands. But the thrust of his words in a 2009 Minnesota Law Review articlepresidents, he argued, ought to be ""excused from some of the burdens of ordinary citizenship"" like responding to civil and criminal claimshave raised ire on the left, especially given he previously signaled he thought presidents actually could not be indicted, period, at least while in office. After all, Trump is facing ongoing litigation charging he defamed a woman he allegedly sexually harassed, not to mention the Mueller probe.  ""Executive privilege is basically a made-up right asserted by presidents of both parties to hide stuff from Congress and the Courts,"" Hauser told me. ""That could be particularly relevant when, for instance, Congress subpoenas Trump's tax returns. I don't think Trump will give up those tax returns unless a larger army takes them physically."" It should be noted that some scholars in the legal community are cautiously optimistic about the guy when it comes to protecting MuellerKavanaugh reportedly expressed a degree of approval for the special counsel's appointment when meeting privately with senators on Capitol Hill. Noah Feldman, a Harvard legal historian who knows Kavanaugh personally, told me recently that the judge plausibly fits the profile of a ""Never Trump"" conservative. ""If he were confirmed, he would owe Donald Trump zero,"" Feldman told me. ""This is someone who [for] most of his career was as a Bush conservative."" But even if there was no explicit deal between the president and Kavanaugh arranging for the former's protection by the latter, Kavanaugh's time in the Bush White Houseknown for its abuses of executive powerand his past suggestion that maybe Nixon shouldn't have had to turn over the notorious tapes that implicated him have watchdogs worried. (Kavanaugh did praise the decision in question, United States v. Nixon, as ""one of the greatest moments in American judicial history"" at his confirmation hearings, which is either a reflection of the nuances of his views or else a bit of posturing on a sensitive subject.) ""Kavanaugh was not the safe pick,"" Hauser told me of his nomination, arguing the president went with a more difficult judge to confirm because Kavanaugh would be likelier to protect Trump. ""It's extremely difficult to imagine he was chosen for any other reason. His Minnesota Law Review piece was really extreme."" The state of environmental regulation in America is already a disaster, and experts increasingly panicked about pending climate catastrophe think Kavanaugh would make things even worse. His legal history makes him seem like someone who would be incredibly skeptical of efforts to use existing federal agencies and laws to protect the planet. This is important because, for starters, Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency, the key 2007 Supreme Court decision giving the EPA authority to regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act, was a 5-4 decision. ""He's willing to admit that climate change is a problem. But he's said, 'Leave it to Congress,' knowing full well that Congress is so deadlocked that it's not going to do anything about the issue,"" Robert Percival, director of the Environmental Law Program at the University of Maryland, told me.  Percival argued Kavanaugh had come up with strange, novel ways to kill environmental regulations, specifically noting a ruling of his killing interstate air pollution regulation was actually overturned by the Supreme Courtand not in a 5-4 vote, but a 6-2 one. So while coal companies enjoy a federal environmental regulatory apparatus run by their own former lobbyist, even a future president and Congress more determined to reverse planetary disaster might find themselves handcuffed by a court with him on it, Percival warned. ""His confirmation to the court would be very bad news for the future,"" he told me. Like passing new climate regulations, actual legislation reining in gun violence is hard to imagine right now. But even if the political winds blow differently, a Justice Kavanaugh would be a huge obstacle to reform. ""He is clearly on the record expressing the view that it is illegal to restrict access to assault weapons like the one used in Parkland,"" Adam Skaggs, chief counsel at the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, told me. ""He has made fairly clear that he believes regulating who can carry concealed weapons in public is constitutionally suspect. And he has outlined a view of how courts should approach Second Amendment questions that would call into question a host of the types of laws legislatures in many states have passed after Parkland."" Whether it's banning bump stocks to extreme-risk protection orders to keep potential shooters off the street to even laws that keep guns out of the hands of domestic abusers, Kavanaugh's philosophy suggests he might look skeptically on all of them. According to Skaggs, and as reflected in his 2011 dissent in Heller v. District of Columbia where he cited the centrality of ""text, history, and tradition"" in deciding gun policy, he's a classic originalist in at least one respect: He really does seem to think gun laws should fit the environment of the Republic's founding in the 1780s, when tri-corner hats and muskets were the stuff of life. ""His views are plainly outside the mainstream even of traditional conservative judges,"" Skaggs argued. ""In angling for a seat on the Supreme Court, he has been among the most enthusiastic of the choir singing from the NRA hymnal. Anyone who is concerned with public safety and gun safety should be absolutely alarmed by the prospect of him casting decisive votes on these issues on the Supreme Court."" The pre-Kavanaugh court has already been notably hostile to unions. In June, a 5-4 decision in Janus v. AFSCME pulled the rug out from under public-sector unions across the country, giving free riders who don't want to contribute to collective bargaining a green light to sit back and let their coworkers struggle on their behalf. (At the same time, Janus will likely severely weaken the power of unions to bargain.) That came after another 5-4 decision about a month earlier in Epic Systems Corp vs. Lewis saying class-action lawsuits by workers can be banned as a condition of employment. That makes it way easier for bosses to lock in egregious conditions at the time you start, preventing you from seeking redress over anything from withheld pay to sexual harassment. ""If you had to imagine a nightmare term on the Supreme Court for the rights and strength of American workers, this would be it,"" Benjamin Sachs, an expert on labor at Harvard Law School, told me, noting Justice Kennedy wasn't exactly an ally of the labor movement as it stands. Suffice it to say Brett Kavanaugh is probably on board with all of that and then some. ""I read through the 50-some work-law cases in which Judge Kavanaugh wrote an opinion and came away with the distinct impression that he sees the world through employers' eyes rather than employees' eyes,"" said Charlotte Garden, a law professor at the University of Seattle.  The timing could not be worse. Forces of the anti-union movement have been encouraged by Janus and other decisions, according to Garden, and are now mounting challenges across the country in hopes of further eroding workers' ability to advocate for themselves while on the job. ""Some of those cases involve what could be an existential threat to some unions in that they call for unions to have to reimburse employees for back dues and fees,"" she told me. Multiple labor experts I canvassed mentioned Kavanaugh's decision in what's referred to as the Agriprocessors case, where he basically argued undocumented people aren't really workers in a dispute that saw a boss use his employees' legal status to try to kill their union. But Garden also cited the judge's opinion in a case involving a worker killed by a whale at Seaworld, where his ruling suggested he believes federal labor protections shouldn't apply to jobs that are highly risky but also desirable. Among other things, Kavanaugh compared the dangers of working with whales to being a baseball player taking fast pitches and doing stunts for movies, and said society should not ""paternalistically decide that the participants in these sports and entertainment activities must be protected from themselves."" ""Increasingly employers are figuring out how to force their workers to carry business risks,"" Garden told me. ""And even in a Democratic administration in which agencies or Congress try to respond to that trend by, for example, forcing employers to characterize their workers as employees or independent contractors, that might be the kind of situation where we see the more conservative members of the Supreme Court take a different view."" In other words, the way labor law has been heading in this countryand the way we actually work and what jobs look like now and what they might resemble soonare reasons to be deeply afraid of what making a living might be like in an America where Kavanaugh is a justice. Whether it's the Janus decision being extended to private-sector unions, new assaults on immigrant workers' few rights, or some kind of innovative First Amendment claim that workers can't be exclusively represented by a union, don't for a second be fooled into thinking the shit economy you're in couldn't start to look positively decent in hindsight. When Sachs summed up the dangers Kavnaugh posed to workers' rights, he could also have been speaking about the general impact his confirmation might have on young people for years to come. ""Just because it's terrible doesn't mean it couldn't get worse,"" he told me.  Sign up for our newsletter to get the best of VICE delivered to your inbox daily.  Follow Matt Taylor on Twitter.

Though nearly all Democrats in the Senate had voiced opposition to him, the Republican majority was palpably eager to install another conservative justice on the court, where he could help push the country's laws to the right for the next generation. But Kavanaugh's path to a lifetime appointment has become more difficult since a woman named Christine Blasey Ford said he sexually assaulted her at a party in high school 36 years ago. The accusation, which Ford raised to her local congresswoman and then passed along in a letter to Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein before going public this week, has been strongly denied by Kavanaugh. This controversy may just be beginning, however, with both Kavanaugh and Ford (who had told a therapist about the incident in 2012) indicating Monday they were willing to testify before the Senate. The question hovering above all this is whether the allegation will torpedo Kavanaugh's nomination. He stands accused of a violent crime at a time of heightened awareness of sexual violence across the world, and while Anita Hill accusing Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment famously failed to fell him in 1991, previous Supreme Court nominations had been scuttled by something as minor as a history of pot use. Then again, given the conservative movement's support for his appointment, it won't be easy for opponents to slow Kavanaugh's push for power to a halt. It could happen, though. Here's how. For a long time, the norm in the Senate was to vote through pretty much any qualified candidate to the Supreme Court. Even after Robert Bork was blocked in 1987 for his right-wing views, the Senate routinely confirmed justices on a bipartisan basis. But confirmation fights have been getting more politically charged since then, and Republicans launched the Senate into a new era in 2016, when they refused to even give Barack Obama's pick Merrick Garland a hearing. The Senate is now narrowly divided 5149, and if Democrats uniformly opposed Kavanaugh, it would only take two defections for his nomination to go down. Alaska's Lisa Murkowski and Maine's Susan Collins are seen as the most moderate and independent-minded among GOP senators and both have voiced at least some support for hearings into Ford's accusation. They've been joined by Arizona's Jeff Flake and Tennessee's Bob Corker, both Republicans who are retiring from the Senate and therefore insulated from demands made by the pro-Trump conservative base. It's a big step from ""we need to hear more before we vote"" to actually voting no on Kavanaugh and risking the consequences of breaking from their party. But depending on how things play out, it's possible that these Republicans reject him. (Of these Republicans, only Flake is on the Judiciary Committee, but the full Senate vote, not the committee vote, is what determines Kavanaugh's fate.) There's also the question of how Democratic senators facing tough reelection fights will vote on Kavanaugh. Before the assault accusation surfaced, they were in a tricky position: They didn't want to be seen as occupying space as far to the left as their more liberal colleagues, and may not have seen much value in denouncing Kavanaugh if he was going to be rubber-stamped by the Republican majority anyway. But if public support for the judge drops in the wake of Ford's allegation, that could provide them with political cover to sink him. The blockade of Garland's nomination may have established a new precedent: If the Senate is controlled by the party opposing the president, why should those senators even consider confirming the other party's Supreme Court nominations? Though Democrats would have to win several tough elections in red states to retake the Senate, it's at least a possibility. If Kavanaugh isn't confirmed by the end of the year, Republicans may have missed their chance to get another justice on the court.  That means the GOP will likely be trying to speed through additional hearings and investigations, while Democrats do what little they can to delay, creating an environment where they can at least argue the GOP is not taking Ford seriously, and connect Kavanaugh to other high-profile conservatives accused of sexual assault, including Donald Trump himself. (Perhaps cognizant of that danger, White House aide Kellyanne Conway has publicly insisted Kavanaugh's accuser ""should be heard."") Meanwhile, Republicans could try to use the specter of a Democratic Senate blocking their judges to inspire the base to come out to vote in the November midterms. If a Supreme Court seat is up for grabs in the Senate elections, it'll raise the stakes even further on an already high-stakes midterm contest, one that was expected to be about resistance to Trump as much as anything else. Given all of the above, it seems like there is an easy way out for Republicans: Just find another judge. Kavanaugh was obviously Trump's preferred pickpossibly because of his stance on investigations of the presidentbut he's not uniquely qualified; there's a literal list of judges who would have extremely similar views on a whole range of issues. The White House is currently standing behind Kavanaugh, but that might change if Republican senators waver on the nomination. A fresh nominee would have to be vetted and go through the Judicial Committee hearing process, but the GOP could likely rush that along before the end of the year, even if it meant breaking a few norms along the way. It might be seen as a defeat for Trump initially, but at the end of the day he'd wind up with an anti-abortion, pro-employer, anti-regulation Supreme Court justice, just as he would have if Kavanaugh sailed through.  By sticking with Kavanaugh, Trump and his allies are betting they can either confirm him by January, when new senators are sworn in, or else retain the Senate. Both of those are likely outcomes at this pointbut also far from sure things. If they are wrong on both counts, get used to having eight justices on the Supreme Court.

Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., on Thursday threw a cryptic curveball at Brett Kavanaugh, insinuating the Supreme Court nominee could be guilty of a crime even as Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee seek to delay his confirmation. The vague accusation comes after the Senate Judiciary Committee already grilled Kavanaugh and other witnesses and prepares to vote on sending his nomination to the full Senate. The White House blasted the ambiguous charge as a last minute gambit. I have received information from an individual concerning the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, Feinstein said in her surprise statement. That individual strongly requested confidentiality, declined to come forward or press the matter further, and I have honored that decision. I have, however, referred the matter to federal investigative authorities. A spokesperson for Feinstein declined Fox News request to elaborate on the lawmakers statement, but there has been much speculation that she is referring to a secret letter that has been the subject of intrigue on Capitol Hill over the last few days. A source familiar with the confirmation proceedings told Fox News that Feinstein received the letter back in July, but did not make its existence known publicly until Thursday.  Kavanaugh responds to 1,287 written questions from senators - Fox News: The Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday released Supreme Court Nominee Brett Kavanaughs responses to over 1,200 questions submitted by mostly Senate Democrats following his four-day hearings earlier this month. Kavanaughs responses, which amounted to more than 260 pages, answered the senators questions on topics that ranged from abortion, executive power and his personal finances. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., took to questioning Kavanaughs stance on abortion after he reportedly said in a 2003 email that he considered Roe v. Wade to be settled law, an answer she considered to be too vague.  He also addressed a similar question to Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, saying that the email commented on the views of legal scholars. It did not describe my own views.

Like other fermented foods such as sourdough, kombucha, and kimchi, cheese is the product of bacteria and yeast, plus mold. Cheese is mostly coagulated milk, but adding a unique culture of microbes determines its texture and flavor. In the cheeses thick exterior rind, microbes teem, jockey, and help create a covering to keep in moisture. Microbiologist Benjamin Wolfes lab at Tufts University studies how bacteria and fungi interact in the small ecosystems of cheese (compared with the wild worlds inside the human gut or a scoop of soil). Theres a war and peace happening on these cheese rinds, says Wolfe. Understanding what influences the microbes behavior will illuminate how to manipulate and engineer them. That could lead to more effective pharmaceuticals, new ways of inoculating crops from disease, even a future of microbes colonizing other planets. Not to mention better cheese.

LISTEN AND SUBSCRIBE  FOX POLL: BLACKBURN UP THREE IN TENNESSEE SENATE RACE  Fox News: President Trump won Tennessee by 26 percentage points, and he remains popular in the Volunteer State. By a 20-point margin, Tennessee voters approve of the job hes doing (58-38 percent), and by an 8-point margin, more say their vote in the Senate race will be to express support for the president (35 percent) rather than opposition to him (27 percent). That helps Republican Marsha Blackburn top Democrat Phil Bredesen, yet its surprisingly close given Trumps wide win two years ago. Blackburn gets 47 percent to Bredesens 44 percent in the race to fill the states open Senate seat, according to a Fox News poll of Tennessee likely voters. Her three-point advantage is within the polls margin of sampling error. The candidates are vying to fill the seat of retiring Republican Sen. Bob Corker. Eighty-one percent of Bredesens backers feel certain they will vote for him compared to 74 percent for Blackburn. Overall, one in five say they could switch their pick before November.  Fox Poll: McCaskill up in Missouri Senate race by a whisker - Fox News: Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill, a two-term incumbent, tops her Republican challenger Josh Hawley by a narrow 44-41 percent margin, according to a Fox News poll of Missouri likely voters. Her three-point edge is within the polls margin of sampling error. Third-party candidates get six percent. While women back McCaskill by nine, the candidates are tied among white women. Men go for Hawley by four points. Suburban women support McCaskill by 14 points, while white evangelical Christians prefer Hawley by 34. McCaskill gets stronger support among Democrats, 90 percent, than Hawley captures among Republicans (79 percent). Missouri voters are more likely to identify as Republican than Democrat by seven points.  Fox Poll: Republican ahead of incumbent Democrat in Indiana Senate race - Fox News: President Trump remains popular in Indiana, a state he won by 19 percentage points -- and thats bad news for incumbent Democrat Sen. Joe Donnelly. A Fox News poll of Indiana likely voters shows Republican challenger Mike Braun ahead of Donnelly by 45-43 percent. Libertarian Lucy Brenton captures three percent and eight percent are undecided. The result is far from certain. Brauns two-point edge is within the polls margin of sampling error, and one in three voters say they could change their mind before Election Day. The poll, released Wednesday, finds 54 percent approve of the job the presidents doing, and twice as many say their financial situation is better rather than worse compared to two years ago (37 vs. 18 percent). Meanwhile, 33 percent say they will cast their Senate vote to show support for the president, while 31 percent say it will be to express opposition.  Fox Poll: Republican challenger ahead in North Dakota Senate race - Fox News: Republican Kevin Cramer tops incumbent Democrat Sen. Heidi Heitkamp among North Dakota likely voters by 48-44 percent, in a Fox News poll released Wednesday. Cramers edge in the Senate race is within the polls margin of sampling error. Both Heitkamp (85 percent) and Cramer supporters (84 percent) have a fairly high degree of vote certainty. Overall, 15 percent say they may change their mind before voting in November. Theres a wide gender gap, as women prefer Heitkamp by 7 points, and men back Cramer by 15 points. He also gets strong support from white evangelical Christians (+30) and voters prioritizing the economy (+36). Heitkamp comes out on top by 49 points among health care voters. Health care is the top issue for North Dakota voters (30 percent), followed by the economy (18 percent).  NEW YORKERS HIT THE POLLS TO DECIDE CUOMO VS. NIXON  NYT: New York voters head to the polls on Thursday as an unusual season of primaries, marked by surprise victories and insurgent candidacies, moves to an end. Voters will choose their partys nominees for governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general and the State Legislature  and theres more intrigue than normal. The intrigue starts at the top: Can Cynthia Nixon defy the polls and deprive Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of a third nomination? The race for the Democratic nomination for attorney general in New York  a contest to decide who will inherit ongoing lawsuits and inquiries into President Trump  is a tossup, according to the polls. Even the logistics are complicated. New York has a split primary system where federal primaries are held in June but state and local primaries occur in September. This years primary is on a Thursday, rather than a Tuesday, because of Rosh Hashana, the Jewish holiday, and the anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Finally, check your watches: In much of upstate New York, except for near Buffalo, polls do not open until noon; downstate, polls open at 6 a.m. All sites close at 9 p.m., according to the State Board of Elections. Raimondo wins big in Rhode Island - RIPR: Rhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo dealt her detractors a blow by scoring an unexpectedly big win in a primary election Wednesday, cruising past Democratic challenger Matt Brown by almost 24 points, according to unofficial results, while Cranston Mayor Allan Fung notched a decisive 16-point win over his closest GOP rival, Patricia Morgan. The results set the stage for a November rematch of the key contestants from 2014, when Raimondo beat Fung by slightly more than 4 points. Raimondo has been a polarizing figure since she spearheaded an overhaul as state treasurer of Rhode Island's pension system in 2011. While she argued that changes were necessary for the health of the pension system, many public employees and retirees remain upset about changes to their benefits.  Espy puts money on Miss. Senate runoff - McClatchy: Mike Espy is running for the runoff  the sort of election that some African Americans have said for years is designed to keep them from winning. Espy, President Bill Clintons agriculture secretary and a former congressman, is counting on Mississippis runoff election system in his bid to become the ruby red states first African American U.S. senator since Reconstruction and its first Democratic senator in nearly four decades. The runoff is baked into Espys campaign strategy against Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith and conservative firebrand Chris McDaniel, Republicans who hell face in a so-called jungle primary special election Nov. 6 to finish the final two years of GOP Sen. Thad Cochrans six-year term. Cochran retired in April citing health reasons, and Hyde-Smith was named to replace him until the election determined a successor. If none of the candidates receive 50 percent of the vote on Nov. 6, the top two finishers will square off in a Nov. 27 runoff with possible national implications. If one party winds up with a 50-49 edge Nov. 6, the Mississippi contest could determine who controls the Senate when it convenes in January.  Cyclist who gave Trump the finger now running for local office - WaPo: Juli Briskman, the cyclist who flashed her middle finger at President Trumps motorcade  and lost her job at a government contracting firm as a result  is parlaying an act of resistance into a run for local office in Northern Virginia. The 51-year-old marketing executive said this week she will file the paperwork to challenge Suzanne M. Volpe, a Republican who represents the Algonkian District on the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors in 2019. The county reliably votes for Democrats at the state and federal level, but Republicans maintain control of the board, 6 to 3, and Republicans have represented the county in Congress for nearly 40 years.  POLLS SHOW CLOSE RACES IN THE HOUSE NYT: With just under two months until the midterms, the races that seem likely to decide control of Congress remain strikingly close, according to a first wave of New York Times Upshot/Siena College polls. To take over the House, Democrats need to wrest at least 23 individual districts from Republican control. Weve started surveying dozens of the most competitive districts and have finished polls in nine: seven tossup districts and two districts that lean Republican, according to the Cook Political Report. In the seven tossup races, the result was within one point in five of them, though Democrats claimed a nine-point lead in Minnesotas Third, where the incumbent, Erik Paulsen, trailed the Democrat, Dean Phillips, 51 percent to 42 percent. Republicans had an eight-point polling lead in each of the two races thought to lean Republican. A close race in these contests is no surprise. Indeed, we asked Dave Wasserman of the Cook Political Report for his expected results in these races, before we conducted the survey. On average, neither the Democrats nor the Republicans did better than expected. The Cook Political Report characterizes the Democrats as substantial favorites to win control. Still, at this stage, theres little hard evidence indicating that either party has claimed a clear and consistent edge.  But the Senate is looking more blue - Bloomberg: Once seen as a scant possibility, Democratic hopes of retaking the U.S. Senate have brightened with just eight weeks left before the midterm elections. The shifting fortunes are starkly illustrated in Texas, where Senator Ted Cruz is confronting surprisingly strong competition from Democratic Representative Beto ORourke.  In another sign of Democratic momentum, two incumbents in states Trump carried overwhelmingly -- Joe Manchin in West Virginia and Joe Donnelly in Indiana -- have shown strength in some recent polls that make them seem better bets for re-election. At the same time, Democrats have a chance to pull off upsets in states once thought safely in the Republican column, particularly in deep-red Tennessee where popular former governor Phil Bredesen is running ahead in polls.  Dems continue to spend big money on TV ads - Daily Beast: Recent primary victories by underfunded Democratic candidates have prompted a renewed push within the party for it to finally quit its addiction to television advertising in favor of digital. But not everyone is on board, raising the specter of bitter internal fights over strategic vision in the critical months before the midterm elections and into the 2020 presidential contest. There are a lot of people in the progressive community who have turned against TV advertising because they view it as the primary driver for big-moneyed politics, said Jeff Weaver, Bernie Sanders 2016 presidential campaign manager. I think thats a mistake. You are conceding a huge amount of turf to the Republican Party. For years, the Democratic Party has grappled with the changing media landscape and how best to allocate its resources in response to it. But what was largely a tense but civil debate has become something more acrimonious after Hillary Clintons loss in 2016 exposed what many saw as a painfully large digital advantage for Republicans.  THE JUDGES RULING: TRUMP AND THE RULE OF LAW This week, Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst JudgeAndrew Napolitano discusses the true definition of treason: Trump first accused the Times and its unnamed writer of treason, and then he publicly asked for a Department of Justice investigation to find the writer. Then, to change the subject, he threatened to declassify documents submitted to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court in 2016I am deeply disappointed that the president uttered the word treason. This is wrong under the law and a dangerous charge to make. The Times op-ed is protected political speech and personal opinion. Treason is the only crime defined in the Constitution, thereby preventing Congress and the courts from changing its meaning. It consists only of either waging war against the United States or any of the states or providing aid and comfort to those who are waging such a war. The president should know that it is nearly impossible to commit treason by expressing an opinion. Even calling for a Nazi victory over the U.S. during World War II -- as hateful and harmful as such speech was -- constituted protected speech and was hardly treasonous. More here.

WE HAVE SO MANY QUESTIONS  UPI: Ohio organizers are hoping to gather at least 500 people to break a Guinness World Record for most people doing paddle ball at the same time. The record attempt, organized by LAND studio and the Gordon Square Arts District, a public art organization in Cleveland, and hosted by the Superelectric Pinball parlor, is scheduled for Saturday from 10 a.m. until 1 p.m. and will involve a period of paddle ball practice before the official record attempt. LAND studio said it is hoping to gather at least 500 people for the attempt, and each participant will be presented with their own paddle ball to keep after the event. The attempt is timed to coincide with the installation of a 14-foot paddle ball public art sculpture to be installed in the Gordon Square Arts District by Superelectric artists.

I thought he might inadvertently kill me, his accuser Christine Blasey Ford told the Washington Post. He was trying to attack me and remove my clothing. The description of the alleged assault in the Post is horrifying: Kavanaugh and a friendboth stumbling drunk, Ford allegescorralled her into a bedroom during a gathering of teenagers at a house in Montgomery County. While his friend watched, she said, Kavanaugh pinned her to a bed on her back and groped her over her clothes, grinding his body against hers and clumsily attempting to pull off her one-piece bathing suit and the clothing she wore over it. When she tried to scream, she said, he put his hand over her mouth. She says she was able to escape when one of Kavanaugh's friends, who also attended Georgetown Preparatory School, ""jumped on top of them, sending all three tumbling."" ""This is a completely false allegation,"" Kavanaugh wrote in a statement. ""I am willing...to refute this false allegation from 36 years ago, and defend my integrity."" Already, parallels have been drawn between this scandal and Anita Hill's testimony about getting sexually harassed by Clarence Thomas, who was still able to take a seat on the Supreme Court. But even now, in the era of #MeToo, conservatives are doing backflips to justify their continued support of Kavanaugh. As Donald Trump said about #MeToo, according to Bob Woodward's new book, Youve got to deny, deny, deny and push back on these women. If you admit to anything and any culpability, then youre dead. Here's how the right has tried to discredit or downplay Ford's accusation: On Tuesday, Kavanaugh ally Carrie Severino characterized Ford's sexual assault allegation as ""rough horseplay,"" which I guess is the 2018 version of ""locker room talk."" ""Her allegations cover a whole range of conduct from boorishness to rough horseplay to actual attempted rape,"" Severino said in response to a question about whether Ford's claims should disqualify Kavanaugh from serving on the high court. ""I don't think anywhere in there she's saying this is boorish horseplay at all,"" CNN host Kate Bolduan responded. ""She's certainly implying that it's attempted rape, but I think...there's 35 years of memory that we're trying to play with here and I'm saying the behavior that described could describe a whole range of things,"" Severino said. Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein received a letter detailing Ford's accusations in late July, but CNN reported she didn't make the information public because Ford ""had asked to remain confidential."" In an interview with the New York Times, Republican Senator Susan Collins, who is still undecided on Kavanaugh pending a hearing on Ford's accusation, said it was unfair that Feinstein and the Democrats didn't make Ford's allegation against Kavanaugh public weeks ago.  What is puzzling to me is the Democrats, by not bringing this out earlier, after having had this information for more than six weeks, have managed to cast a cloud of doubt on both the professor and the judge, Collins said. If they believed Professor Ford, why didnt they surface this information earlier so that he could be questioned about it? And if they didnt believe her and chose to withhold the information, why did they decide at the 11th hour to release it? It is really not fair to either of them the way it is was handled. Donald Trump Jr. made a similar argument, posting a meme mocking Ford's allegations on his Instagram account, with the caption ""Finestein [sic] had the letter in July and saved it for the eve of his vote... honorable as always. I believe this is a copy for full transparency.  #politics #maga.""  In the Wall Street Journal, Lance Morrow, a fellow at a conservative think tank, wrote a melodramatic op-ed comparing Kavanaugh's sexual assault allegation to the Salem Witch Trials. He explained that 326 years ago, women were falsely accused of being witches and put to death based off ""either malicious or hysterical"" testimony, which is somehow exactly the same as a woman claiming Kavanaugh tried to rape her in high school. ""There had been no police report, and there were no witnesses,"" Morrow wrote. ""The thing happenedif it happenedan awfully long time ago, back in Ronald Reagans time, when the actors in the drama were minors and (the boys, anyway) under the blurring influence of alcohol and adolescent hormones. No clothes were removed, and no sexual penetration occurred."" (That single quote has pretty much everything in it: She's lying, plus it wouldn't be a big deal if it did.) Fox News alum Megyn Kelly, who accused Roger Ailes of sexual harassment, spoke about Ford's accusations on the Today Show. In an apparent effort to discredit Ford, she said, Her lawyer is a well-known Democratic activist. Her lawyer, by the way, was very defensive of Bill Clinton when he got accused by Paul Jones, and said that one allegation of Bill Clinton taking out his private parts in front of Paul Jones wasnt enough for sexual harassment. She then opined, Maybe he blew her off. This is what defenders would say, right? She been harboringshe had an axe to grind about him and she lays the foundation as a Democrat donor, saying I dont wantIm just going with the most dramatic theory. Conservative Washington Post columnist Megan McArdle took to Twitter to defend Kavanaugh, writing: Before Ford gave an on-the-record interview about her accusation, 65 of Kavanaugh's high school acquaintances signed an open letter vouching for his character. ""I know him very well and Im 100 percent behind him,"" Suzanne Matan, one of the signees, told Politico. ""The Brett Kavanaugh I know is a good and decent person, and I have never seen him treat women with anything but respect,"" conservative pundit Virginia Hume wrote on Twitter. In a statement given to Politico, former president George W. Bush, who you may remember for waging a war in Iraq based on falsehoods, echoed a similar sentiment, asserting: Laura and I have known and respected Brett Kavanaugh for decades, and we stand by our comments the night Judge Kavanaugh was nominated.

All rights reserved. All market data delayed 20 minutes. The 'Outnumbered' panel debates the politics of the Michael Cohen investigation. The liberal news media have a new favorite word to use when discussing President Trump: impeachment. For example, MSNBC and CNN reporters, anchors and guests said impeach, impeachment or some other form of the word on the cable news channels an incredible 222 times between 6 a.m. and 11:59 p.m. Wednesday. And of course, they talked about possible impeachment other days as well, and newspapers and websites were also filled with impeachment speculation. Most Democrats in Congress and their leaders are shying away from talking about impeachment before the November midterm elections  but thats not stopping the anti-Trump media. In the discussions about kicking the duly elected president of the United States out of office, speakers gave their fond recollections of the effort to impeach President Nixon, which resulted in his resignation on Aug. 9, 1974. Journalists and the people they interviewed fondly recalled the Nixon drama, talked about the how you cant spell election without an I, and warned the Supreme Court nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh will face fierce opposition from Democrats. Journalists were so desperate for the narrative that they completely ignored correcting a false statement they had promoted for nearly a half-hour across the three broadcast networks. ABC, CBS and NBC first reported that Trump knew in advance of 2016 Trump Tower meeting with Russians. Then when former Trump attorney Michael Cohens lawyer, Lanny Davis, corrected the record the media ignored it for an entire day. Facts apparently dont matter. MSNBC did a number on accuracy and ran an incorrect graphic of how impeachment works two days in a row. Perhaps it was just wishful thinking as the left-wing network hoped that 60 senators could convict the president instead of the required 67. Slate flashed back to the impeachment drama it enjoyed (hint: not the one involving President Clinton.) Most of the articles of impeachment against Nixon could easily apply to Trump, it reported. Journalists couldnt control themselves. NBCs Today co-host Savannah Guthrie was enthralled talking to Meet The Press host Chuck Todd about possible impeachment. So is this gonna, in some way, be like the only issue in the midterms going forward? Guthrie asked. I think its possible, Todd said. Oddly, CNNs Ana Cabrera and sometime-conservative host S.E. Cupp accused the White House of the politics of fear over that same possibility of impeachment. Cupp stressed that saying what her network is saying is stoking these fears that the Democrats will impeach. She claimed its a voter turnout strategy. Apparently, she never watches her own network. But who can blame her? Theres one fly in the ointment. Democrats are afraid that rational Americans dont want to impeach a president for something he might have done that they dont care about and happened before he ever took office. The party fears such impeachment talk might help the GOP. The issue Democrats want to flee is the top agenda item of liberal billionaire Tom Steyer. And at least part of his wish came true  the part hes paying $120 million to get  turning the election into a referendum on impeaching the president. Steyer, whose record of picking winning candidates in elections is atrocious, wants to impeach President Trump and replace him. Possibly with himself. Hes already built a list of 5.5 million impeachment fans and the former hedge fund executive is seriously looking into running for president, according to CNBC. So the news media arent just buying into a bogus exercise in impeachment, they are genuinely doing the work of a likely Democratic candidate. Ah, journalism.

The unidentified team member was caught looking into the camera and then swiftly making the hand gesture, prompting a backlash on social media. The hand signal was seen in the background of MSNBCs live interview with Sector Charleston Commanding Officer Capt. John Reed, who was providing an update on actions taken by the Coast Guard in response to Hurricane Florence. Well, that was about as subtle as a train wreck, on a boat.  pic.twitter.com/nHjTKALgcL Many social media users called for the firing of the individual, accusing him of making a so-called white power hate symbol. The agency immediately responded to the outcry and distanced from the controversy.  We are aware of the offensive video on twitter - the Coast Guard has identified the member and removed him from the response. His actions do not reflect those of the United States Coast Guard. We are aware of the offensive video on twitter - the Coast Guard has identified the member and removed him from the response. His actions do not reflect those of the United States Coast Guard, the agency tweeted. The Guard is now investigating the matter. In a statement, the agency said the incident was a frustrating distraction amid the dangerous hurricane that is poised to affect more than 10 million people this week in the Southeast. There have been at least four deaths since the storm reached the coastline on Friday morning, according to officials. ""This is a frustrating distraction for the Coast Guard during our hurricane response. This person has been removed from the response pending an investigation. These types of actions are not reflective of the core values of the Coast Guard."" Theres no clear consensus whether the OK hand gesture constitutes a hate symbol. While it has been adopted by some fringe far-right figures, it has also been commonly used by many Trump supporters. The Anti-Defamation League previously noted that the OK gesture isnt a hate symbol. Has the simple thumb-and-forefinger OK hand gesture become a white supremacist hand sign? Well, no, it hasnt, but you are likely to hear just the opposite from social media, thanks to the latest hoax from members of notorious website 4chan, read a post from the anti-racism group. SOCIAL MEDIA USERS FALSELY ACCUSE EX-TRUMP OFFICIAL OF MAKING WHITE POWER GESTURE AT KAVANAUGH HEARING Earlier this month, liberal activists accused a Jewish-Mexican former Trump administration official, Zina Gelman Bash, of making the white power hand gesture during the confirmation hearing of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, prompting derogatory descriptions of her as a neo-Nazi or white supremacist. U.S. Attorney John Bash, her husband, defended Bash: The attacks today on my wife are repulsive. Everyone tweeting this vicious conspiracy theory should be ashamed of themselves. We werent even familiar with the hateful symbol being attributed to her for the random way she rested her hand during a long hearing, the tweeted, noting that Bashs grandparents are Holocaust survivors.

While Sen. Dean Heller, R-Nev., has faced tight races in the past, hes never lost an election. But Democrats see an opportunity to make this the first for him  and gain headway in taking control of the Senate. Trump lost Nevada in the 2016 election to Democrat Hillary Clinton, 46 percent to 48 percent, respectively. Fox News has ranked the Senate race a tossup. Read on for a look at the candidates. GOP Sen. Dean Heller is facing a tough re-election campaign. 
								
									(Steve Marcus/Las Vegas Sun via AP)
 A longtime Nevada politician, incumbent Sen. Dean Heller has served in his current role since 2011, when he was first appointed to the seat. Prior to that, Heller represented the 2nd congressional district in the House and served as Nevadas secretary of state. At one point, Heller dismissed Trump and returned a campaign donation. But now, Heller has  for the most part  aligned himself with the president on certain issues, including tax reform, stronger border security and supporting gun rights. Eighty percent of what this president has done has been very, very good, very positive, Heller said. The other 20 percent  he has a reality show. I get it. Its a reality show. FOX NEWS MIDTERM ELECTIONS Trump has backed Heller in the race. His goal for this election, he told the Washington Examiner, is to keep the focus of the campaign on Nevada, instead of Washington, D.C., some 2,400 miles away. And to be sure, his campaign website says he approaches policy issues with one question in mind: How does it affect Nevada? In his last election, which was in 2012, Heller had a one-point victory over Democrat Shelley Berkley. This time around, Heller benefits from more name recognition in the state as well as a heftier campaign coffer. Hes outraised Jacky Rosen so far, with $10.6 million in campaign contributions compared to her $9.2 million. Rep. Jacky Rosen is hoping to unseat incumbent Sen. Dean Heller in Nevada.

 Rep. Jacky Rosen is a first-term congresswoman, having only been elected in 2016. But Democrats are banking on her as an option to flip control of the Senate back to them. A former synagogue leader, Rosen is a member of the Problem Solvers Caucus and touts her efforts for bipartisanship in Congress on her campaign website. Im going to try to give people someone to vote for instead of something to vote against, she previously told Politico, adding, I believe Im going to win this race. TRUMP BACKS NEVADA SEN. HELLER, GIVES OPPONENT NICKNAME Rosen has lived in Nevada for almost 40 years and was the first person in her family to graduate from college, according to her campaign website. To do that, she was a waitress and continued to work weekends at banquets when she began her career as a software developer. Rosen has been endorsed by former President Barack Obama and EMILYs List, a pro-choice organization. She supports access to abortion, a pathway to citizenship for those protected under DACA and more stringent gun control, especially in the wake of the Las Vegas concert shooting in 2017 that left 58 people dead. She hasnt shied away from criticizing the president or hitting Heller over support for his policies, including when it comes to immigration, efforts to repeal ObamaCare, the Republican-led tax reform and his backing of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. While Heller has outraised Rosen so far, outside groups have poured $17 million into the race  with about $10 million going to either support Rosen or oppose Heller, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.

But we're little closer to finding out any new information about what actually happened. Ford now says she won't testify before the Senate unless the FBI looks into the incident, but while Donald Trump could order the agency to do so, it doesn't seem likely that he will. Instead, he told reporters, he'd prefer her to appear before the Senate Judiciary on Monday for the scheduled hearing she's already rejected. If she shows up, that would be wonderful, he said Wednesday. If she doesnt show up, that would be unfortunate. The Republican members of the committee largely echoed that line, saying that an FBI investigation was unnecessary. South Carolina Senator Lindsay Graham was particularly blunt about it, saying on Twitter that Ford's request ""is not about finding the truth, but delaying the process till after the midterm elections"" and insisting that ""It is imperative the Judiciary committee move forward on the Kavanaugh nomination and a committee vote be taken ASAP."" Maybe more clearly than Graham intended, this shows what the debate over Kavanaugh is about: not the truth of the accusation or what to do about prominent figures who've done terrible things (in this case, when they were much younger), but the power that conservatives can acquire with another right-wing justice on the Supreme Court. If confirming Kavanaugh means granting a lifetime appointment to a man who might have assaulted a girl years ago, then lied about it, Republicans will take that over the alternative, which is to risk not having a majority on the court. In the month and a half between now and the midterms, there is ample time to attempt to learn more. The Judiciary Committee could negotiate with Ford to get her to answer questions, in writing if not in an open hearing. The committee could also try to learn what it could from other sources, including Mark Judge, the man who Ford says was in the room when Kavanaugh tried to rape herbut Republicans are refusing to subpoena him. And again, the White House could do what the George H.W. Bush administration did in 1991 during the Anita Hill controversy and order an FBI investigation. Instead, the GOP is giving Ford a take-it-or-leave-it offer: a daylong hearing, or we'll just confirm the guy. You don't need to assume that the allegations are true to wish they were explored in more depth. If Kavanaugh didn't actually do what Ford is accusing him of, it'd be to hisand his family'sadvantage to have his name cleared. An investigation, properly conducted, would give the public some more information that could be used to weigh the allegations and cut through some of the partisan shouting that has accompanied the controversy. If we were taking this truly seriously, Graham's calls for a quick confirmation vote would have been excoriated from all sides. Sure, there's a chance that if Kavanuagh's confirmation were delayed past the midterms, Democrats would retake the Senate and block any attempt by Trump to appoint a conservative justice. But is that prospect really worse than that of installing a man who assaulted a woman and then lied about it on the Supreme Court for life? The #MeToo movement has forced people to consider the idea that beloved public figures (usually men) have routinely behaved horribly toward people (usually women) in private. It also calls upon everyone to consider whether we want those who have harassed and assaulted to be in positions of authority and influence, a question that tests our partisan instincts. If a widely admired judge or politician is accused, people on their end of the ideological spectrum will often defend them and minimize the accusations. To admit the accuser may be telling the truth is to open the door to surrendering some measure of power, whether it's a seat on a court or a seat in the Senate. That's to say that when someone from any given side of American politics is accused of something like what Kavanaugh has been accused of, it's a test: Are you open to hearing that a figure you back may have done things that disqualify them from wielding power? Or do you just want more victories for people you agree with politically, at any cost? Republicans as a party failed this test as Trump rose to power, they failed as Roy Moore nearly got elected to the Senate, and it looks like they're failing again now.

Ferrell/Congressional Quarterly/Getty For decades, Brett Kavanaugh has traveled through the ranks of the conservative movement as smoothly as food slides down the gullet of a force-fed foie gras duck. An elite private high school, Yale, Yale Law School, a series of clerkships for conservative judges, a spot on Ken Starr's team during his investigation of Bill Clinton, a gig as a lawyer in George W. Bush's White House, and, thanks to Bush, a federal judgeship. When Donald Trumpor really, the right-wing Federalist Societynominated Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court this summer, a fleet of shiny legal establishment types gushed over the pick, declaring him a fine legal mind and an upstanding citizen. One of Kavanaugh's old professors, a self-described Hillary Clinton supporter named Akhil Reed Amar, called him a ""superb nominee"" in a New York Times op-ed. Those people all look pretty bad right now. The accusation from Christine Blasey Ford that Kavanaugh tried to rape her when they were both teenagers in the early 80s may not derail his ascension to the highest court in the country, pending a Senate hearing that may or may not include her testimony. But in the days since news of that accusation broke, reporting on the milieu from which Kavanaugh emerged has painted an ugly portrait of elite American society as both bacchanalian and banal, a nepotacracy where connections matter far more than any semblance or strain of morality. A contemporary of Kavanaugh's at Georgetown Prep told HuffPost the scene there included ""14-, 15-, 16-year-olds, 17-year-old kids doing whatever the fuck they wanted to do, with no repercussions. Drugs everywhere. Partying everywhere. Drinkingjust whatever we wanted to do. It was unbelievable, off the rails."" At Yale, Kavanaugh belonged to a ""secret society"" that was basically a bunch of guys getting drunk together. To some extent, that's normal college nonsense, but after law school, Kavanaugh clerked for Alex Kozinski a federal judge later pushed out in disgrace after being accused of sexually harassing women he supervised, and showing pornography to his subordinates. (Kavanaugh has said he was unaware of this behavior, though Kozinski's nature doesn't seem to have been much of a secret; the judge ran an email list where he shared dirty jokes and stories.) When Kavanaugh was a judge himself, Amy Chua, the Yale professor most famous for writing Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother, reportedly told her students it was ""no accident"" his female clerks ""looked like models."" (According to the Guardian, a student ""reacted with surprise, and quickly pointed out that Chuas own daughter was due to clerk for Kavanaugh. A source said that Chua quickly responded, saying that her own daughter would not put up with any inappropriate behavior."") None of this necessarily indicts Kavanaugh as an individual. Lots of people drink too much as teenagers and party hard in college; Chua's alleged comments may have reflected an inaccurate perception of his hiring practices. Still, it gives us an impression of what the world of political and legal elites is like: Bad behavior is quickly forgotten or forgiven, young women are pressured to look attractive, and powerful men can harass their subordinates for years without consequences.  The professional side of Kavanaugh's world doesn't look much more virtuous. By all indications, he was a right-wing hack who worked with Starr's team and other conservatives to take down Clinton's presidency in the 90s, then he was a right-wing hack who worked on the 2000 presidential recount in Florida, then he was a right-wing hack in the Bush administration. Democratic Senator Dick Durbin called him ""the Zelig or Forrest Gump of Republican politics"" during Kavanaugh's extremely contentious confirmation hearings for a federal judgeship in 2004. He was eventually confirmed in 2006, after Republicans and Democrats made a broader deal about judicial appointments. Since then, ""Hes been what I thought he would be, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham told the Washington Post in July. I bet you that hes been what they thought he would be. Predictably, as a judge Kavanaugh has been reliably anti-abortion, anti-regulation, anti-union, and pro-gunin other words, he has been working the same right-wing causes, only now wearing robes instead of a suit. He's spent his entire career promoting and working for the conservative movement, and he has been rewarded for his continued loyalty with a position of extreme power.  But if Kavanaugh is just an ideological tool, why were so many centrist and liberal figures in the legal world voicing their support when he was nominated? I put that question to Jeff Hauser, a lawyer and the executive director of the Revolving Door Project, a left-leaning anti-corruption organization, who strongly opposes Kavanaugh's nomination. He chalked up some of Kavanaugh's support to an awful tendency in elite circles to put congeniality and collegiality over ethics, but also noted that some lawyers might have pragmatic reasons to back Kavanaugh. He pointed to Lisa Blatt, who publicly backed Kavanaugh despite being a ""liberal feminist lawyer"" and who works at an elite law firm that naturally wants the Supreme Court to take up as many of its cases as possible. Hauser emphasized that he wasn't saying there was any sort of quid pro quo arrangement between any judge and any lawyer, but told me, If I were an in-house lawyer at a corporation and I was deciding between the dozen important appellate litigation shops in DC,"" he might take Blatt's link to Kavanaugh into account. (I reached out to Blatt for comment and will update the story if and when she responds.) The small-world chuminess of the US legal establishment has been on display in the wake of Ford's accusation, too. On Thursday, Ed Whelan, a prominent member of the conservative legal movement, spewed out a conspiratorial Twitter thread in which he alleged that Ford may have confused Kavanaugh for a lookalike classmate, then named that classmate, stopping just short of accusing that man of sexual assault. Ford denied that she would have ever mixed the two up, Whelan later apologized profusely, and said he didn't communicate with Kavanaugh or the White House about his thread. (He did reportedly get the help of a Virginia PR firm.) But the Washington Post reported Friday that ""Kavanaugh and his allies have been privately discussing a defense that would not question whether an incident involving Ford happened, but instead would raise doubts that the attacker was Kavanaugh."" And conservative New York Times columnist Ross Douthat bizarrely lent some of his credibility to Whelan's ravings: Clearly, the fact that these people know each other doesn't make any of them right about anything. The back-scratching op-eds written in Kavanaugh's favor by his friends didn't prove anything other than his friends' connections at prominent publications. And the defenses of Kavanaugh, whether wild-eyed like Whelan's or more measured, just show us how ready conservatives are to close ranks. Theres a greater sense of solidarity and kinship between elite law school conservatives than elite law school centrists and liberals, Hauser told me. An attack on Kavanaugh really is an attack on all of them. Kavanaugh may still be confirmed in the coming days, as many Republican senators care more about creating a conservative majority on the Supreme Court than the accusations against him. At this point, the GOP is well practiced in ignoring or discounting allegations of sexual assault. But let's not forget that the path Kavanaugh has walked to power is designed for people like himprivileged, white, connected, conservative. The system exists to promote his type and to excuse any blemish, past or present. We used to ask how the US got Donald Trump, but the answer seems obvious: We got him the same way we got all these other guys.

As Kavanaugh sat silently with his family behind him, Democratic senators protested a lack of time to review the nominees voluminous records from his time in the George W. Bush Administration, the withholding of certain documents under executive privilege and the speed with which the committee was moving on confirmation. We are rushing through this process in a way that is unnecessary, said Democratic Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey. He and other senators spoke out of turn, as protesters with the liberal group Code Pink periodically jumped up and began shouting, leading to a chaotic opening to a week of hearings. We stand for reproductive rights, yelled one protester. Please vote no! yelled another. An illegitimate president cannot make a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court, yelled a third. Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley hadnt even finished his opening statement as order in the hearing broke down. Right before Grassley was slated to deliver it, the majority of Democrats on the committee, with the exception of ranking member Dianne Feinstein, moved to adjourn the hearing, arguing that the documents from Kavanaughs time in the Bush White House that the Senate had received Monday night was a cause for delay. Feinstein expressed her displeasure with the hearings in her opening statement but stayed out of the procedural fray. As the Democrats on the committee were making their requests, members of the public watching the hearing in the back of the room were voicing their own opposition and being led away. At least 15 protests interrupted the hearing during the first 45 minutes. One code pink protester held up a sign, that read ROE- YES KAVANA-NOPE, a reference to the 1973 landmark Supreme Court decision Roe v. Wade that upheld a womans constitutional right to an abortion. The entire time this was happening, Kavanaugh sat silently in the middle of the room, watching both senators and spectators denounce his nomination. As Grassley repeatedly tried to read his opening statement, Democrats again brought up their desire to adjourn the hearing. Grassley let them speak, but warned their efforts would ultimately be futile. Were going to not necessarily accommodate all obstruction, but if people have got something to say, this chairman is going to let them say it, Grassley said. But its pretty boring to hear the same thing all the time.

On Thursday, Kavanaugh was asked by Sen. Ted Cruz about his dissent in the Priests for Life v. the U.S. Department of Human and Health Services case. In 2015, while serving on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, Kavanaugh sided with a religious organization that objected to providing contraception for employees with insurance. Priests for Life contested the Affordable Care Act (ACA) requirement that all health plans cover birth control, claiming that IUDs and emergency contraception causes abortion instead of acting as birth control. Under the ACA, employers who wished for the government to fund the contraceptives had to fill out a form to their insurers to avoid a monetary fine. In the suit, Priests for Life said filling out the form made them complicit in providing contraception and violated the organizations religious freedom. The D.C. Circuit Court ruled in favor of the Obama administration while Kavanaugh dissented from the majority. During todays hearing, Kavanaugh explained his dissent to Cruz. The question was first, was this a substantial burden on their religious exercise? And it seemed to me, quite clearly, it was, he said. They said filling out the form would make them complicit in the abortion-inducing drugs that they were, as a religious matter, objected to. The phrase abortion-inducing drugs, in reference to contraception, was how Priests for Life described the contraception in the suit. Kavanaughs wording has many pro-choice organizations up in arms and is said to be proof of his pro-life leanings. Many opposing Kavanaughs confirmation have argued if he is approved, he will attempt to overturn Roe vs. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion nationwide. Saying abortion-inducing drugs to describe contraception is straight out of the anti-choice, anti-science phrase book used to restrict womens access to essential health care.

The committee has received more documents about Kavanaugh than any previous Supreme Court nominee, but those more than 400,000 documents make up just 10% of his record, and dont include records from his time working as staff secretary in George W. Bushs White House. Senators on both sides of the aisle bristled at each other, with little sign of collegiality or the team mentality that Kavanaugh  or Coach K  promotes when he coaches his daughters basketball team, according to a letter from team parents cited by Republican Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona. Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas said the hearing had devolved into mob rule by the Democrats. Long-serving Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont lamented the way the nomination was playing out. Im just sorry to see the Senate Judiciary Committee descend this way, he said. Overseeing the chaos, Grassley let the Democrats vent for more than an hour, but wouldnt call a vote on a motion to adjourn the hearing. If people have got something to say, this chairman is going to let them say it, he said. But its pretty boring to hear the same thing all the time. Later, as Cornyn complained that Democrats were running over their 10-minute allotment for opening statements, Grassley sighed, I let the committee run me this time. Much of the Democrats frustration may be exacerbated by the fact that they likely wont be able to prevent Kavanaugh from being confirmed. If Republicans stick together, they can push him through with a simple majority without any votes from the other side. Loudly and publicly voicing opposition is the only real recourse Democrats have to try to affect the outcome. Read More: Democrats Want to Stop Brett Kavanaugh. They May Be Out of Options Republicans on the committee charged that Democrats were following a game plan. Illinois Senator Dick Durbin, the No. 2 Democrat in the Senate, confirmed that there was a conference call over the weekend for Democrats to map out their strategy for the hearing. There are always many conference calls (and meetings, etc.) before Supreme Court confirmation hearings, a Democratic aide told TIME in an email. There has been a lot to talk about in the last several days, including over the long holiday weekend. While Kavanaugh said that a judge must be a neutral and impartial arbiter who favors no litigant or policy and that he does not decide cases based on personal or policy preferences, the controversial president who nominated him hung heavy over many of the Democrats statements and Tuesdays proceedings demonstrated what a uniquely political fight Kavanaughs nomination has become. It is ultimately an effort to re-litigate the last presidential election, said Republican Sen. Mike Crapo of Idaho. Tensions in the hearing room, already high among the senators on the dais, were amplified by near-constant interruptions by protesters from the seats reserved for spectators in the back. As the committee bickered up front, dozens of protesters were removed throughout the day for standing up and yelling during the proceedings. Kavanaugh is a danger to the future of America! one protester cried. My daughter deserves the right to choose! Moving forward with this nomination is against everything we stand for as a nation! yelled another protester wearing a shirt that said spiritual gangster on it. Multiple disruptions came from people who said they had preexisting conditions and were worried about their healthcare coverage. A group of women wearing red handmaids robes from the television show The Handmaids Tale kept a silent vigil outside the hearing room as people entered in the morning; as other demonstrators were escorted out throughout the day, those in the hearing room could still hear them chanting Hell nah, Kavanaugh! outside. In fact, irritation with disruptive protesters became one of the only issues that sparked agreement between political parties during the day. Democrat Leahy said he wouldnt keep reading his opening statement during the interruptions. I dont care whose side theyre on, he said. Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah complained about the insolence of the protesters and said, These people are so out of line they shouldnt even be allowed into the doggone room. Throughout the chaos emanating from both the front and back of the room, Kavanaugh sat quietly at his desk facing the senators, in the eye of the storm. The Supreme Court must never, never be viewed as a partisan institution, Kavanaugh said during his opening statement, which didnt begin until just before 5 pm. The Justices on the Supreme Court do not sit on opposite sides of an aisle. It was a rosy sentiment, and one that was undermined by the nearly seven hours of highly political fighting that had preceded it.",Anger and Partisanship Dominated Day One of Brett Kavanaugh’s Hearings,http://time.com/5386443/brett-kavanaugh-supreme-court-hearing-partisan-protest/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/cm_kavanaugh_dc_09_04_18_0840.jpg?quality=85,left

On Wednesday, Kavanaugh can expect to spend most of the day in the hot seat, sparring with Democratic senators over abortion, guns, executive power and other high-profile issues. A long day of questioning awaits the 53-year-old appellate judge, whom Trump nominated in July to fill the seat of retired Justice Anthony Kennedy. The change could make the court more conservative on a range of issues. Barring a surprise, Republicans appear on track to confirm Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, perhaps in time for the first day of the new term, Oct. 1, little more than a month before congressional elections. However, the first of at least four days of hearings by the Senate Judiciary Committee began with partisan quarreling over the nomination and persistent protests from members of the audience, followed by their arrests. Strong Democratic opposition to Trumps nominee reflects the political stakes for both parties in advance of the November elections, Robert Muellers investigation of Trumps 2016 campaign and the potentially pivotal role Kavanaugh could play in moving the court to the right. Democrats, including several senators poised for 2020 presidential bids, tried to block the proceedings in a dispute over Kavanaugh records withheld by the White House. Republicans in turn accused the Democrats of turning the hearing into a circus. Trump jumped into the fray late in the day, saying on Twitter that Democrats were looking to inflict pain and embarrassment on Kavanaugh. The presidents comment followed the statements of Democratic senators who warned that Trump was, in the words of Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, selecting a justice on the Supreme Court who potentially will cast a decisive vote in his own case. In Kavanaughs own statement at the end of more than seven hours of arguing, the federal appeals judge spoke repeatedly about the importance of an independent judiciary and the need to keep the court above partisan politics, common refrains among Supreme Court nominees that had added salience in the fraught political atmosphere of the moment. With his wife, two children and parents sitting behind him, Kavanaugh called himself a judge with a straightforward judicial philosophy. A judge must be independent and must interpret the law, not make the law. A judge must interpret statutes as written. A judge must interpret the Constitution as written, informed by history and tradition and precedent, he said. The most likely outcome of this weeks hearings is a vote along party lines to send Kavanaughs nomination to the full Senate. Majority Republicans can confirm Kavanaugh without any Democratic votes, though theyll have little margin for error. There are battles worth fighting, regardless of the outcome, Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, said in an unsparing opening statement that criticized Kavanaughs judicial opinions and the Senate process that Democrats said had deprived them of access to records of important chunks of Kavanaughs time as an aide to President George W. Bush. Democrats raised objections from the moment Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, gaveled the committee to order. One by one, Democrats, including Kamala Harris of California, Cory Booker of New Jersey and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, all potential presidential contenders, demanded that Republicans delay the hearing. They railed against the unusual vetting process by Republicans that failed to include documents from three years Kavanaugh worked in the Bush administration, and 100,000 more pages withheld by the Trump White House. Some 42,000 pages were released to senators only, not the public, on the evening before the hearing. As protesters repeatedly interrupted the session, Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, who is fighting for his own re-election in Texas, apologized to Kavanaugh for the spectacle he said had less to do about the judges legal record than Trump in the White House. It is about politics, said Cruz. It is about Democratic senators re-litigating the 2016 election. Republicans will hold a slim 51-49 majority in the Senate once Jon Kyl, the former Arizona senator, is sworn in to fill the seat held by the late Sen. John McCain. Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska are the only two Republicans even remotely open to voting against Kavanaugh, though neither has said she would do so.

But perhaps DeVoss most alarming error to date has received insufficient public attention. This disregard is regrettable because her blunder illuminates one of the U.S. Supreme Courts most momentous opinions  and exposes a mounting threat to the decision. As last school year drew to a close, Congressman Adrian Espaillat of New York asked DeVos in a committee hearing whether public educators could report undocumented students to Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Sir, I think thats a school decision, DeVos replied. Thats a community decision. That response, however, revealed a deluded conception of unauthorized immigrants constitutional rights. In 1982, the Supreme Court, in a 5-4 decision called Plyler v. Doe, rejected a Texas law that authorized local schools to exclude undocumented students. Writing for the Court, Justice William Brennan found that the law impermissibly punished innocent children for parental misconduct, and that it clashed with the countrys deepest constitutional commitments. If left unchecked, Brennan reasoned, the measure raise[d] the specter of a permanent caste of undocumented resident aliens, a development present[ing] most difficult problems for a Nation that prides itself on adherence to principles of equality under law. In essence, a students immigration status forms an illegitimate basis for barring children from school. When the Court issued Plyler, no state in the country other than Texas had enacted such legislation. This legislative backdrop has motivated prominent constitutional scholars to dismiss Plyler as an insignificant opinion that invalidated merely an outlier statute. The Courts decision is thus construed as merely eliminating a blatantly outlandish measure  one that would hold no appeal beyond the Lone Star State, where a cowboy mentality prevails. But such dismissive assessments miss the mark. Rather than some trivial event in the nations constitutional history, it seems far more accurate to understand Plyler as preventing an isolated measure from becoming pervasive, as anxieties about unauthorized immigrants extend well beyond states along the southern border. Few opinions in American history have had more profound consequences than Plylers guarantee that the schoolhouse doors cannot be closed to one of societys most marginalized, vilified groups. The opinion has single-handedly enabled innumerable children to use education to expand both their minds and their horizons. About two weeks after her blunder, DeVos retreated from claiming that public schools could police students immigration status, labeling Plyler a settled case and conceding that undocumented students have the right to an education. The pressing question now, however, is: how much longer will that right exist? Several factors suggest that Plyler could soon be endangered. Trumps successful presidential campaign, which cast unauthorized immigrants as boogeymen, revealed unmistakably that nativist sentiment exerts a powerful force throughout the country. That reality indicates it is only a matter of time before localities, states and perhaps even the federal government enact measures challenging Plyler. (One could imagine supporters echoing the Trump Administrations logic for its family-separation policy: that it would deter parents from bringing their children to the United States illegally.) Although Alabama and California both enacted legislation designed to undermine Plyler several years ago, those efforts were successfully interred in lower federal courts. But this time could be different. Indeed, ample reason suggests the Supreme Court could greet new anti-Plyler legislation favorably. In 1982, a young lawyer working in the Reagan Administration named John G. Roberts, Jr. coauthored a memorandum bemoaning the Department of Justices failure to file an amicus brief in Plyler actively supporting Texas. Had it done so, Roberts speculated, the Court would have upheld the law. Now the Chief Justice, if Roberts continues to believe that Plyler erred, then he could well rally his fellow conservative colleagues to overturn the decision. Robertss burden on this front appears on the verge of growing easier, as Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaughs confirmation hearings commence. If  as seems probable  Kavanaugh secures confirmation, he would fill the seat of his old boss, Justice Anthony Kennedy. Kennedys jurisprudence often exhibited solicitude for the plight of vulnerable children  the reasoning in Plyler. Yet while it was exceedingly difficult to envision Kennedy abandoning undocumented children, it seems eminently plausible that Kavanaugh would do so. The reason is simple: Kavanaugh, unlike Kennedy, has been a steadfast, even exuberant participant in the Republican partys movement for constitutional conservatism, and the G.O.P. has now coalesced around an anti-immigrant ethos. Where Kennedy often bucked Federalist Society orthodoxy, only a naf would doubt Kavanaughs devotion. If Democratic Senators press Kavanaugh on Plyler in hearings, he will likely, borrowing from Secretary DeVos, deem the opinion settled. But that is no guarantee that he will uphold the precedent, a prospect that undocumented families  and, indeed, all families  should find unsettling.

Judge Brett Kavanaugh, 53, has served for the past 12 years on the appeals court in Washington, D.C., which is considered the second most important court in the country after the Supreme Court. He has a solidly conservative record, including a dissenting opinion last year that would have denied immediate access to an abortion for an immigrant teenager in federal custody. 






Kavanaugh worked in key White House positions when George W. Bush was president and was a member of independent counsel Kenneth Starrs legal team that investigated President Bill Clinton in the late 1990s, leading to Clintons impeachment.


As a young lawyer, Kavanaugh worked for Justice Anthony Kennedy, the man he would replace on the high court. Kennedy retired at the end of July. Trumps first nominee, Justice Neil Gorsuch, also was a Kennedy law clerk the same year as Kavanaugh.
The first day of the Senate Judiciary Committee hearings Tuesday will feature opening statements from senators and Kavanaugh himself. His remarks are not likely to be released in advance, but nominees often sing the praises of judicial independence. When he was sworn in as an appellate judge in 2006, Kavanaugh called an independent judiciary the crown jewel of our constitutional democracy.
Questioning will begin on Wednesday, and votes in committee and on the Senate floor could occur later in September. If all goes as Republicans plan, Kavanaugh could be on the bench when the court begins its new term on Oct. 1.

Sen. Chuck Grassley, the Iowa Republican who is the committee chairman, has called Kavanaugh one of the most qualified nominees ever picked for the court. The American Bar Association has given Kavanaugh its highest rating, well qualified.
Rebuffed in their request to delay the hearing, Democrats are planning to shine a light on Kavanaughs views on abortion, executive power and whether Trump could be forced to testify as part of special counsel Robert Muellers Russia investigation.
I remain troubled by your view of executive power, Democratic Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware, a committee member, wrote Friday in an open letter to Kavanaugh. I am not satisfied with your responses to me during our private meeting, and I believe that you owe the Committee and the American people more thorough, candid answers during your hearing next week.


Many Democratic senators already have announced their intention to vote against Kavanaugh and many Republicans have likewise signaled their support. A handful of Democrats seeking re-election in states Trump carried in 2016 could vote for Kavanaugh.
If no Democrat ultimately supports the nomination, the Republicans have no margin for error in a Senate they control by 50-49. Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska are the only two Republicans even remotely open to voting against Kavanaugh, though neither has said she would do so. Abortion rights supporters are trying to appeal to those senators by focusing on concerns that Kavanaugh could vote to limit abortion rights or even overturn the landmark Roe v. Wade ruling from 1973 that first established a womans constitutional right to an abortion.


Democrats have been under intense pressure from liberal voters to resist Trump, and many remain irate, even two years later, over the treatment of Merrick Garland, President Barack Obamas nominee for the Supreme Court, who was denied so much as a hearing last year by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.
But Democrats are powerless to delay a vote on Kavanaugh since McConnell led Republicans, during the Gorsuch nomination, in eliminating the 60-vote filibuster threshold that had been in place for Supreme Court nominations.
The filibuster rule required 60 of the 100 votes to advance a bill or nomination, in contrast to the simple 51-vote majority that applies in most cases.

Christine Blasey Ford says in the interview with The Washington Post that Kavanaugh and a friend  both stumbling drunk, she says  corralled her into a bedroom during the party in the early 1980s. She says Kavanaugh groped her over her clothes, grinded his body against hers and tried to take off her one-piece swimsuit and the outfit she wore over it. Kavanaugh covered her mouth with his hand when she tried to scream, she says. I thought he might inadvertently kill me, says Ford, 51, and a professor at Palo Alto University in California. He was trying to attack me and remove my clothing. She says she was able to get away after Kavanaughs friend jumped on top of them and everyone tumbled. Kavanaugh has denied the allegation. He repeated that denial again Sunday through the White House. I categorically and unequivocally deny this allegation. I did not do this back in high school or at any time, Kavanaugh said. Ford says in the interview that she never revealed what had happened to her until 2012, when she and her husband sought couples therapy. Portions of her therapists notes, which Ford provided to the Post, do not mention Kavanaugh by name but say Ford reported being attacked by students from an elitist boys school who went on to become highly respected and high-ranking members of society in Washington. Kavanaugh, 53, is a federal appeals judge in Washington. President Donald Trump nominated him in July to replace retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy on the U.S. Supreme Court. The therapists notes say four boys were involved, but Ford says that was an error by the therapist. Ford says four boys were at the party, but only two boys were in the room at the time. Ford had contacted the Post through a tip line in early July after it had become clear that Kavanaugh was on Trumps shortlist to fill a vacancy but before the Republican president nominated him. A registered Democrat, Ford contacted her representative in Congress, Democrat Ann Eshoo, around the same time. In late July, Ford sent a letter through Eshoos office to Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee. Feinstein revealed late last week that she had received a letter, but said the author did not want to come forward. Ford told the Post she decided to come forward after watching portions of her story come out without her permission. She said if anyone was going to tell her story, she wanted it to be her.",Brett Kavanaugh Accuser Opens Up About the Alleged Sexual Assault,http://time.com/5397627/brett-kavanaugh-sexual-assault/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/cm_kavanaugh_dc_09_04_18_0715.jpg?quality=85,left

Dianne Feinstein, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said Thursday she has notified federal investigators about information she received  and wont disclose publicly  concerning Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. The California Democrat said in a statement that she received information from an individual concerning the nomination. She said the person strongly requested confidentiality, declined to come forward or press the matter further, and I have honored that decision. The Judiciary Committee, which has finished confirmation hearings for Kavanagh, is scheduled to vote next Thursday on whether to recommend that Kavanaughs nomination be confirmed by the full Senate. Feinsteins statement that she has referred the matter to federal investigative authorities jolted Capitol Hill and threatens to disrupt what has been a steady path toward confirmation for Kavanaugh by Republicans eager to see the conservative judge on the court. An FBI spokeswoman declined to comment. Feinstein declined to answer questions outside the hearing room, and other senators offices largely deferred to the ranking member. Democratic senators on the panel met privately Wednesday evening and discussed the information, according to two Senate aides who were not authorized to discuss the situation publicly but spoke on condition of anonymity. The White House questioned the timing of Feinsteins move, calling it an 11th hour attempt to delay his confirmation. Throughout his confirmation process, Judge Kavanaugh has had 65 meetings with senators  including with Senator Feinstein  sat through over 30 hours of testimony, addressed over 2,000 questions in a public setting and additional questions in a confidential session. Not until the eve of his confirmation has Sen. Feinstein or anyone raised the specter of new information about him, said Kerri Kupec, a White House spokesperson. Kupec added that the FBI has vetted Kavanaugh thoroughly and repeatedly during his career in government and the judiciary. Democrats dont have the votes to block Kavanaughs nomination, if Republicans hold unified, but are fighting it and decrying the process that Republicans used to compile his government records for review. At the committee Thursday, Republicans brushed aside a flurry of Democratic attempts to delay the consideration of Kavanaugh or subpoena more documents about his past work, sticking with a schedule that could see him confirmed by Oct. 1. Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut protested that the nomination will be tainted and stained by the unusual process for vetting the nominee. We lack the time. We lack the documents. He called it a badly broken process. Feinstein had sought a subpoena for documents from Kavanaughs time as Bushs staff secretary. She said senators should be able to see this record and wondered, What in Judge Kavanaughs records are Republicans hiding? The Republicans have declined to pursue Kavanaughs staff secretary documents, saying it would be too cumbersome. They rejected Feinsteins motion and several others, including motions to subpoena documents and witnesses and a motion to adjourn. Chairman Chuck Grassley set the panels vote on Kavanaugh for Sept. 20. New documents released ahead of Thursdays hearing included Kavanaughs 263-page written response to questions from senators, along with dozens of files from the judges work in the George W. Bush White House that had been available to senators only on a committee confidential basis. Democratic Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey made the Bush documents public. Among the details in the new written responses, Kavanaugh says he would have shaken the hand of a school shooting victims father during a break in last weeks Senate hearing had he recognized him before being whisked away by security detail. The 28 new committee confidential documents released by Booker, meanwhile, are from Kavanaughs time in the White House counsels office during the George W. Bush administration and deal with his work on judicial nominations. The documents show Kavanaughs involvement in Bushs nomination of Charles Pickering to an appellate court in the South as Pickering faced questions about his views on race relations. Kavanaugh had indicated in 2006 testimony that he was not substantially involved in the nomination. In releasing a new batch of committee confidential documents about Kavanaugh, Booker, the New Jersey Democrat, was repeating a tactic that could prompt a review from the Senate Ethics Committee. Booker is being criticized by his GOP colleagues and outside groups for releasing the documents. Last week, he released some documents that were later made public by the committee, but also others that werent. Wednesdays disclosure brings the total to 75. The conservative group Judicial Watch delivered a letter Wednesday to the Senate Ethics Committee seeking an investigation. It says Booker violated Senate rules against disclosing confidential documents and could face Senate expulsion. Booker has welcomed the fight. He says the documents about Kavanaughs work raise more serious and concerning questions about his honesty during his testimony before the committee. At issue has been the unprecedented process the Senate Judiciary Committee used for gathering documents on Kavanaugh, an appellate court judge who is President Donald Trumps nominee to replace retired Justice Anthony Kennedy on the court. __ Associated Press writer Eric Tucker in Washington contributed to this report.",Senator Dianne Feinstein Gave the FBI Information About Brett Kavanaugh,http://time.com/5395687/senator-feinstein-fbi-kavanaugh/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/feinstein-kavanaugh-fbi.jpg?quality=85,left

But Democrats and Republicans alike believe the verdict is already in. Barring a bad performance, Kavanaughs confirmation to be the next Supreme Court justice appears all but assured. Thats because Republicans can push through his nomination with a simple majority, so long as their caucus holds together. And despite Democrats best efforts, theres little evidence theyve been able to persuade any GOP senators to vote against him. Theres no procedural silver bullet to any of this, says a Senate Democratic aide. The only way to defeat Brett Kavanaugh is to flip votes. Not that they havent tried. Democrats have spent the summer fighting mightily to derail Kavanaughs nomination. Outside groups have funneled time and money into probing his record from the White House and his writings as a judge. Activists have held protests. And Senate Democrats have assailed Kavanaughs record on issues like abortion, healthcare and executive power. Democrats have painted Kavanaugh, who worked as a lawyer in George W. Bushs White House and as a member of Kenneth Starrs independent counsel investigation of President Bill Clinton, as a partisan who would roll back Roe v. Wade and shape the court through his expansive views of executive power. I dont have any doubt where he comes down on these issues, Illinois Senator Dick Durbin, a member of the Judiciary Committee and the number two Democrat in the Senate, tells TIME. With all due respect, Judge Kavanaugh speaks fluent Republican. Read More: Inside Trumps Plan to Dramatically Reshape U.S. Courts The Democratic minority has focused much of its efforts on senators Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, two moderate Republicans who support abortion rights. Neither woman has announced which way she plans to vote on Kavanaugh. But Collins said she had an excellent session with him when they met in August and that he told her he believes Roe v. Wade is settled law. Murkowski said she hasnt seen anything in Kavanaughs record she would consider disqualifying, CNN reports. Both Collins and Murkowski voted for Trumps first Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch last year. With limited power and long odds, Democrats are gearing up to grill Kavanaugh this week, hoping hell stumble. I think the Democrats realize the only way theyre going to be able to stop him is if there were some sort of explosive thing to come out during the hearings, says Carrie Severino, chief counsel and policy director of the conservative group Judicial Crisis Network. As Democrats attacked Kavanaugh, conservative groups launched a forceful campaign to shape voter perceptions of the judge, who has sat on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals since 2006. Judicial Crisis Network has spent $4.3 million to support Kavanaughs nomination, running ads on Fox, MSNBC and CNN. Thats more than Democratic counterparts, like the progressive judicial advocacy group Alliance for Justice, have been able to spend. Theyre willing to put up millions of dollars in order to get their judges confirmed, marvels Nan Aron, president of Alliance for Justice. Putting judges and justices on the bench is one thing [President Trump] can offer to the right-wing base of his party. Theres some evidence that the Lefts campaign against Kavanaugh is working. A CNN poll from August found that just 37% of Americans want the Senate to confirm him, the lowest public support for a Supreme Court nominee since Robert Borks nomination by President Ronald Reagan in 1987. Republicans say the opposition has been unfair. I honestly think that they hate Trump so much that if Donald Trump nominated Barack Obama to sit on the Supreme Court, theyd struggle to be a Yes with that as well, says Antonia Ferrier, Staff Director for the Senate Republican Communications Center. But more importantly, Kavanaugh has maintained support among Republicans: 74% of them would still like to see Kavanaugh confirmed, according to the same poll. Read More: The Era of the Swing Justice Is Over. Heres How Democrats May Adapt As Democrats hammer Kavanaugh on his record, theyre also fighting the process. Kavanaugh has a longer paper trail than most other Supreme Court nominees in history, working for years in Bushs White House counsels office and then as staff secretary, a key position that oversees the flow of all documents to the President. The vast trove of papers from Kavanaughs three years as staff secretary wont be made public before the hearings. While Democrats complain that the Senate Judiciary Committee has received just 6% of documents from Kavanaughs time in the White House, Republicans note that the more than 200,000 pages from Kavanaughs government work mark a new record for Supreme Court confirmations. 200k pages of Kavanaughs govt work r now public Thats new record for public docs in SCOTUS confirmation HISTORY My staff will finish reviewing all docs received well ahead of public hearing Sept4 /Thats TRANSPARENCY  ChuckGrassley (@ChuckGrassley) August 24, 2018  Democrats have called for the release of more documents and asked to delay the hearings until theyre available. There is this determination now that hell or high water were going to go forward with this Kavanaugh nomination and do it as fast as possible, says Durbin. He and the nine other Democratic members of the Judiciary Committee all signed a letter registering their opposition to the process. But Republican leadership wont budge. Unfortunately, some have tried to criticize what is the most transparent confirmation process in history, Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley said on Aug. 16. But theyre failing. And theyre failing because Democratic leaders have made their true goal obvious: stall the confirmation as long as possible in the hope that Democrats take over the Senate in the midterm elections. Democrats bear some of the blame for their own powerlessness. Democratic Senate Leader Harry Reid began to erode the rules surrounding judicial nominations when he eliminated the filibuster on all presidential nomineesexcept those to the Supreme Court in 2013. In March 2016, Republicans took it to another level when they refused to hold hearings to confirm Judge Merrick Garland, President Obamas nominee to fill Justice Antonin Scalias Supreme Court seat. Senate Republicans said they wouldnt hold a hearing for Garland because it was Obamas last year in office. After they refused to consider Garland, Trump won the presidency and nominated conservative judge Neil Gorsuch to fill the seat instead. Traditionally, Supreme Court confirmations had required some measure of bipartisan consensus to clear a 60-vote threshold, but with Democrats still furious over Garland, in 2017 Republicans invoked the same so-called nuclear option Reid had five years prior, this time for Supreme Court nominees. They confirmed Gorsuch with a simple majority. Majorities in the Senate matter more than they ever did before with regard to the issue of judicial selection and confirmation, says Leonard Leo, who advises Trump on judicial selections. Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell have used the majority to great effect, filling 60 judgeships so far in the Presidents term. Thats more than Bush and Obama combined had appointed at the same point in theirs, according to Pew Research Center.

Kavanaugh released a new statement calling the allegation completely false and saying he had no idea who was making this accusation until she identified herself on Sunday to The Washington Post. I am willing to talk to the Senate Judiciary Committee in any way the Committee deems appropriate to refute this false allegation, from 36 years ago, and defend my integrity, Kavanaugh said. Kavanaugh, meanwhile, was seen arriving at the White House late Monday morning. There was no immediate explanation of the reason for his visit. He had been on a smooth confirmation track, but the new allegations have roiled that process. Republican senators have expressed concern over a womans private-turned-public allegation that a drunken Kavanaugh groped her and tried to take off her clothes at a party when they were teenagers. Debra S. Katz, the attorney for the woman, Christine Blasey Ford, said her client considered the incident to be an attempted rape. She believes that if were not for the severe intoxication of Brett Kavanaugh, she would have been raped, Katz told NBCs Today. Kavanaugh, 53, categorically and unequivocally denied the allegations when they came out anonymously last week. This has not changed, said White House spokesman Kerri Kupec on Monday. Judge Kavanaugh and the White House both stand by that statement. Still, White House counselor Kellyanne Conway said of Ford: She should not be insulted. She should not be ignored. She should testify under oath and she should do it on Capitol Hill. Conway, who said she had discussed the situation with President Donald Trump, said that both Ford and Kavanaugh should testify, but made clear it was up to the Judiciary Committee. She said Sen. Lindsey Graham had told her it could happen as soon as Tuesday and the White House will respect the process. Stressing that Kavanaugh had already testified and undergone FBI background checks, Conway said: I think you have to weigh this testimonial evidence from Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh along with the considerable body of evidence that is already there about the judges temperament and qualifications and character. In morning television interviews, Katz said her client was willing to tell her story in public to the Judiciary panel, although no lawmakers or their aides had yet contacted her. Katz also denied that Ford, a Democrat, is politically motivated. No one in their right mind regardless of their motives would want to inject themselves into this process and face the kind of violation that she will be subjected to by those who want this nominee to go though.  She was quite reluctant to come forward. Initially the sexual misconduct allegation was conveyed in a private letter, without revealing Fords name. With a name and disturbing details, the accusation raised the prospect of congressional Republicans defending Trumps nominee ahead of midterm elections featuring an unprecedented number of female candidates and informed in part by the #MeToo movement. Ford told the Post that Kavanaugh pinned her to a bed at a Maryland party in the early 1980s, clumsily tried to remove her clothing and put his hand over her mouth when she tried to scream. She said Kavanaugh and a friend  both stumbling drunk, she says  corralled her in a bedroom when she was around 15 and Kavanaugh was around 17. She says Kavanaugh groped her over her clothes, grinded his body against hers and tried to take off her one-piece swimsuit and the outfit she wore over it. Kavanaugh covered her mouth with his hand when she tried to scream, she says, and escaped when the friend, Mark Judge, jumped on them. Kavanaugh attended a private school for boys in Maryland while Ford attended a nearby school. A split seemed to be emerging among the GOP. The GOP-controlled Judiciary Committee has previously scheduled a Thursday vote on whether to recommend approval of Kavanaughs nomination in the full Senate. Democrats, led by Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York, called for a delay in the vote, and two committee Republicans  all 11 on the GOP side are men  Sens. Jeff Flake of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, said they wanted to hear more from Ford. Flake went as far as to say he was not comfortable voting for Kavanaugh for the time being. A potential no vote from Flake would complicate the judges prospects. A Republican not on the committee, Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee, said the vote should be postponed until the committee heard from Ford. Contacted Sunday by CNN, Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, wouldnt say if the vote should be postponed. A committee spokesman said late Sunday that its chairman, Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, was trying to arrange separate, follow-up calls with Kavanaugh and Ford, but just for aides to Grassley and Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., before Thursdays scheduled vote. Critics have already accused the GOP of fast-tracking the process to get Kavanaugh on the court by Oct. 1, the first day of the fall term. The allegation against Kavanaugh first came to light late last week in the form of a letter that had been for some time in the possession of Feinstein, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee and one of its four female members. On Sunday, The Washington Post published an interview with Ford. I thought he might inadvertently kill me, said Ford, 51, a clinical psychology professor at Palo Alto University in California. He was trying to attack me and remove my clothing. In the interview, Ford says she never revealed what had happened to her until 2012, when she and her husband sought couples therapy. Fords husband, Russell Ford, said he recalled his wife using Kavanaughs last name and expressing concern that Kavanaugh  then a federal judge  might someday be nominated to the Supreme Court. Senate Republicans, along with the White House, see no need to postpone voting over what they consider uncorroborated and unverifiable accusations, according to a person familiar with the situation but not authorized to speak publicly. In considering their options Sunday, Republicans largely settled on the view that Fords story alone was not enough to delay Kavanaughs confirmation. Grassley could invite Ford to testify, likely in closed session before Thursday. Kavanaugh would also probably be asked to appear before senators. The panel would also likely seek testimony from Judge, Kavanaughs friend and classmate who Ford says jumped on top of her. Judge has denied that the incident happened. Republicans have not settled on the strategy, the person familiar with the situation said, but were weighing options, including doing nothing. Republicans say the allegations have already cast a shadow over Kavanaugh but that it does not appear to be enough to change the votes in the narrowly divided 51-49 Senate. Key will be the views of Collins and Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. Both are under enormous pressure from outside groups who want them to oppose Kavanaugh on grounds that as a justice he could vote to undercut the Roe v. Wade ruling legalizing abortion in the U.S. The White House has accused Feinstein of mounting an 11th hour attempt to delay his confirmation. The White House has also sought to cast doubt about Fords allegation by noting that the FBI has repeatedly investigated Kavanaugh since the 1990s for highly sensitive positions he has held, including in the office of independent counsel Ken Starr, at the White House and his current post on the federal appeals court in Washington. Sixty-five women who knew Kavanagh in high school defended him in a separate letter, circulated by Senate Judiciary Committee Republicans, as someone who always treated women with decency and respect.",Brett Kavanaugh Says He’s Willing to Speak About Woman’s Allegation of Sexual Assault,http://time.com/5398157/brett-kavanaugh-assault-allegation/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/brett-kavanaugh-allegation.jpg?quality=85,left

I had no idea that, in the blink of an eye, I had lost both my legs when a grenade tore through the helicopter I was piloting just north of Baghdad. It took me days to recognize the reality of my disability, months to learn how to walk again and years to get used to the constant, hammering pain thats still there, even when Im just sitting down. Despite it all, I consider myself pretty lucky  not only because of the fantastic medical team that helped me recover and the VA care I still receive today, but also because I am an American with disabilities, which means the Americans with Disabilities Act is in place to safeguard the basic rights I rely on to lead a full life. The rights that activists with disabilities fought so hard for, for so long. That they left their wheelchairs and crawled up the Capitol steps for. The rights that thankfully, finally, got enshrined into law in 1990. That isnt to say there arent still struggles, and we still have a long way to go to achieve true equality. Nearly three decades after the ADA became law, far too many public places continue to be inaccessible and difficult to navigate. On every issue  including transportation, housing, education, health care and employment opportunities  were still working hard toward the goal of ensuring that Americans with disabilities are able to live independently in their communities. But even so, its hard to imagine the exhaustion and frustration that Americans with disabilities mustve felt every day in the years before the ADA became law  when our country openly and unabashedly discriminated against our entire community. And I worry that rather than making progress, the hellish, relentless discrimination of pre-ADA America could become a reality once again for me and for millions of other people with disabilities if Judge Brett Kavanaugh is confirmed to the Supreme Court. Judge Kavanaugh has shown us what he believes about disabled Americans. In Tarlow v. D.C., he ruled that those with mental disabilities shouldnt have the right to make medical decisions about their own bodies. In Baloch v. Kempthorne, he declared that businesses profits are more important than our health. And in Johnson v. Interstate Management Company, he decided that its okay for employers to discriminate against us, too. The cases are different, the plaintiffs change, but one fact remains the same: Judge Kavanaughs rulings make clear that hes just not concerned whether were able to go to school, get decent health care, eat at a restaurant like anyone else or even earn a livable wage. Well, I am. And Im going to fight as hard as I can these next few weeks to make sure that our next Supreme Court justice isnt someone who thinks were less worthy of our rights than able-bodied Americans. But I cant do it alone, which is why Im so lucky to have the disability community at my side, pushing to expand access and protect our rights against attacks from Donald Trump, the Republicans and Judge Kavanaugh. The disability community proved the power that it wields during last years fight to protect the Affordable Care Act. It proved that power again when it helped me lead a group of 43 Senators to block Republican efforts to roll back ADA protections and reward businesses whove failed to comply with the law after nearly 30 years. And when it comes to Judge Kavanaugh, we need to show that same strength 10 times over. Because its not just our health care on the line in this fight  though thats at stake too, as his record suggests that hed vote to take away protections for people with pre-existing conditions. Our civil and voting rights are also on the line, as cases rise through the courts that would make it harder for Americans with disabilities to participate in the democratic process and vote. Womens rights are on the line, as the judge has previously sided against expanding health care access to more womenand would likely be the deciding vote to repeal or roll back Roe v. Wade, putting the government in between women and their doctors. Immigrants rights are on the line. As are LGBTQ rights. As is our economic security and our kids future. Our public schools and our planet, too. Every issue is a disability issue, because our community  at 60 million strong  is beautifully diverse. Thats a gift, but also a responsibility. Because it means we have to fight for every American with disabilities, whether theyre undocumented or disenfranchised or sick and in need of care. No matter what. Truthfully, this confirmation process isnt really about whether some judge can sit in fancy robes in a courtroom in D.C. This is about our most basic rights. And there are only a few weeks left to stop a confirmation that could change our lives forever. So from this moment until the final vote is cast, Im going to be fighting right alongside every other activist with a disability. Working together. Speaking as one. Proving the power of a community that only grows stronger every time someone like Brett Kavanaugh tries to strip us of our rights.",Brett Kavanaugh Would Put Businesses Ahead of Americans With Disabilities on the Supreme Court,http://time.com/5387681/brett-kavanaugh-disabled-rights-supreme-court/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/tammy-duckworth-kavanaugh.jpg?quality=85,left

President Donald Trump praised Judge Brett Kavanaughs progress toward winning confirmation to the Supreme Court but decried the anger and the meanness on the other side, blasting Democrats behavior toward his nominee as sick. During a campaign rally in Montana Thursday, Trump sought to elevate Kavanaughs confirmation as a political litmus test for voters as he embraced a Republican challenger to Democratic Sen. Jon Tester, a top GOP target in the fall elections. Trump also raised the specter of impeachment if Democrats win control of Congress. As he stood alongside Testers opponent, state Auditor Matt Rosendale, Trump said Tester will never drain the swamp because he happens to live in the swamp. Seeking to portray the Montana farmer as a tool of liberal Democrats, Trump said, Jon Tester talks like hes from Montana, but he votes like hes Nancy Pelosi  a reference to the House minority leader, a frequent Trump target. Trump said many of the Senate Democrats whom Tester had helped elect are attacking Judge Kavanaugh and looking like fools. He said Kavanaugh  who is strongly opposed by Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee  deserved overwhelming bipartisan support. Its embarrassing to watch those people make fools of themselves as they scream and shout at this great gentleman, Trump said after three days of committee hearings on the nomination. The presidents strategy on the Supreme Court nomination aims to turn the screws on Tester and Sen. Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, where Trump planned to appear Friday. Both red-state Democrats find themselves caught between their Senate leaders and their states more conservative voters, who are more broadly supportive of Trumps pick. Neither senator has laid down clear markers on how they will vote on Kavanaughs nomination, which Senate Republican leaders hope to bring to a floor vote later this month  just weeks before the Nov. 6 general election. White House officials contend the Supreme Court was a powerful motivator for Republican base voters in 2016, when Trump won the White House, and theyre seeking to capitalize on Kavanaughs nomination to help overcome an enthusiasm gap with Democrats. Likewise, a vote for Kavanaugh by either Tester or Heitkamp could frustrate a Democratic base eager for a more confrontational approach to the Trump administration. Democrats question whether the Kavanaugh vote will resonate in the race to unseat Tester. He has emphasized his independence and willingness to cross the aisle to work with Trump, who carried Montana by 20 percentage points two years ago. Its not like youre standing in the grocery store line and people are talking about the Kavanaugh confirmation. Its pretty inside baseball for folks, said Barrett Kaiser, a Montana-based Democratic strategist. Kaiser said Tester had demonstrated a proven bipartisan record of working with this administration when it helps Montana and oppose them when it doesnt. Tester opposed Trumps first Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch, and the Republican tax bill, but took flak from the left for supporting a bill easing the rules on banks. He has a television ad promoting his collaboration with Trump as he seeks to inoculate himself against conservative critics. Likewise, Heitkamp is locked in a tough re-election fight in heavily Republican North Dakota, where she narrowly won six years ago and now faces a more formidable opponent in Rep. Kevin Cramer. Cramer has been a fervent supporter of Trump, who remains popular in North Dakota. During the rally, Trump claimed Democrats would hurt Social Security and kill Medicare. Trump promised during his 2016 campaign that he would save those programs. Trump also warned that a Democratic-controlled Congress would pursue impeachment despite the strong economy and set a precedent that would hurt future presidents. A few Democratic lawmakers have called for Trump to be removed from office. Lets say a Democrat gets elected and lets say we have a Republican House. We will impeach that Democrat, right? Trump said. Youre going to have a country thats going to turn into a third-world country because if the opposite party becomes president, every time before it even starts, before you even found out whether or not he or she is going to do a great job, theyll say, We want to impeach him!' If it does happen, its your fault because you didnt go out to vote, Trump said. Trump also lit into Tester for his role in torpedoing Trumps nomination of Ronny Jackson to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs. Earlier this year, Tester released unsubstantiated, anonymous allegations against Jackson that accused him of on-the-job drunkenness, overprescribing medication and fostering a hostile work environment. Jackson, a Navy rear admiral who was Trumps personal physician, denied the claims and eventually withdrew his nomination. What Tester did to Admiral Jackson should never, ever be allowed, Trump said, calling the allegations lies.","President Trump Praises Brett Kavanaugh’s Progress, Batting Away Democrats’ Criticisms in Montana",http://time.com/5389724/trump-montana-rally-kavanaugh-progress/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/gettyimages-1028046300.jpg?quality=85,left

Booker said on Thursday morning that he felt compelled to publicly release the documents from Kavanaughs time in the George W.

The documents he released related to his line of questioning for Kavanaugh last night, about an e-mail discussing racial profiling.

Less than a half hour later, his office released the documents. Neither his office nor the Senate Judiciary Committee immediately responded to questions about the possible repercussions for the Senator. The e-mail, dated January 17, 2002, and titled racial profiling, Kavanaugh says he generally favors race neutral security measures, but needs to grapple with the question of what to do in the interim before a truly effective and comprehensive race-neutral system is developed and implemented. Bookers fellow Democrats on the committee immediately jumped to his defense, as did Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. All of these documents belong to the people of the United States, said Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal, who is Bookers committee colleague. They will come out eventually. Bookers decision appears to be a culmination of Democrats anger over the way the documents from Kavanaughs time in the Bush White House has been handled. Kavanaugh served in the White House Counsels office during the Bush Administration and subsequently served as staff secretary. Democrats insisted they should have access to all of the documents from his time as staff secretary, but Republicans demurred. Senate Republicans requested documents from Kavanaughs time in the White House counsel, but Democrats werent satisfied. Their anger only grew after the National Archives said it could not complete the document review until October, leading Republicans to rely on the Bush Presidential library. The documents are now being reviewed  and designated for viewing  by attorney Bill Burck. Burck has represented several figures connected to Trump, including his former strategist and current White House Counsel Don McGahn (who is leaving this fall), causing to Democrats to claim the process is even more partisan. No Senate rule accounts for Bill Burcks review of the documents, said Booker. No Senate rule and no history of the Senate accounts for what is going on right now. In a statement after the documents were released, Burck said Booker had requested publicizing them last night, and he had acquiesced. We were surprised to learn about Senator Bookers histrionics this morning because we had already told him he could use the documents publicly, Burck wrote in an e-mail to TIME. In fact, we have said yes to every request made by the Senate Democrats to make documents public. Republicans immediately dismissed Bookers mechanisms as grandstanding and an open audition for a 2020 presidential campaign. Running for President, said Texas Senator John Cornyn, is no excuse for violating Senate rules.

Long before she decided to come forward, Ford, now 51, had built a new life for herself in Malibu, Honolulu and the San Francisco Bay area, embracing academia, surfing, cheering on the Stanford football team and taking in outdoor rock concerts. Ford settled in the Silicon Valley in the 1990s, when the first wave of the tech boom was transforming lives around her and startups were replacing peach orchards. She began working as a research psychologist and biostatistician at Stanford University, one of the most elite universities in the country. She later was hired as a professor in a consortium between Stanford and Palo Alto University. Soon, she married her husband in a nearby coastal town, and they bought a classic Eichler home in Palo Alto and had two sons. She is very friendly, outgoing and brilliant, and she is a great mother, said clinical psychologist Erin Heinemeyer, a mentee of Fords who is also a friend.

Months after anonymously contacting her elected officials, Ford went public on Sunday telling The Washington Post that Kavanaugh pinned her to a bed at a Maryland house party in the early 1980s and tried to take her clothes off. He put his hand over her mouth when she tried to scream, she said, and she feared he might inadvertently kill her. She said she was around 15 at the time and he would have been about 17. Through the White House, Kavanaugh issued a statement saying he categorically and unequivocally denied the allegation. He is an incredible man. Hes an incredible intellect. He will make an incredible Supreme Court justice, said President Donald Trump on Tuesday. The allegation has shaken up the battle over Kavanaughs confirmation, and Republicans are calling for a public hearing with both accuser and accused testifying. But lawyers for Ford say that she wants an FBI investigation of her allegation in advance of a Judiciary Committee hearing set for Monday. The lawyers said in a letter that Ford wants to cooperate with the panel. But they say that in the days since she gone public with her allegation, she has been the target of vicious harassment and even death threats. Her family has relocated, they said. An FBI investigation should be the first step in addressing the allegations, the lawyers wrote Tuesday in a letter obtained by The Associated Press. Kavanaugh supporters have called Fords credibility and motivations into question. Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, told NBC News that Ford is mixed up, and called Kavanaugh honest and straightforward. Several former colleagues said that, as a biostatistician and psychologist, Ford was known for her scrupulous and meticulous professional conduct. She has published several books and more than 65 peer-reviewed journal articles. Her work often involves analyzing data gathered in medical studies ranging from investigations of new depression treatments to opioid addiction interventions and traumatic brain injury research. Sarah Adler, a former student of Fords who is now a clinical psychologist at Stanford, co-organized a letter in support of her former professor that had been signed by more than 300 colleagues and former students by Tuesday afternoon. Another letter of support has been signed by more than 700 graduates of her private prep school, Holton-Arms. I think she felt morally compelled to come forward, which is very much in line with what I know of her, said Adler. She analyzes the data and lets the data tell the story. Ford values clear professional boundaries and isnt one to share personal struggles with coworkers, the former colleagues said. She never said a word about this, said Allan Reiss, a Stanford professor of psychiatry with whom she has written numerous scholarly publications. But the fact that I know her as a person of integrity and honesty, it doesnt surprise me that she came forward and that she has a personal sense of the importance of what she has to say. It was in couples counseling with her husband in 2012 that she first described an encounter with Kavanaugh in her freshman year of high school, she would later disclose. Friends who knew her from the beach and childrens sports circles said she struggled with the decision to come forward. Shes been trying to forget about this all of her life, basically, Jim Gensheimer, a friend of Fords told The San Jose Mercury News. But she felt like somebody should know what this person was like and what hes done before. Timothy Avery, a former student who is now a postdoctoral research fellow, said he and many others admire her intellect and her kindness on the job. She has reviewed statistics for trials and research being presented to the federal government, Avery said. This all requires a great deal of integrity. Other statisticians review her work, and she reviews theirs. Colleagues and former students described her as competent and laid back, someone who is sure of her own footing and who balances work and family. Even as her appearance before the Senate Judiciary Committee remains up in the air, Avery said he thinks Ford can handle the blazing national spotlight. Its obviously terrible to have to deal with but because her dedication to truth is more important than her personal difficulties, I think she can handle it, he said.",Colleagues Defend Brett Kavanaugh’s Accuser as a Person of Integrity,http://time.com/5400324/christine-blasey-ford-kavanaugh-integrity/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/gettyimages-1034736788.jpg?quality=85,left

In a heated exchange Thursday morning, Democratic Sen. Cory Booker said he would release an email that had been designated committee confidential. That prompted Republican Sen. John Cornyn to snap, Running for President is no excuse for violating the rules of the Senate or of the confidentiality of the documents we are privy to. I dont ever plan on running for president in 2020 or at any point in the future, North Carolina Republican Thom Tillis quipped minutes later when he also criticized Booker. During the past few days of hearings, all eyes have been on Kavanaugh. But hes not the only person being evaluated. Democratic Sens. Booker, Kamala Harris of California and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, all widely considered to be potential presidential contenders in 2020, have each used their time in the highly publicized hearings to maximum effect to lay groundwork for a potential campaign. That has prompted an eye-roll from the Right. Instead of treating the judges hearing seriously, theyre soaking up every minute of camera time to appeal to their far Left base, said RNC spokesman Michael Ahrens. Read More: Can President Trump Pardon Himself? Kavanaugh Wont Say Each senator played a different role in the dramatic piece of political theater. Bookers 2020 persona was one of righteous indignation and idealism. During his lofty opening statement on Tuesday, Booker wound from the special counsel investigation to Russian election meddling to labor rights to healthcare to suicide rates among farmers to dark money to Martin Luther King Jr. to the Three-Fifths Compromise of 1787. Right now millions of American families are watching this in sincere concern and fear, Booker said, wearing a blue tie and sounding every bit the presidential candidate. Ive heard them, Ive gotten the calls, Ive traveled this country. Ive talked to Republicans and Democrats Ive talked to workers all over my state, all over this nation. (Booker also joked that he was a trailblazer because his statement was twice as long as the allotted time.) The following day, Booker zeroed in on racial injustice in his questioning of Kavanaugh, including pressing him on an email about racial profiling, which is the note that had been marked committee confidential that Booker broke the rule to release Thursday morning. Releasing committee confidential documents could result in expulsion from the Senate, but on Thursday Booker called it an act of civil disobedience and challenged Republican Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, Apply the rule. Bring the charges. It was a political dare to expel him in a blaze of glory, sure to endear him to voters on the Left. This is the closest I will ever come to an I am Spartacus moment, Booker said. No matter their stage personas, its clear that Senators Booker and Harris are not actually interested in hearing from the nominee, but rather want to continue giving their 2020 presidential stump speeches, said conservative group Judicial Crisis Networks Chief Counsel Carrie Severino. They are turning their solemn constitutional duty to advise and consent into a made-for-TV circus. It turned out to be even more of a political show than it had first seemed. Hours later, Bill Burck, George W. Bushs representative who led the review of Kavanaughs documents, released a statement saying his office had cleared Bookers release of the email the previous evening. We were surprised to learn of Senator Bookers histrionics this morning because we had already told him he could use the documents publicly, Burck said. Senate Republicans are doing everything they can to distract from their sham process to rush through a Supreme Court justice who will overturn Roe v. Wade, demolish the Affordable Care Act, and protect President Trump from being investigated, said Kristin Lynch, Bookers spokesperson. Cory and Senate Democrats were able to shame the committee into agreeing to make last nights documents publicly available, and Cory publicly released those documents as well as other committee confidential documents today. And hell keep releasing them because Republicans are hiding Brett Kavanaughs record from the American people. If Booker seemed to be raising his hand for 2020 like the top student in class, Klobuchar was giving a more subtle nod from the back of the classroom. Klobuchar, wearing a blue jacket and top, publicly supported Booker during his act of civil disobedience on Thursday, saying that the hearing was ramrodded through for political reasons. And on Wednesday, Klobuchar pointedly used female pronouns to describe the president when she questioned Kavanaugh on hypotheticals about executive power. You said in our meeting that Congress would likely act quickly if the president does something, in your words, dastardly, Klobuchar said. What about a president who commits murder? Or if she jeopardizes national security? Klobuchars office did not response to request for comment. Another woman potentially vying for the top job: Harris. To make her mark on the hearings, Harris demonstrated her past as a prosecutor, highlighting her ability to ask tough questions and make opponents squirm under pressure. In a nearly eight-minute exchange on Wednesday, Harris grilled Kavanaugh on whether he had ever had a conversation with anyone at the law firm Kasowitz, Benson & Torres, which was founded by Donald Trumps lawyer Marc Kasowtiz, about Robert Muellers investigation. As Kavanaugh hesitated, saying he didnt remember, Harris said, Are you saying with all that you remember you have an impeccable memory, youve been speaking for almost 8 hours, I think more, to this committee about all sorts of things you remember how can you not remember whether or not you had a conversation about Robert Mueller or his investigation with anyone at that law firm? This investigation has only been going on for so long, sir.  Later, when Kavanaugh continued to stumble over response, Harris said, I asked the question just a minute ago, Im surprised you forgot. And when he asked if Harris had a specific person in mind that he may have talked to, she replied, I think youre thinking of someone and you dont want to tell us. It was just the sort of tense exchange in which Harris, the former attorney general of California, thrives. Under questioning from Senator Harris and Democrats, Judge Kavanaugh has been evasive, failed to answer simple questions, and demonstrated hes a partisan who has executed a political agenda as a judge, Tyrone Gayle, press secretary for Harris, tells TIME when presented with Ahrens and Severinos comments. Its no wonder they are attempting to attack those who have questioned his record and his views.",Potential 2020 Democratic Candidates Are Taking a Stand at Brett Kavanaugh’s Hearings,http://time.com/5389017/booker-harris-klobuchar-2020-kavanaugh-hearings/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/booker-hearings.jpg?quality=85,left

Leahy. We watched the testimony of Judge Brett Kavanaugh before the Senate Judiciary Committee with dismay and disbelief. His many misleading and false statements cast serious doubt on whether he should be confirmed to a seat on the U.S. Supreme Court. The events of this weekend only make it clearer the Senate must not act in haste. At the very least, the Senate should not vote on his nomination until still-secret documents from his time in the George W. Bush White House are made public and until the sexual misconduct allegations that have just become public are thoroughly investigated. This is not about the dance many nominees attempt in order to avoid expressing an opinion on legal issues they might face on the court. It is about a pattern of deceptive answers on a range of questions about his past activities and agenda to change our laws through the courts. We believe this deception, both earlier this month and in his 2004 and 2006 nomination hearings for the D.C. Circuit, was intentional. His truthfulness, of course, is very much at issue in the latest allegations against him, since he has categorically denied the sexual assault of which he is accused. Kavanaughs nomination to the D.C. Circuit in July 2003 was highly controversial because of his role in very partisan matters, including judicial nominations. Emails revealed during the hearing, and some just a few weeks before, show that he went to great lengths to mislead Senators in 2004 and 2006 about his true role in those matters, as well as his knowledge of and reliance on confidential information about the strategy of Democratic Senators, whose files had been stolen by Manuel Miranda. Miranda, who worked closely with Kavanaugh on judicial nominations, was at the time a Republican staffer for Sen. Orrin Hatch and then the nominations counsel for Majority Leader Bill Frist. This is important because the American people need judges who are honest on both the facts and the law. Kavanaughs deception was about files that were stolen from the Senate itself and about his role promoting judicial nominees with very controversial records that caused their nominations to stall. Kavanaughs sworn testimony goes to the heart of the question of whether he should be entrusted with a lifetime job on our highest court. He should not. Mirandas thefts over the period from December 2001 through early April 2003 were as serious an incident as we experienced during our congressional service  police tape was wrapped around the committee server room when the thefts were discovered. And an extensive report on the incident was issued by Senate Sergeant-at-Arms William Pickle in March 2004 the month before the Judiciary Committees first hearing on Kavanaughs nomination to the D.C. Circuit. Makan Delrahim, who President Donald Trump appointed last year to head the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice, worked for Hatch at the time of the theft. In connection with his nomination hearing, he said, I find the misconduct described in the [Pickle Report] to be completely inappropriate, do not excuse it, and deeply regret that any such conduct by Senate Judiciary Committee staff occurred. Chairman Hatch, Delrahims boss, concurred at the time of the report, saying in March 2004, I am mortified that this improper, unethical, simply unacceptable breach of confidential files occurred. At his first confirmation hearing in April 2004, Kavanaugh said he had never received material stolen from Democrats. He repeated that testimony in May 2006 under questioning by both Democratic Senators and Chairman Hatch. But emails released earlier this month, after originally being deemed committee confidential, show that Kavanaugh was in frequent contact with Miranda and received material that had been stolen from the Senate Judiciary Committee server. These emails contradict his testimony under oath. When confronted by Senator Leahy in the 2018 hearing, Kavanaugh stood by his earlier testimony, claiming that he never suspected the material he received was stolen and even arguing that it was common for the White House to receive strategic materials, like confidential letters or talking points, of Democratic staff. He repeated the claim that it was typical multiple times. He even testified: It seemed like a lot of times the staff was cooperating at times  about judicial nominations. And so, it would not have raised anything in particular in my mind if we learned, Oh, Senator Leahy is concerned about this. As former staffers who were there at the time, we find this testimony preposterous. While Democrats and Republicans worked together on non-controversial legislation and nominations, the fights over nominees Senators did oppose strongly  such as Miguel Estrada, Priscilla Owen, Bill Pryor and Charles Pickering  were full-fledged and often bitter on both sides. To suggest it would have been common to receive contents or descriptions of our memos, talking points, letters and other items about Democratic Senators strategies on how to defeat these highly controversial nominees is ridiculous. This is yet another deceptive claim by this nominee. Kavanaugh also misled the Senate in his 2006 nomination hearing about his involvement in pushing controversial nominees like Pryor and Pickering. Then, he said the Pryor nomination was not one that he had worked on personally, and that the Pickering nomination was not one that he had primarily handled. He denied awareness of Pryors incendiary comments that Roe v. Wade was the worst abomination in the history of constitutional law, and of Pickerings unethical solicitation of recommendation letters from lawyers with cases pending before him as a trial judge. But this no longer appears true. The limited number of documents now available show that Kavanaugh interviewed and recommend Pryor for the 11th Circuit defended Pryors record to the Washington Post, drafted letters and prepared background material for Senators and their senior staff on Pickering, coordinated strategy with the Justice Department and the Judiciary Committee, and took part in or was invited to meetings about the nominees, including with Pickerings son and other top supporters. All of this was known to Kavanaugh when he testified under oath in 2004 and 2006, but it was not known to Senators until emails contradicting his testimony were released this year. That Kavanaugh was pushing to nominate someone who made statements like Judge Pryor did about Roe v. Wade certainly casts doubt on his statement in 2004 that he rarely had knowledge of nominees ideological views Whether any of these statements should be the subject of federal charges for perjury or impeachment proceedings is a question for prosecutors, the courts and Congress. What is clear now, however, is that Brett Kavanaugh knew what he was being asked in his hearings and was intentionally evasive and misleading in his answers to questions under oath. Why would he do that? Because downplaying his participation in the most partisan and hard-fought judicial nominations of that period was a key part of the effort to secure his own spot on the federal bench. Had the documents that are now available to the public been seen by Senators in 2006, he very well might never have been confirmed to the D.C. Circuit. It is crucial to note that the Senate still does not have access to all of Kavanaughs records on these matters. The National Archives has estimated that it has millions of pages of documents from his time as a political appointee in the Bush White House. We simply do not know whats still being hidden from the committee and the American people about these and other issues. What we do know is that Kavanaughs former Deputy, Bill Burck, has asserted a blanket claim of privilege on over 100,000 pages of documents, including those about Kavanaughs work on Bush judicial candidates. We are unaware of any previous time where executive privilege has been used to block the release of documents to the Senate during a Supreme Court nomination. It would be unprecedented and unwise for the Senate to act on the nomination without reviewing the full record. Furthermore, especially in light of the serious and credible charges that became public this weekend, it would be irresponsible for the Senate to rush this nominee to a vote with so many unresolved questions about his honesty and integrity. To uphold the integrity of the U.S. Senates nomination process, and maintain the integrity of the U.S. Supreme Court, Judge Brett Kavanaughs nomination must not move forward.",Brett Kavanaugh Can’t Be Trusted.

As you know, earlier this summer, Dr. Ford sought to tell her story, in confidence, so that lawmakers would have a fuller understanding of Brett Kavanaughs character and history. Only after the details of her experience were leaked did Dr. Ford make the reluctant decision to come forward publicly. In the 36 hours since her name became public, Dr. Ford has received a stunning amount of support from her community and from fellow citizens across our country. At the same time, however, her worst fears have materialized. She has been the target of vicious harassment and even death threats. As a result of these kind of threats, her family was forced to relocate out of their home. Her email has been hacked, and she has been impersonated online. While Dr. Fords life was being turned upside down, you and your staff scheduled a public hearing for her to testify at the same table as Judge Kavanaugh in front of two dozen U.S. Senators on national television to relive this traumatic and harrowing incident. The hearing was scheduled for six short days from today and would include interrogation by Senators who appear to have made up their minds that she is mistaken and mixed up. While no sexual assault survivor should be subjected to such an ordeal, Dr. Ford wants to cooperate with the Committee and with law enforcement officials. As the Judiciary Committee has recognized and done before, an FBI investigation of the incident should be the first step in addressing her allegations. A full investigation by law enforcement officials will ensure that the crucial facts and witnesses in this matter are assessed in a non-partisan manner, and that the Committee is fully informed before conducting any hearing or making any decisions.

Doubts were even raised whether she would appear. Meanwhile, Kavanaugh was at the White House for a second straight day. Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, said on radios Hugh Hewitt Show that hed not yet received confirmation from the accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, that she would appear, despite several attempts to reach her camp. So it kind of raises the question, do they want to come to the public hearing or not? Grassley said. A day earlier, Republican abruptly agreed to hold a public Judiciary Committee hearing at which Kavanaugh and Ford have been invited to testify. Party leaders made that concession under pressure from senators demanding that the nominee and his accuser give public, sworn testimony before any vote on President Donald Trumps nominee. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Democrats want more than two witnesses, including Mark Judge, who Ford has said was a Kavanaugh friend present during the alleged incident. Limiting the hearing to just Kavanaugh and Ford would be inadequate, unfair, wrong and a desire not to get at the whole truth, Schumer said. He also said the FBI should be given time to reopen its background investigation into Kavanaugh so it could check Fords assertions. And he said the Judiciary Committee should not rush the nomination through by voting on Kavanaugh a day or two after Mondays hearing. As both sides contemplated the hearing, Republicans were thinking through the optics of a nationally televised showdown between Kavanaugh and his accuser at which all 11 GOP Judiciary Committee members are men. The hearing is certain to be conflicting and emotive. It will offer a campaign season test of the political potency of a #MeToo movement that has already toppled prominent men from entertainment, government and journalism and energized female voters and political candidates. Asked by Hewitt if he was considering including a female counsel who would ask questions, Grassley said, All those things are being taken into consideration. He added later, Youre raising legitimate questions that are still in my mind. Meanwhile, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell stood strongly behind Brett Kavanaugh, saying her claims that hed sexually attacked her when both were high schoolers stands at odds with everything known about the Supreme Court nominees background. McConnell said that blatant malpractice by Democrats  not releasing a letter by the accuser until the confirmation process was nearing its end  will not stop the Senate from moving forward in a responsible manner. The remarks by McConnell, R-Ky., seemed aimed at signaling that while Ford will be given her opportunity to detail her allegations under oath, party leaders  certainly for now  were not easing off their support of President Donald Trumps nominee. Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, who received Fords letter over the summer, said she didnt reveal it to protect Fords confidentiality. Kavanaugh spoke with the Judiciary panels counsel Monday and gave a clear and consistent account of what happened 36 years ago, said a person who wasnt authorized to be identified while describing the process. The person described Kavanaugh as resolute and eager to defend himself. Kavanaugh met Monday with White House Counsel Don McGahn and others at the White House and called several senators. Ford says that at a party when both were teenagers in the early 1980s, an intoxicated Kavanaugh trapped her in a bedroom, pinned her on a bed, tried to undress her and forced his hand over her mouth when she tried to scream. She said she got away when a companion of Kavanaughs jumped on him. Kavanaugh, 53, has vehemently denied the accusation. He said in a statement Monday that he wanted to refute this false allegation, from 36 years ago, and defend my integrity. If the Judiciary committees timetable slips, it would become increasingly difficult for Republicans to schedule a vote before midterm elections on Nov. 6 elections, when congressional control will be at stake. With fragile GOP majorities of just 11-10 on the Judiciary committee and 51-49 in the full Senate, Republican leaders had little room for defectors without risking a humiliating defeat of Trumps nominee to replace retired Justice Anthony Kennedy. Among the GOP defectors was Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona, a Judiciary Committee member who has clashed bitterly with Trump and is retiring from the Senate. Flake said he told No. 2 Senate Republican leader John Cornyn of Texas on Sunday that if we didnt give her a chance to be heard, then I would vote no. There was enormous pressure on GOP Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, two moderates who have yet to announce their positions on Kavanaugh and arent on the Judiciary Committee. Collins said that in a telephone conversation with Kavanaugh on Friday he was absolutely emphatic that the assault didnt occur. She said it would be disqualifying if Kavanaugh was lying. Murkowski said Fords story must be taken seriously. Neither Collins nor Murkowski faces re-election this fall. Democrats say they want the FBI to investigate Fords claims. But the Justice Department said in a statement late Monday that the accusation against Kavanaugh does not involve any potential federal crime. It said the FBI had forwarded to the White House a letter, evidently from Ford, describing alleged misconduct in the 1980s by Kavanaugh. The statement seemed to suggest that the FBI was not currently investigating it. Ford is now a psychology professor at Californias Palo Alto University. Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, widely viewed as the nations second-most-powerful court.",Senate Democrats and GOP Can’t Agree on Who Will Testify at Kavanaugh’s Sexual Assault Accusation Hearing,http://time.com/5399722/senate-democrats-gop-kavanaugh-supreme-court-sexual-assault-accusation/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/gop-democrats-senators-kavanaugh-hearing.jpg?quality=85,left

So far, around 3,000 coat hangers have been sent to the Senators office in Maine over the course of a few months, according to the Associated Press. The coat hangers symbolize the danger of making abortion illegal again, serving as a reminder of the back-alley abortions that women resorted to before Roe v. Wade became settled law in 1973. Many fear that, if confirmed, Kavanaugh would work to overturn the established court case. Collins is a crucial swing vote in Kavanaughs confirmation to the court, along with Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski. Confirming a Supreme Court nominee takes just 51 votes and Republicans currently hold 51 seats. Either Collins or Murkowski, who are seen as more pro-choice than many other Republican Senators, could be the deciding vote in whether Kavanaugh is appointed to the court.  Collins has previously said she would not support a nominee that would not uphold Roe v. Wade. She also told reporters that Kavanaugh reassured her by saying he considers Roe v. Wade settled law, but in a 2003 email recently unearthed at his confirmation hearings he wrote he was not sure whether the case was settled law. People have been sending coat hangers to Collins office since July, when Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy announced his retirement. President Donald Trump has said if he is able to put a second or third justice on the court  he nominated Neil Gorsuch to the court earlier this year  Roe v.

Kamala Harris, who asked him about the thousands of pages shed received the night before. We have not had an opportunity to review, or read or analyze, she said. We cannot possibly proceed. Youre out of order, Grassley told Harris. But Harris persisted in pushing for delaying the hearing to review the documents. As Grassley continued to try reading his opening statement, every other Democrat on the committee, with the exception of ranking member Dianne Feinstein, who stayed above the procedural fray, followed Harris lead, calling for the hearing to be adjourned because they lacked the necessary information to make a decision. What is the rush? What are we trying to hide by not having the documents out front? What are we hiding by not letting these documents come out? Democratic Sen. Cory Booker asked Grassley. The partisan infighting over the seemingly mundane topic of document release isnt new; its been the primary focus for Senate Democrats, led by minority leader Chuck Schumer, for nearly two months. Kavanaugh served in the White House Counsels office during the Bush Administration subsequently served as staff secretary; his paper trail was always going to be longer than any of the other nominees the President was considering after Justice Anthony Kennedy resigned from his position in June. Democrats said they wanted to see all of the documents from his time as White House staff secretary before the hearings, but Republicans did not request those documents, arguing they were irrelevant to his nomination. Although Senate Repulicans did ask for documents from Kavanaughs time in the White House counsel, the Democrats werent satisfied. The tension was only exacerbated after the National Archives said it would be unable to release all of the documents that the Senate had requested from Kavanaughs time in the White House counsel before October. Senate Republicans, who want to confirm Kavanaugh before the Supreme Court starts its new term in October, have instead been relying on the documents to be released through the Bush presidential library after they were reviewed by attorney William Burck, a process Democrats have deemed too partisan. Democrats still have an uphill battle to derail Kavanaughs nomination. Republicans need just 50 votes  their entire conference at the moment  to clear Kavanaughs nomination. The two Senators the Democrats had pinned their hopes on, Alaskas Lisa Murkowski and Maines Susan Collins, dont appear to have given any indication they wont vote with their party. Additionally, several Democratic Senators are facing reelection battles in states where Trump won by double digits in 2016, meaning a vote against Kavanaugh could be potentially toxic for them. And on Tuesday, Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey announced he would appoint former Republican Sen. Jon Kyl to fill the late Sen. John McCains seat, giving Republicans even more of a cushion. But on Tuesday, Democrats were finally given a chance to tell the public why they are so intent on reviewing certain documents. During your time in the White House, when you were staff secretary  some people regard it as kind of a monitor, monitoring things going in and going out. But I think its much more, Feinstein told Kavanaugh in her opening statement. .And you yourself have said that thats the period of my greatest growth. And so we try to look at it. And the only way we can look at it is to understand the documents and its very, very difficult.",Democrats Put Brett Kavanaugh’s Time in the White House in the Spotlight,http://time.com/5386461/brett-kavanaugh-confirmation-hearings-bush/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/cm_kavanaugh_dc_09_04_18_0835.jpg?quality=85,left

The decision, which will likely push back the confirmation timeline  the committee was expected to vote on Kavanaughs nomination this coming Thursday  came one day after Ford publicly identified herself in an interview with the Washington Post as the woman who had written a letter to Sen. Dianne Feinstein describing her alleged ordeal with Kavanaugh when they were in high school. Ford told the Post Sunday that she and Kavanaugh were at a high school house party in the 1980s when Kavanaugh, who she says had been drinking, pinned her to a bed and groped her in an effort to pull off her clothes. When she tried to scream, Ford told the Post that Kavanaugh put his hand over her mouth. As I said earlier, anyone who comes forward as Dr. Ford has done deserves to be heard . to provide ample transparency, we will hold a public hearing Monday to give these recent allegations a full airing, Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley said in a statement Monday evening announcing the evening. Kavanaugh, who has denied the incident ever occurred, had said in a statement released through the White House Monday that he was willing to testify as soon as possible. Fords attorney, Debra Katz, said Monday morning on cable television that her client was willing to do so as well. She did not immediately respond to request from comment for TIME.  Grassleys decision capped off a hectic day in the Senate that was filled with calls from senators on both sides of the aisle who wanted to hear from both Ford and Kavanaugh about the elections. Those pushing for testimony included Sens. Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski, two members of the Republican conference Democrats have targeted as possibilities for bucking the party line and voting against Kavanaugh. Allegations surrounding sexual assault must be taken seriously and the Judiciary Committee must look into this further. Despite the length of time since the alleged incident, Dr. Fords allegations should be heard and she must have an opportunity to present her story before the committee under oath, with Judge Kavanaugh having the opportunity to respond under oath as well, Murkowski said in a statement Monday. Collins said it would it be disqualifying if Kavanaugh had lied about the allegations, but said she did not have information to asses the veracity of Fords allegations.  I believe in order for me to assess the credibility of these allegations that I want to have both individuals come before the senate judiciary committee and testify under oath, she told reporters in the Capitol Monday. Feinsteins office did not immediately respond to request for comment. All of the Democrats on the judiciary committee sent a letter to Grassley earlier in the day asking to delay the hearing until the FBI conducted a thorough investigation. At the end of the day, they had also sent a letter to White House Counsel Don McGahn to ask the FBI to re-open Kavanaughs background check. And Democrats refused to attend the meeting where judiciary staffers questioned Kavanaugh on the allegations, claiming the efforts werent sufficient. When asked earlier in the day if committee Democrats would be satisfied with a hearing instead of re-opening an FBI investigation, a spokesperson for Feinstein said the focus was on the FBI and declined to discuss any hypotheticals.",Senate to Hold Public Hearing for Brett Kavanaugh and Accuser Christine Blasey Ford,http://time.com/5398806/senate-public-hearing-kavanaugh-accuser-christine-blasey-ford/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/collins-kavanaugh-testify.jpg?quality=85,left

I thought he might inadvertently kill me, Ford, now 51, told the Post. He was trying to attack me and remove my clothing. Kavanaugh has denied Fords allegation. I categorically and unequivocally deny this allegation. I did not do this back in high school or at any time, he said in a statement. Senator Dianne Feinstein, the leading Democrat on the committee overseeing Kavanaughs confirmation, has called Fords allegation extremely serious and that they bear heavily on Judge Kavanaughs character. Feinstein received a letter detailing Fords claim in July, but the allegation contained therein was not widely known until last week. While Democrats and numerous protestors have tried to delay or derail Kavanaughs nomination process, the Trump-nominated judges eventual ascension to the Supreme Court was seen as inevitable given Republicans control of the Senate. However, Fords allegation could lead the Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee to reconsider their support for Kavanaugh.

There is no way to redo 1991, but there are ways to do better, Hill wrote in a New York Times column on Tuesday. Christine Blasey Ford accused Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her nearly four decades ago at a high school party. Both are now slated to testify at a public hearing on Monday  a situation that has elicited comparisons to Hills testimony, where she faced intense scrutiny and changed the national conversation about sexual harassment. Kavanaugh has denied the allegation, calling it completely false. Today, the public expects better from our government than we got in 1991, when our representatives performed in ways that gave employers permission to mishandle workplace harassment complaints throughout the following decades, Hill wrote in the Times. That the Senate Judiciary Committee still lacks a protocol for vetting sexual harassment and assault claims that surface during a confirmation hearing suggests that the committee has learned little from the Thomas hearing, much less the more recent #MeToo movement. Hill noted some of the members that were on the Senate Judiciary Committee when she testified in 1991 are still on the committee including Vermont Sen. Patrick Leahy, Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch and Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley. She urged the Senate Judiciary Committee not to pit the need for a fair confirmation hearing against the need to confront sexual harassment, calling for a neutral investigative body with experience in sexual misconduct cases to investigate Fords accusation. She also said Senators should rely on those investigative conclusions and expert advice when framing their questions. The investigators report should frame the hearing, not politics or myths about sexual assault, Hill wrote. She urged Senators not to rush the hearings, warning that a Monday deadline does not allow enough time for meaningful inquiry into very serious charges.  In 1991, the phrase they just dont get it became a popular way of describing senators reaction to sexual violence, Hill wrote. With years of hindsight, mounds of evidence of the prevalence and harm that sexual violence causes individuals and our institutions, as well as a Senate with more women than ever, not getting it isnt an option for our elected representatives.

The lawyers wrote that Ford, who is now a college professor in California, wants to cooperate with the committee. But in the days since she publicly accused Kavanaugh of the assault when they were teens at a party 35 years ago, the lawyers said, she has been the target of vicious harassment and even death threats. Her family has relocated, they said. An FBI investigation should be the first step in addressing the allegations, the lawyers wrote in the letter, which was obtained by The Associated Press. The development comes after President Donald Trump showered sympathy on his embattled nominee and as Senate Republicans and Democrats fought determinedly over who should testify at a high-stakes hearing on the allegation just six weeks before major congressional elections. Trump has already rejected the idea of bringing in the FBI to reopen its background check of Kavanaugh. Should he order such a review, it would likely delay a confirmation vote until after the election. Republicans hope to have Kavanaugh confirmed by Oct. 1, the start of the next Supreme Court term. Meanwhile, Republicans are suggesting that Ford, whose allegations have upended Kavanaughs nomination  the committees vote was already pushed from Thursday to likely next week  will have one chance to testify, and one chance only. Monday is her opportunity, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said Tuesday, a line that was echoed by other Republicans throughout the day. McConnell expressed confidence that Kavanaugh would be confirmed. Im not concerned about tanking the nomination, he said. We should proceed as planned, said Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, a key Republican on the panel. The furious jockeying over Fords testimony underscores the political potency so close to an election that will decide control of both the House and Senate, not to mention the confirmation of a conservative justice likely to serve on the high court for decades. Democrats complain that Ford was not consulted before the hearing was announced. They also want more witnesses besides Kavanaugh and Ford, hoping to avoid what they said would turn into a he-said-she-said moment. The lawyers for Ford predicted the hearing, as now scheduled, would include interrogation by senators who appear to have made up their minds that she is mistaken and mixed up. But Democrats also said Tuesday they were planning to attend the hearing even if Ford did not show up. Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said he had a lot of questions for Kavanaugh. A simple denial is not the end of questioning. As Democrats press for more time to investigate, Republicans have been careful to say that Ford should have her chance to speak, and they have stressed that they are willing to move Mondays hearing behind closed doors, if she prefers. Were planning on a hearing Monday. It can be open. It can be closed, whatever Ms. Ford wants, said Sen. John Kennedy, a member of the Judiciary panel from Louisiana. Were ready to hear anything she has to say. I am, anyway, and I think most of us are. GOP Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee  among a handful of Republicans who insisted on hearing from Ford before voting  said it would be a shame if Ford didnt show up to testify. But he suggested Republicans will not bend from their offer of a hearing Monday. That would be quite something if she decided she did not want to testify, Corker said. Id assume the committee would then move on as they should. One witness the Democrats want to hear from is Kavanaughs high school friend Mark Judge, who Ford said was in the room when she was assaulted. Kavanaugh has denied Fords allegation, and Judge says he doesnt remember any such thing. More to the point, I never saw Brett act in the manner Dr. Ford describes, Judge said in a letter to the panel. The risks of a public hearing starring the all-male lineup of Republicans on the committee could be high. Republicans said late Tuesday they were considering hiring outside attorneys, presumably including women, to question the witnesses. But that may be moot if Ford declines to appear. Kavanaugh, 53, was at the White House on Tuesday for a second straight day, but again did not meet with Trump. The president said he was totally supporting Kavanaugh and felt terribly for him and his family. I feel so badly for him that hes going through this, to be honest with you, I feel so badly for him, said Trump, who has himself faced numerous accusations of sexual harassment that hes denied. This is not a man that deserves this. The No. 2 Senate Republican leader, John Cornyn of Texas, was one of the few Republicans who openly questioned Fords version of events. He called the allegations a drive-by attack on the judges character. There are gaps in her memory, Cornyn said. She doesnt know how she got there, when it was and so that would logically be something where she would get questions. Criticism like that fed a Democratic narrative that the GOPs handling of Ford could jeopardize that partys election prospects in the age of #MeToo, the response to sexual abuse that has torched the careers of prominent men. Now this is really what #MeToo is all about, if you think about it, said Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, the top Judiciary Committee Democrat. Thats sort of the first thing that happens, its the womans fault. And it is not the womans fault. Meanwhile, Kavanaugh has been calling Republican senators, including Kennedy, who said the nominee was committed to moving forward. Hes not happy, hes upset, Kennedy said. He said very clearly and unequivocally, This did not happen.' Ford went public with her story Sunday, telling The Washington Post that Kavanaugh had forced himself on her in a bedroom at a party when he was 17 and she was 15, attempting to remove her clothes and clapping his hand over her mouth when she tried to scream. She says she escaped when Judge jumped on the bed.",Brett Kavanaugh’s Accuser Wants the FBI to Investigate Before She Testifies,http://time.com/5400226/brett-kavanaugh-accuser-fbi-probe/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/gettyimages-10282632321.jpg?quality=85,left

By Peter H. Schuck Mr. Schuck is an emeritus professor of law at Yale. Commentary on Supreme Court nominations these days is more akin to sportscasters announcing a close baseball game: The liberals and conservatives are tied going into the bottom of the ninth. Brett Kavanaugh, a promising rookie pitcher with a strong minor league record, is coming in to replace the streaky Anthony Kennedy. When Kennedy was hot, the conservatives won, but when he slumped, the liberals could squeeze by. Kavanaugh seems a lot steadier than Kennedy. This way of handicapping Supreme Court nominees has a definite allure. We all love a horse race, and politics often seems like one. But for court nominations, sports analogies are dangerously misleading. It is true that knowing the party of the president and the nominee provides a strong indication of how the nominee will later vote in cases of sharp partisan differences on the underlying policy issue  for example, the recent Janus v. Afscme decision barring a union from imposing agency fees on nonmembers.  But in 75 percent of cases, partisan affiliation is not fully predictive of justices votes. In the hardest ones, lower courts reached different results despite seeing the same evidence, and considering the same legal arguments. This week, senators should spend less time grandstanding with questions that simply highlight Judge Kavanaughs well-known ideological positions, and a lot more time trying to assess how he would vote in these much trickier cases. What accounts for these circuit splits? In hard cases, excellent legal arguments (not just ideological ones) can be made on both sides, often because the relevant legal principles are unclear or conflicting. Also, judges (and administrative agencies initially) can reasonably interpret the key facts differently. The competing values (there may be more than two) may be compelling. Most justices care about a decisions legal and social consequences, yet in hard cases these effects may be opaque and unpredictable  perhaps because they depend on what the states decide to do.  In some hard cases  Brown v. Board of Education or same-sex marriage, for example  the legal and social landscape may have shifted so much that even conservative justices, who normally resist living Constitution arguments, may take these changes into account. In clashes between national security and individual rights claims (e.g., the recent travel ban decision), even liberal justices may defer to the governments judgment. And it is hard to predict how courts will apply the multiple criteria  what Judge Kavanaugh referred to in his testimony this week as precedents on precedents  for deciding when precedents may be overturned. This is why even some conservative justices may resist overturning Roe v. Wade. (They may try to eviscerate it in other ways, of course.)  And, of course, even on the Supreme Court, politics has a way of trumping ideology in unpredictable ways. Who would have expected that Chief Justice John Roberts would seek out a way to rescue the Affordable Care Act in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius? Media and politicians have traditionally tended to ignore these complexities, preferring to depict a Manichaean liberal/conservative battle for legal supremacy. This perverse ideological focus hides or denies the fascinating interplay among legal doctrine, textual interpretation and the factual record in determining outcomes. It also crowds out the more revealing lawyerly divisions among the justices about what should matter in resolving hard cases  for example, the relative importance of national uniformity versus local diversity, of clear rules versus more contextual standards, of government authority versus individual rights, of deference to elected officials versus bureaucratic expertise, of the default rules for interpreting ambiguous language, and so forth.  Ideological labels are even misleading in their own terms. Real judges (like real people) mix liberalism on some issues with conservatism on others. For example, even the arch-conservative Antonin Scalia voted with liberals to uphold punitive jury awards against product manufacturers, adopting the position advocated by the trial lawyers (a leading Democratic lobby), because he thought the Constitution permits such awards.  The labels also reveal little about what should be our real concerns: the mix of values underlying them. For example, is a law-and-order conservative callous toward the life challenges faced by poor people, or instead sensitive to the depredations that crime inflicts on their communities? Is race-based affirmative action a policy that levels the playing field for all or instead one that advantages some minorities over others?  None of this means that partisan decision patterns dont exist. But it does argue for a more nuanced view of a nominee, one that includes factors beyond partisanship. President Trump has selected the kind of reliably conservative jurist that one would expect any Republican president to nominate. Judge Kavanaughs right-wing supporters and left-wing opponents are equally keen to portray him as a guaranteed vote to overrule Roe and other liberal shibboleths, but hard cases often cause justices to confound ideological expectations. John Paul Stevens, David Souter and Anthony Kennedy, all justices nominated by Republican presidents, took the liberal side in important cases. (Such unexpected shifts have probably become less likely with more intensive ideological screening by outside groups.) Once confirmed, Judge Kavanaugh will enjoy total independence from any president. Had a normal president nominated him rather than a bizarre, lawless one, this nomination would be no more controversial than, say, Elena Kagans  another superbly qualified choice. Unless the Democrats come up with something disqualifying, he should be confirmed.  Peter H.

By Paul Krugman Opinion Columnist At a fundamental level, the attempt to jam Brett Kavanaugh onto the Supreme Court closely resembles the way Republicans passed a tax cut last year. Once again we see a rushed, nakedly partisan process, with G.O.P. leaders withholding much of the information thats supposed to go into congressional deliberations. Once again the outcome is all too likely to rest on pure tribalism: Unless some Republicans develop a very late case of conscience, they will vote along party lines with the full knowledge that theyre abdicating their constitutional duty to provide advice and consent. True, Kavanaugh is at least getting a hearing, which the tax bill never did. But hes bobbing and weaving his way through, refusing to answer even straightforward questions, displaying an evasiveness utterly at odds with the probity we used to expect of Supreme Court justices. No, the real difference from the tax bill story is that last year we were talking only about a couple of trillion dollars. This year were talking about the future of the Republic. For a Kavanaugh confirmation will set us up for multiple constitutional crises. After all, if Kavanaugh is confirmed, we will be trying to navigate a turbulent era in American politics with a Supreme Court in which two seats were effectively stolen. First Republicans refused even to give President Barack Obamas nominee so much as a hearing; then they will have filled two positions with nominees chosen by a president who lost the popular vote and eked out an Electoral College win only with aid from a hostile foreign power.  [Receive the days most urgent debates right in your inbox by subscribing to the Opinion Today newsletter.]  Would a Justice Kavanaugh conduct himself with the caution appropriate to such a fraught situation? Well, miracles of personal redemption do happen. But its very unlikely. On the contrary, every indication is that if he makes it, he and his fellow justices will abuse their power at every level. After all, what do we know about Kavanaugh? Theres a lot we dont know, thanks to the unprecedented way Republicans and the Trump administration are stonewalling on thousands of pages of his records. And whats in those hidden records must be really damning, given what we already know  a record that would, in normal times, be more than enough to rule him out as a potential member of the nations highest court. Remember, Kavanaugh cut his teeth working for the Starr investigation into Bill Clinton  a genuine witch hunt that consumed seven years and tens of millions of dollars without finding any evidence of wrongdoing. And he personally spent years obsessively pursuing crazy conspiracy theories about the suicide of Vince Foster. Then he spent time working in the George W. Bush White House, which made torture a routine part of policy. In his 2006 confirmation hearing for an appellate court judgeship he declared that he played no role in those decisions. Was he telling the truth? The answer might lie in those thousands of pages of records the Trump administration is refusing to release.  Strange to say, however, he emerged from that experience as someone who believes that presidents cant be subject to legal investigations. Meanwhile, Kavanaugh accumulated a record as an appellate judge  one that places him far to the right on everything from the environment, to labor rights, to discrimination. His anti-labor views are especially extreme, even for a conservative. So who is Brett Kavanaugh? If he looks like a right-wing apparatchik and quacks like a right-wing apparatchik, hes almost surely a right-wing apparatchik. Which brings us to the coming constitutional crises. The immediate question is how the court will handle Donald Trumps obstruction of justice, which is likely to reach epic levels very soon. If you think Kavanaugh wouldnt completely support Trump, I have some miracle dietary supplements you might want to buy. Beyond that, what will happen if we eventually get a Democratic Congress and president, who try to move forward with a center-left agenda? What I mean by that, by the way, are things like expanding health coverage and raising taxes on high incomes  things that arent radical, and in fact have broad popular support. Theres every reason to believe that a court including Kavanaugh would strike down everything elected officials tried to do. Policy substance aside, this would destroy the courts legitimacy, making its naked partisanship  based, again, on two stolen seats  clear to all. But it would probably happen anyway. In fact, the constitutional carnage might well begin as soon as next year. We know that if Republicans hold on in the midterms theyll quickly move to destroy Obamacare and take insurance away from millions. But even if they lose, what are the odds that if Kavanaugh is confirmed, the court will find some excuse to declare the Affordable Care Act unconstitutional? Surely theyre pretty high. So let me make a last-minute appeal to Republican senators who care about Americas future, if there are any left: Dont do this. A vote for Kavanaugh will be a vote to destroy the legitimacy of one of the last federal institutions standing.

Now hes being rammed through his confirmation process with an unprecedented degree of secrecy and partisan maneuvering by Republican senators who, despite their overflowing praise for his legal acumen and sterling credentials, appear terrified for the American people to find out much of anything about him beyond his penchant for coaching girls basketball.  Perhaps most concerning, Judge Kavanaugh seems to have trouble remembering certain important facts about his years of service to Republican administrations. More than once this week, he testified in a way that appeared to directly contradict evidence in the record.  For example, he testified that Roe v. Wade is settled as a precedent of the Supreme Court. But he said essentially the opposite in a 2003 email leaked to The Times. I am not sure that all legal scholars refer to Roe as the settled law of the land at the Supreme Court level since Court can always overrule its precedent, and three current Justices on the Court would do so, he wrote then. Judge Kavanaughs backers in the Senate brushed this off by pointing out that his 2003 statement was factually correct. Theyre right, which means that his testimony this week was both disingenuous and meaningless. As weve learned with each new trickle of previously withheld documents, Judge Kavanaugh didnt start misleading senators just this week.  At his 2004 confirmation hearing before the Judiciary Committee, he denied any involvement in the vetting of a controversial judicial nominee while serving as one of President George W. Bushs White House lawyers. The nominee, William Pryor Jr., had among other things called Roe v. Wade the worst abomination of constitutional law in our history. In fact, Mr. Kavanaugh was more than a little involved, as emails from that period  which Senate Republicans had withheld until early Thursday morning  made clear. In that 2004 hearing and again in 2006, when he was being considered for a seat on the federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., Mr. Kavanaugh told Congress, under oath, that he knew nothing about the extensive theft of secret strategy documents from Democratic senators computers by Republican staffers. As it turns out, he did in fact receive those documents or summaries of them. But he now claims that he had no reason to believe that they had been stolen, even though one email he got had the subject line spying and began, I have a friend who is a mole for us on the left.  Then there are the persistent doubts about his truthfulness in telling senators in 2006 that he had no knowledge of Mr. Bushs warrantless wiretapping program or his detainee treatment policy  claims that have been called into question by yet more emails, which showed he knew about both of those things years before they became public.  As Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois told Judge Kavanaugh on Thursday, You say that words matter. You claim to be a textualist when you interpret other peoples words, but you dont want to be held accountable for the plain meaning of your own words. Judge Kavanaugh was quick to provide lawyerly explanations for all of these discrepancies, but they paint a pattern thats hard to ignore: He misstates facts under oath, and Republicans cover for him by making it hard, if not impossible, to get the documents proving it. With the help of the White House and a personal lawyer for Mr. Bush, Senator Chuck Grassley, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, has subverted a long-established, nonpartisan process and hidden more than 90 percent of the material pertaining to Judge Kavanaughs time in government.  Its only thanks to Senate Democrats and others that weve been able to see important pieces of the judges lengthy paper trail. There is far more that was never even requested. Far from being embarrassed by all this, Judge Kavanaugh is acting like someone who knows there is virtually nothing he can do to imperil his nomination. Instead, hes followed his own cynical advice to a 2002 judicial nominee: She should not talk about her views on specific policy or legal issues, he wrote in an email then. She should say that she has a commitment to follow Supreme Court precedent, that she understands and appreciates the role of a circuit judge, that she will adhere to statutory text, that she has no ideological agenda. That is more or less how Judge Kavanaugh got through his hearings. But his ideological agenda is well known, which is precisely why hes been on Republican Supreme Court shortlists for the last decade. That agenda includes, for starters, a well-established hostility to womens reproductive rights and a stunningly expansive view of presidential power and impunity. Republicans defend their steamrollering by saying that most Democrats have already made up their minds to oppose Judge Kavanaugh. Thats rich: In the months before the 2016 election, multiple high-ranking Republican senators openly vowed to block any and all Supreme Court picks by Hillary Clinton, period. Its also irrelevant. The people deserve to know everything possible about nominees to a lifetime seat on the highest court in the land, and they depend on their senators to seek out that information and share it.  The Constitution calls this process advice and consent. Until the last few years, Republicans claimed to take that responsibility seriously. Now they are making a mockery of what is meant to be a careful and deliberative process by playing three-card monte with the American people. They did the same with last years tax bill, rushing it through in the dead of night with virtually no debate or review.  The Republicans engage in this sort of subterfuge for an obvious reason: While they hold unified power in Washington, most of their agenda is hugely unpopular. So they hide as much of it as possible out of a fear that if more of it came to light, they will pay at the polls. Come November, voters can make that fear come true.

 Senators on the Judiciary Committee pressed Judge Brett Kavanaugh about the constitutional right to abortion and his views on the special counsel.  The third day of confirmation hearings for the Supreme Court nominee Brett M. Kavanaugh, and the second day of senators questioning, began at 9:30 a.m. and stretched late into the night.  The release of documents once marked committee confidential fortified Democratic questions on abortion, affirmative action and whether Judge Kavanaugh knew of Republican aides theft of Democratic computer files.  Many of those confidential documents spilled out in an anonymous release to The New York Times. Judge Kavanaughs abortion views created a stir outside the hearing room. Adding to the concerns of abortion rights advocates was a Kavanaugh reference to contraceptives as abortion-inducing drugs. He was answering a question from Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, about his dissent in a case involving Priests for Life, a religious organization that objected to a regulation under the Affordable Care Act requiring many employers to provide free insurance coverage for contraception to their female workers. Advertisement The group had objected to an accommodation offered by the Obama administration that allowed it to obtain a waiver by completing a form. Advertisement They said filling out the form would make them complicit in the provision of the abortion inducing drugs that they were as a religious matter objecting to, Judge Kavanaugh testified. Some religious organizations regard any form of birth control as an abortifacient. But Judge Kavanaughs use of the term abortion-inducing drugs set off alarm bells among abortion rights advocates and spawned a hashtag, #abortioninducingdrugs, on Twitter. Erica Sackin, director of political communications for Planned Parenthood of America, commented on Twitter: 
            BIG FLAG: #Kavanaugh just called birth control ""abortion-inducing drugs""         Judge Kavanaugh would not say whether he thought the Supreme Courts 2015 decision establishing a constitutional right to same-sex marriage had been correctly decided. But he tried to convey sympathy for gay rights by quoting from a Supreme Court decision in June that sided with a Colorado baker who refused to create a wedding cake for a same-sex couple. The ruling did not address the central dispute in the case and turned instead on apparent hostility against religion in a state civil rights commission. Judge Kavanaugh focused on one statement in the majority opinion, written by Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, the member of the court he hopes to replace. Our society has come to the recognition that gay persons and gay couples cannot be treated as social outcasts or as inferior in dignity and worth, Justice Kennedy wrote. Judge Kavanaugh noted that Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justices Samuel A. Alito Jr. and Neil M. Gorsuch, all members of the courts conservative wing, had joined the opinion. And he suggested that he agreed with the sentiment, too. Amid the arcane discussions of Supreme Court precedent and judicial philosophy, the Kavanaugh hearings did have some lighter moments. Advertisement Senator John Kennedy, Republican of Louisiana, had some probing questions about Judge Kavanaughs past: Did you ever get in trouble? Were you more of a John Boy Walton type or a Ferris Bueller type? The judge didnt bite. Mr. Cruz asked Judge Kavanaugh if he intends to play basketball at the court inside the Supreme Court building. No sitting justice has played there, Mr. Cruz said, since Justice Clarence Thomas, many years ago, when he was a much younger justice. Judge Kavanaugh said that if confirmed, he does indeed intend to play, on what is known as the highest court in the land. And speaking of basketball, Judge Kavanaugh is exceedingly proud of the girls basketball teams he has coached through the Catholic Youth Organization at his home parish, Blessed Sacrament in Chevy Chase, Md. About a dozen current and former players  in blue sweaters, ponytails and plaid skirts  showed up to watch. They sat in the front rows, right behind their coach. Judge Kavanaugh introduced each of them, rattling off their names and, in a remarkable display of memory not devoted to legal precedent, their grades. Lets see, he said. Weve got Liza going into fifth grade. Keegans in fifth. Annas in seventh. Shawnee is in seventh. Quinn is in sixth. Sophie is in seventh. So I think I got it all right. The room broke out into applause. In documents obtained by The New York Times that date back to Judge Kavanaughs time in the George W. Bush administration, Mr. Kavanaugh, then a White House aide, seemed to raise doubts about whether Roe v. Wade, the landmark Supreme Court ruling that found a constitutional right to an abortion, was settled law. He was considering a draft opinion piece to be run under the names of anti-abortion women that stated, it is widely accepted by legal scholars across the board that Roe v. Wade and its progeny are the settled law of the land. Responding to the email, the future Supreme Court nominee wrote, I am not sure that all legal scholars refer to Roe as the settled law of the land at the Supreme Court level since Court can always overrule its precedent, and three current Justices on the Court would do so. Advertisement The documents do not indicate how Judge Kavanaugh would rule, but they are fodder for Democratic questioning. Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, asked Mr. Kavanaugh about the document, noting it had been made public. Mr. Kavanaugh defended the statement he made in the email, and said the broader point was simply that it was overstating something about legal scholars. Im always concerned about accuracy, and I thought it was not an accurate description of all legal scholars, he said, adding later that Roe v. Wade is an important precedent. It has been reaffirmed many times. He declined to comment directly on Ms. Feinsteins questions as to whether it is correct law. NARAL Pro-Choice America, the abortion rights lobby, jumped on the release immediately: Brett Kavanaughs emails are rock solid evidence that he has been hiding his true beliefs and if he is given a lifetime seat on the Supreme Court, he will gut Roe v. Wade, criminalize abortion, and punish women. Everything he said yesterday in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee about settled law was nothing but a show to mislead the Senate. [Read more about the documents, here.] A tantalizing moment on Wednesday came when Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, asked Judge Kavanaugh whether he had meetings with Manuel Miranda, a former Senate Republican aide who was caught stealing files from the computers of Senate Judiciary Committee Democrats, including Mr. Leahy. Judge Kavanaugh denied ever knowingly receiving stolen material when he was a White House aide tasked with getting President George W. Bushs judicial nominees confirmed. On Thursday, questioning Judge Kavanaugh a second time, Mr. Leahy described and put up on posters several emails about his interactions with Mr. Miranda, indicating that he had received permission from the committee chairman around 3 a.m. to disclose them. They included a March 2003 email from Mr. Miranda to Judge Kavanaugh that included several pages of Democratic talking points, marked not for distribution, and another to Judge Kavanaugh from a Republican Senate staff member whose subject line spying and which referred to a mole for us on the left. 
            Subject: spying pic.twitter.com/GuIGHCjwiE  Judge Kavanaugh reiterated that he had no knowledge that Mr. Miranda had infiltrated Democratic files, saying he likely assumed that the Republican staff was getting information from friends who were Democratic staff members and nothing had raised red flags at the time. Advertisement I was born at night but not last night, Mr. Leahy said. If I had something that somebody said, we have stolen this or dont tell anybody we have this, I think it would raise some red flags. Mr. Leahy also pressed him about more than 100,000 documents from his period as a Bush White House lawyer that the Senate has not been permitted to see, even on a confidential basis, because a lawyer for President Bush has said they are subject to executive privilege. Mr. Leahy asked whether Judge Kavanaugh could confirm that none of those contain more such emails from Mr. Miranda.  Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter. You must select a newsletter to subscribe to. View all New York Times newsletters. Senator, I am not involved in the documents process, Judge Kavanaugh. I dont know whats in them. Replied Mr. Leahy: That is convenient. Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, pressed Mr. Kavanaugh on comments he made in support of Justice Antonin Scalias dissent in a case that upheld the constitutionality of an independent counsel. Given your views on Morrison v. Olson, we are obviously worried you will feel bound by this dissent by Scalia if President Trump decides to attempt to fire the special counsel Bob Mueller, Mr. Durbin said. Mr. Kavanaugh began by pushing back on the framing of Mr. Durbins question, noting that case involved the creation of an independent counsel, not a special counsel. But ultimately, he assured the senator, Ive made clear in my writing that when a court order requires a president to do something or prohibits a president from doing something under the constitution or laws of the United States, that is the final word. When it comes to the scope of executive power, he said, I am one not afraid at all in my record of twelve years to invalidate executive power when it violates the law. Later, under questioning from Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware, Judge Kavanaugh pushed back against what he called a misinterpretation of a comment he made at a 1999 round table, when he said, Maybe Nixon was wrongly decided  heresy though it is to say so. He was referring to the 1974 case of United States v. Nixon, where the Supreme Courts ruled unanimously that a sitting president, Richard M. Nixon, could be subpoenaed for documents and records like the Watergate tape recordings. Judge Kavanaugh said he was being wry, and critiquing the strategy of lawyers for President Bill Clinton during the investigation of that president. The tone of voice there has made the printed word look much different than how it was intended, he said, adding that he believes the case was correctly decided, and is one of the four greatest decisions in Supreme Court history. (He did not say what the other three are.) Advertisement Much of the morning was given to what appeared to be real drama, the move by Senator Cory Booker, Democrat of New Jersey, to release committee confidential documents without Republican permission  and Republican threats to exact consequences. After all, such a release could result in Mr. Bookers expulsion from Senate. Bring it, the senator said. Senators Booker and Mazie K. Hirono, Democrat of Hawaii, went ahead and released the documents. This is about the closest Ill ever come in my life to an I am Spartacus moment, Mr. Booker declared. But after the drama subsided, Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said all of those documents were cleared for release overnight. William A. Burck, the former Bush White House lawyer tasked with reviewing the Kavanaugh documents, said in a statement, We cleared the documents last night shortly after Senator Bookers staff asked us to. We were surprised to learn about Senator Bookers histrionics this morning because we had already told him he could use the documents publicly. In fact, we have said yes to every request made by the Senate Democrats to make documents public. The question remains, so why were Republicans handing Mr. Booker his moment, not saying, hey, whats the big deal? As for Mr. Booker, his spokeswoman gave him credit for forcing the documents release  and said this would not be the last of the document kerfuffles. Cory and Senate Democrats were able to shame the committee into agreeing to make last nights documents publicly available, and Cory publicly released those documents as well as other committee confidential documents today, the spokeswoman, Kristin Lynch, said in a statement. And hell keep releasing them because Republicans are hiding Brett Kavanaughs record from the American people. Advertisement Late in Wednesdays proceedings, the questioning finally reached Senator Kamala Harris, Democrat of California, and she launched into tense questioning that centered around whether Judge Kavanaugh had ever discussed the Russia investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, with a lawyer or lawyers from the law firm of President Trumps longtime personal lawyer, Marc Kasowitz. 
            Has Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh had a conversation about Robert Mueller or his investigation with anyone at Trump's personal attorney's law firm?We dont know. He refused to answer my question. pic.twitter.com/PAKxDGvEtZ  Judge Kavanaugh appeared somewhat baffled, but he would not offer a blanket no because he said he didnt know the names of every lawyer who worked for the firm, and he had discussed the Mueller investigation with lawyers and judges. I think youre thinking of someone, and you dont want to tell us, Ms. Harris said without elaboration. Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, gave Judge Kavanaugh an opportunity on Thursday to revisit Ms. Harriss line of questioning. Mr. Kavanaugh responded by acknowledging he doesnt know everyone who works at the firm, but said, I dont recall any conversations of that kind. I havent had any inappropriate conversations about that investigation with anyone, Judge Kavanaugh said. Ive never given anyone any winks, hints, forecasts, previews, nothing, about my view as a judge, or how I would rule as a judge on that or anything related to that. A spokesman for Kasowitz Benson Torres said in a statement Thursday that there have been no discussions regarding Robert Muellers investigation between Judge Kavanaugh and anyone at our firm. In a letter last June to Mr. Mueller, Mr. Kasowitz cited a majority opinion by Judge Kavanaugh, without naming him, saying, The President may decline to prosecute certain violators of federal law just as the President may pardon certain violators of federal law. The President may decline to prosecute or may pardon because of the Presidents own constitutional concerns about a law or because of policy objections to the law, among other reasons. The question is, can and will the senator tell the public what she knows? Most Supreme Court nominees express enthusiasm for cameras in the court at their confirmation hearings, only to change their minds after they join the court. Judge Kavanaugh took a different approach, saying only that I will have an open mind on it. Advertisement He said his current court, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, has recently allowed live audio coverage of its arguments. That development, he said, was a positive one. But he offered only vague comments on electronic coverage of the Supreme Court. The court generally releases audio recording of arguments at the end of the week and does not allow camera coverage. Judge Kavanaugh made one novel suggestion, offering that the court should consider camera coverage of the sessions in which the justices summarize their opinions from the bench. The court, which currently releases audio of those sessions months later, is unlikely to adopt the idea. The justices may be wary of suggesting to the public that their informal oral summaries, rather than their written opinions, precisely set out the details of decisions.

By Katherine Stewart Ms. Stewart is the author of The Good News Club: The Christian Rights Stealth Assault on Americas Children. On day two of the confirmation hearings for Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh, President Trumps second nominee to the Supreme Court, Senator John Cornyn of Texas brought up the 2000 case Santa Fe Independent School District v. Doe, in which the court ruled that sectarian prayers at high school football games violated the clause of the First Amendment that prohibits the establishment of religion. Mr. Cornyn repeated Chief Justice William H. Rehnquists complaint that the decision bristle[d] with hostility to all things religious in public life. In fact, the plaintiffs in the case identified as Catholic and Mormon, and it is safe to say that they were not hostile to religion, but to the presumption that one religion speaks for all. Judge Kavanaugh, eager to signal his agreement with Mr. Cornyn, tossed back the catch phrase that Mr. Cornyn appeared to be fishing for: religious liberty. Over the course of this weeks Senate confirmation hearings, the other senator from Texas, Ted Cruz, repeatedly identified Judge Kavanaugh as a jurist who would uphold religious liberty. That should concern anyone who cares about actual freedom, religious and otherwise. What senators Cornyn, Cruz and other religious conservatives mean by religious liberty is its opposite. If the Senate confirms Brett Kavanaugh, it will be declaring that the United States is a nation in which one brand of religion enjoys a place of privilege; that we are a nation of laws  except in cases where the law offends those who subscribe to our preferred religion; and that we recognize the dignity of all people unless they belong to specific groups our national religion views with disapproval. When a pharmacist refuses to fill a prescription on the basis of his own religious beliefs, according to todays Christian nationalists, that is a shining example of religious liberty. It is not. When a Catholic hospital delays or refuses to perform a legal and medically indicated procedure on a woman suffering a miscarriage on the grounds that the procedure violates its religious directives, that isnt religious liberty. When a private school that miseducates students with scientifically illiterate and historically inaccurate theories claims a public subsidy, or a Medicare-supported retirement home turns away a lesbian couple, that isnt religious liberty, either. Lets call it by its true name: religious privilege, not religious liberty. Todays Christian nationalists want the ability to override the law where it conflicts with their religious beliefs, and thus to withdraw from the social contract that binds the rest of us together as a nation. This kind of religious privilege has a history. In the Jim Crow south, for example, when black doctors and black patients were routinely shunted to inferior hospitals, many people justified the practice in terms of their sincerely held biblical belief that God intended for the races to be forever separated. Religious privilege of this sort was never intended for all belief systems, but rather for one type of religion. Sure, its advocates will on occasion rope in representatives of non-Christian faiths to lend the illusion of principle to their cause. But the real aim and effect of the religious liberty movement is to advance their idea of religion at the expense of everyone else. If your religion or deeply held moral beliefs include the view that all people should be treated with equal dignity, then this religious liberty wont do anything for you. If youre a taxpayer who helps to fund your local hospital, a patient who keeps it in business, or a professional who works there, then your sincerely held religious and moral conviction that all people are entitled to equal access to the best medicine that science can provide and the law permits wont stand a chance against a Catholic bishops conviction that some procedures are forbidden by a higher authority. Todays Christian nationalists will insist they are the only victims here. But that is as false as it is lacking in compassion. The terribly real effect of the kind of religious supremacy they seek is to target specific groups of people as legitimate objects of contempt. L.G.B.T. Americans, women and members of non-favored religions may be able to get the services they need from some other pharmacist or cake decorator or retirement home or emergency room  at least we have to hope so. But what they wont get back is the equal dignity to which they are entitled  and thats the point. President Trump, as part of his kickback to the white evangelicals who got him elected, has fashioned this idea of religious supremacy into a cornerstone of his shambolic administration. In January 2018, the Department of Health and Human Services set up an office designed to make it easier for health care professionals to deprive their clients of medical services, including birth control and other forms of reproductive care, on the basis of religious belief. In July, Attorney General Jeff Sessions followed up with his own Religious Liberty Task Force. Already the Department of Labor is assuring federal contractors that its all right to violate anti-discrimination law as long as they can claim they did it on account of an implicitly defined set of religious or deeply held moral beliefs. All of these detestable initiatives, however, are really just a preview of the damage Brett Kavanaugh would be able to deliver from the Supreme Court. To understand the significance of Judge Kavanaughs nomination, you have to know something about how he got to this crowning point in his career. Judge Kavanaugh comes from a hothouse carefully tended by the ideologues of the Federalist Society and given the stamp of approval by Mr. Trumps court evangelicals and conservative Catholics. Having lost the so-called culture war on womens and L.G.B.T. rights among the general public, Christian nationalists understand that the only way for their regressive views to dominate is if they control the courts. The confirmation process brought to you by todays Republican Party only serves to confirm the antidemocratic nature of Judge Kavanaughs appointment. Republicans defaulted on their Constitutional obligation to advise and consent on the nomination of Judge Merrick Garland. But now they are aiming to push Judge Kavanaughs through without anything close to a full revelation of his documentary trail. The part of the trail that is visible confirms that Judge Kavanaughs theoconservative backers have chosen a candidate who will advance their agenda. There was a time when Thomas Jeffersons wall of separation between church and state was part of the furniture of American constitutional thought. Only a grumbling minority talked about tearing it down. But in a recent speech, Judge Kavanaugh seized on a dissenting opinion in which his judicial hero, Justice Rehnquist, argued that the wall metaphor was based on bad history and useless as a guide to judging. In his dissenting opinion in Priests for Life v. Health and Human Services, Judge Kavanaugh argued that requiring an organization to fill out a one-page form that would have exempted it from providing contraception coverage imposed a substantial burden on its free exercise of religion. He appears to feel keenly the anguish of priests and nuns living in a nation where women have a range of lawfully and medically supported health care options. But in Garza v. Hargan, he thought it was no real burden for a minor, pregnant and in federal custody, to be denied access to the abortion she desperately wanted in order for the government to search for a sponsor, rather than arrange for her medical treatment directly. In that same decision  thankfully slapped down by the full bench of the court on which he sat  Judge Kavanaugh characterized abortion as a momentous life decision and referred contemptuously to abortion rights as abortion on demand. That is precisely how religious liberty works today. You maximize the moral anguish of those whose religion and values you favor and minimize the rights and suffering of those you disfavor. Judge Kavanaughs performance in his confirmation hearings served only to amplify these concerns. In answer to Mr. Cruzs invitation to discuss religious liberty, Judge Kavanaugh spoke movingly about the suffering of those who were prevented from bringing their religion into the public square. But he had next to nothing to say about the benefits that have flowed to all of us from the many landmark decisions that have prevented religious groups from using the power of the state to impose their views. He endorsed the appeal to history and tradition in justifying the mixing of religion and government functions, but showed no awareness that such appeals invariably confer privilege on those religions best able to claim this history for themselves. He celebrated recent rulings that establish the right of religious groups to participate in public programs, but failed to note that the concerns those rulings raise have to do with the use of taxpayer funds by religious groups whose beliefs are not universally shared  and whose discriminatory practices are at odds with laws that apply to the rest of the nonprofit (and for-profit) world. In response to Mr. Cornyn, Judge Kavanaugh gave favorable mention to the Supreme Court decision in the Good News Club v. Milford Central School case. At one time, public elementary schools largely excluded these clubs in response to Establishment Clause concerns. The Good News decision required the schools to open their doors to evangelical clubs, which gives young children the false but unavoidable impression that their school endorses one religion above all others. For Judge Kavanaugh, who wrote an amicus brief in the case while in private practice, this was a victory for religious liberty, presumably available to all other religions. But in the real world, few other religious groups have thought it appropriate to emulate the Good News Clubs strategy in going after other peoples elementary-age children in their public schools. And those who have tested identical strategies  the Satanic Temple tried it in 2016  have effectively had the school doors slammed in their faces. Judge Kavanaughs disdain for the separation of church and state will matter in decisions that go well beyond the usual battlegrounds in the culture war. He has expressed enthusiastic support for school voucher programs, for example, which are ways of pretending to reform education while funneling money from the public purse to religious organizations. Judge Kavanaughs record shows he also has a special place in his heart for the mystical belief systems of corporations. He endorsed the Hobby Lobby decision, which allowed that corporation to use its religious beliefs to deny birth control coverage to its employees. There is another vision of America, one where we come together as a people to solve as many of the problems that we face as we can. In an America that must still exist somewhere in our collective imagination, no group of individuals is singled out to be stripped of their dignity. In this America, we treat everybody equally under the law and we expect everyone to follow it. Citizens are free to exercise their religion, but not to impose it on other people or to fund it at public expense. The choice before the Senate is whether we continue to advance this vision of an open and tolerant America or stamp this low moment in our political history on the highest court of the land.

Protests continued intermittently.  For more analysis of the day, read here. Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, raised two Bush-era scandals with Judge Kavanaugh, and he suggested that Bush White House emails in the Judiciary Committees possession may contradict testimony the nominee made more than a decade ago  if only they could be released publicly. The exchange was tantalizing but incomplete. One of the scandals was the disclosure in late 2003 and 2004 that a Republican Judiciary Committee staff member had infiltrated the Democrats confidential internal files about which of President George W. Bushs judicial nominees to try to block and with what tactics. The other was the disclosure that after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, the Bush administration had secretly ordered the National Security Agency to intercept Americans phone calls and emails without obtaining the judicial warrants seemingly required by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Advertisement At his appeals court confirmation hearing in 2006, Judge Kavanaugh  who had worked as an associate White House counsel in the Bush administration  told senators that he did not know anything about the infiltration of Senate Democrats files on judicial nomination fights or about the warrantless wiretapping program before they eventually became public. Advertisement But Mr. Leahy indicated that documents marked committee confidential show that Manuel Miranda, then a Republican staffer on the Judiciary Committee, had sent Judge Kavanaugh emails about Mr. Leahys private concerns about a judicial nominee whose hearing was coming up and a draft letter Mr. Leahy had not yet sent. He also suggested that the files may show that Mr. Miranda made a reference to having a mole on the committee or spying on Democrats, and that Mr. Miranda may have suggested meeting outside of their workplaces. The senator also indicated that Mr. Kavanaugh may have had some involvement with a memo written by John Yoo, who was an attorney in the Justice Departments Office of Legal Counsel who wrote opinions secretly blessing the surveillance program as lawful. Judge Kavanaugh insisted that everything he had testified before was 100 percent accurate, but indicated that he was not sure what Mr. Leahy was referring to. Mr. Leahy asked Mr. Grassley to lift the confidentiality protections over the emails in question so he and Judge Kavanaugh could discuss them in his second round of questioning, and Mr. Grassley indicated he would look at them. I am concerned because there is evidence that Mr. Miranda provided you with materials that were stolen from me, Mr. Leahy said. And that would contradict your prior testimony. It is also clear from public emails  and Im refraining from going into nonpublic ones  that you had reason to believe materials were obtained inappropriately at the time. Judge Kavanaugh, under attack from progressives and Democrats who say he will roll back abortion rights, asserted that he understood the significance of the issue and would respect the Supreme Courts precedent on precedent. I dont live in a bubble. I understand I live in the real world, he said, after Ms. Feinstein reminded him of the death tolls in this country among women who tried to end their own pregnancies before Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 decision establishing a constitutional right to abortion. I understand your point of view on that and I understand how passionate and how deeply people feel about this issue, he said. Senator Feinstein did not ask him the operative question  Does he believe Roe was correctly decided?  but even if she had, he had already told Senator Grassley it would not be appropriate to answer it. She did ask him what he meant when he told Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, that he believed Roe was settled law. At that, he launched into a discourse on the value of precedent. Advertisement Judge Kavanaugh said that Roe was settled as a precedent of the Supreme Court, and as such, deserves respect from judges who took note of it. But then he noted a subsequent case, the 1992 case of Planned Parenthood v. Casey, which narrowed the scope of Roe, at the same time that it reaffirmed Roe as a precedent. Casey, which gave states the authority to regulate abortion so long as those regulations do not pose an undue burden on the woman, is precedent on precedent, he said. His comments were a reminder that, as Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader, has often pointed out, precedents are only settled law until the Supreme Court unsettles them. Democrats complain that previous nominees have pledged to respect precedents, only to narrow or overturn them once seated on the court. One opinion of intense interest to Democrats is Judge Kavanaughs dissent in the 2017 case Garza v. Hargan, which involved a pregnant, 17-year-old undocumented immigrant whom the Trump administration tried to block from having an immediate abortion. Judge Kavanaugh sided with the administration in arguing that the teen should have been transferred to the care of an immigration sponsor  a family member or friend  before being allowed terminate her pregnancy. Under questioning from Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, he said he was only following Supreme Court precedent, though he conceded, There is no case on exact point. So, Judge Kavanaugh said, he rooted his dissent in Supreme Court cases that have permitted states to require pregnant teens to obtain the consent of their parents for an abortion. Mr. Durbin objected, suggesting that Texas, where the girl was housed in an immigration facility, had imposed no such requirement on her. You are adding a requirement here, the senator said. Im not adding. Im a judge. The policy has been made by others, Judge Kavanaugh replied. Im deciding whether the policy is consistent with Supreme Court precedent. I did my level best in an emergency posture, he added. Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, put that question directly to Judge Kavanaugh. Advertisement If Mr. Leahy thought he was going to get a direct answer to the direct question, he was mistaken. 
            Leahy: ""President Trump claims he has an absolute right to pardon himself. Does he?""Kavanaugh: ""The question of self-pardons is something I've never analyzed. It's a question I have not written about... It's a hypothetical question that I can't begin to answer in this context"" pic.twitter.com/N91BYOuqKV  The question of self pardons is something Ive never analyzed, Judge Kavanaugh said, adding: I cant begin to answer in this context as a sitting judge and a nominee to the Supreme Court. Mr. Leahy pressed anyway, asking whether the president could pardon associates to keep them from testifying against him. Again, Judge Kavanaugh dodged the question, saying that as a judge, he would normally receive briefs and arguments from both sides before coming to a conclusion. Im not going to answer hypothetical questions of that sort, he said. Pressed by Ms. Feinstein, Judge Kavanaugh refused to say whether he would rule that the Constitution permits a sitting president to be subpoenaed for testimony. He said that as a matter of judicial independence, he would not give the Senate a precise answer on a hypothetical that might come before me. 
            Sen. Feinstein: ""Can a sitting president be required to respond to a subpoena?"" Kavanaugh: ""As a matter of the canons of judicial independence, I can't give you an answer on that hypothetical question."" pic.twitter.com/cQhxUmxJH9  The potential for a legal fight over a presidential subpoena has become a hot topic amid speculation that Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel investigating Russias interference in the 2016 campaign, may issue a subpoena for President Trump. Lawyers for the president and the office of the special counsel have been negotiating for months over whether Mr. Trump will voluntarily sit for an interview, so far without success. In 1974, the Supreme Court unanimously ruled in United States v. Nixon that a sitting president  in that case Richard M. Nixon  could be subpoenaed for documents and records like the Watergate tape recordings. But the court has never addressed the question of whether a sitting president could be forced to answer questions, which raises additional issues about the time it would take to prepare and the potential distraction from carrying out his constitutional duties. Noting that Chief Justice Warren Burger, who wrote the ruling, had been appointed by President Nixon, Judge Kavanaugh said he thought the Watergate tapes ruling was one of the greatest moments in the Supreme Courts history because it stood up for judicial independence in the face of political pressure, but how that precedent would apply to other hypotheticals  like whether a subpoena for presidential testimony in a criminal investigation should also be upheld  was something he should not address, citing the practice of previous Supreme Court nominees. Judge Kavanaugh was a prosecutor working for Ken Starr when the independent counsel issued a subpoena to Mr. Clinton. But Mr. Clintons legal team negotiated a deal whereby he testified voluntarily before a grand jury, and Mr. Starr withdrew the subpoena, so the issue was never adjudicated. Years later, after working in the Bush administration after the Sept. 11 attacks, Judge Kavanaugh said that he thought presidents should be temporarily shielded from criminal investigation while they were in office, although he left it ambiguous as to whether he thought that was a change Congress should make or that the Constitution might already allow. Answering the very first question on Wednesday, from Senator Grassley, the Judiciary Committee chairman, Judge Kavanaugh said he would be an independent justice. He cited three Supreme Court landmarks to make his case. Advertisement Two were predictable: Brown v. Board of Education, the 1954 decision that ruled segregated public schools unconstitutional, and Youngstown Sheet and Tube Company v. Sawyer, the 1952 decision rejecting President Harry S. Trumans attempt to seize the nations steel mills to aid the war effort in Korea. The third was notable: United States v. Nixon, the 1974 decision in which Supreme Court unanimously ruled that President Nixon had to comply with a subpoena seeking tapes of his conversations in the Oval Office. Will a Supreme Court with two Trump-appointed justices overrule the right to an abortion? Its possible, but not the most likely outcome. Adam Liptak, The Timess Supreme Court reporter, explains. Judge Kavanaugh has not always been unequivocal in his support for the decision. In a 1999 transcript of a round-table discussion, he said, Maybe Nixon was wrongly decided  heresy though it is to say so. His allies have said he meant the statement as a critique of the legal strategy of President Bill Clintons lawyers. On Wednesday, Judge Kavanaughs said the message of the decision, which he called one of the greatest moments in American judicial history, was clear. No one is above the law in our constitutional system, he said. An abstract but important part of Judge Kavanaughs judicial philosophy is his skeptical approach to so-called Chevron deference, the principle that when a statute granting a regulatory agency the authority to make rules about a certain topic  such as protections for the environment, consumers, or workers  are ambiguous, the courts should accept the agencys interpretation that it has the power to make a rule.  Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter. You must select a newsletter to subscribe to. View all New York Times newsletters. Corporations opposed to what they see as overly burdensome regulations want the Supreme Court to overturn or narrow the Chevron ruling, making it harder for executive agencies to expand into new areas. Questioned about his view of the powers of administrative agencies by Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, Judge Kavanaugh touted several rulings in which he had upheld environmental regulations rather than striking them down, but he gave little sign of support for Chevron deference, insisting instead that executive branch agencies must not be permitted to rewrite laws passed by Congress to expand its authority. Ive heard it said that Im a skeptic of regulation, he said. Im not a skeptic of regulation at all. Im a skeptic of unauthorized regulation, of illegal regulation, of regulation that is outside the bounds of what the laws passed by Congress have said. Back in 2006, Judge Kavanaugh testified during his appeals court confirmation that he was not involved in the questions about the rules governing detention of combatants while working in a George W. Bush White House that was wrestling with the handling of terrorism suspects. Advertisement Instead, he said, his portfolio focused on civil justice issues like terrorism insurance. Mr. Durbin was having none of it. It has since emerged that Judge Kavanaugh was involved in a Bush White House discussion about whether American citizens being held as enemy combatants should get access to lawyers, the senator said, and that the nominee had volunteered to prepare a Justice Department official for testimony about monitoring attorney-client conversations of terrorism-related federal inmates. He also said Judge Kavanaugh had privately admitted involvement in a December 2005 signing statement by President Bush that asserted a right to bypass a newly tightened torture ban. You went further than you should have, Mr. Durbin said. In the three specific instances I gave you, you clearly were involved in questions about rules governing detention of combatants. But Judge Kavanaugh defended his testimony as accurate. Among other things, he said his statement that he was not involved  which came in response to a question 12 years ago from Mr. Durbin  was a reference to the Bush administrations so-called enhanced interrogation program, not terrorism prisoners generally. I was not read into that program, he said. I told the truth about that. He also said that while, as White House staff secretary in December 2005, he passed the torture ban signing statement onto Mr. Bush for his signature, it was the White House counsel  Harriet Miers  who controlled the text of that document. I cant recall what I said about the torture ban signing statement, Judge Kavanaugh said. I do recall that there was a good deal of internal debate about that signing statement, as you can imagine there would be. I remember that it was controversial internally. The second day of Judge Kavanaughs hearings started with still more protests  just as Senator Grassley opened with a hope that the proceedings would be under more control than Tuesdays divisive opening. One woman was led out shouting sham president, sham justice. In his opening remarks, Mr. Grassley accused Democrats  who strategized for the hearing on a conference call Monday  of colluding with protesters to disrupt the hearing. NBC News reported that Democratic members of the committee plotted with minority leaders to disrupt the hearing yesterday, he said. Democratic senators interrupted the hearing 63 times before lunch, and in the audience, 70 people were arrested yesterday who were following their lead. But one of the protesters took exception to Mr. Grassleys assertion, since, she said, she was calling out Democratic leaders such as Mr. Durbin for their tepid efforts to thwart the nominee. And a spokesman for Mr. Schumer said there was no coordination. Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh, President Trumps nominee to the Supreme Court, appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee for the first day of his confirmation hearing. In the 1990s, as a prosecutor in Mr. Starrs Monica Lewinsky investigation, Judge Kavanaugh supported aggressive questioning of former President Bill Clinton about his sexual relations with the former White House intern. Advertisement Years later, however, Mr. Kavanaugh expressed regret about that view, suggesting that sitting presidents should not be subjected to the kind of distracting investigations that helped subject Mr. Clinton to as part of the Starr investigation. That shift in views has prompted Democrats to assert that Mr. Kavanaugh would try to protect Mr. Trump from Mr. Muellers Russia investigation. Ms. Feinstein pressed Judge Kavanaugh on that point on Wednesday. Mr. Kavanaugh said his views changed after he watched former President George W. Bush deal with the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and their aftermath, and concluded that presidents should not be distracted from important crises like that by having to respond to investigations such as the one that Mr. Clinton faced. September 11  thats what changed, he told Ms. Feinstein. He added, however, that his comments about potential changes to the statutes governing investigations of presidents do not reflect his thinking on the question of whether the Constitution would allow such investigations to proceed. If a case came up where someone was trying to say this was a constitutional principle, I would have a completely open mind on that, he said. Critics of Judge Kavanaugh have noted that he clerked for a former 9th Circuit Court of Appeals judge, Alex Kozinski, who has been accused of sexually harassing more than a dozen women. They assert that Mr. Kavanaugh must have known about the allegations long before they were made public. Advertisement Senator Hatch came to Judge Kavanaughs defense, calling such accusations against Mr. Kavanaugh guilt by association, but asked a series of gentle questions designed to give the judge an opportunity to deny them. He did just that, seeking to put distance between himself and any hint that he knew of or condoned the judges behavior. Did you know anything about these allegations against Judge Kozinski? Mr. Hatch asked. Nothing, Mr. Kavanaugh responded, adding a moment later: When they became public, the first thought I had was no woman should be subjected to harassment in the workplace, including in the judiciary, especially in the judiciary. He went on: It was a gut punch for me. It was a gut punch for the judiciary. I was shocked, disappointed, angry  swirl of emotions. Ove rall, Judge Kavanaugh has gone out of his way to extol his record on women. He said he has made an aggressive effort to hire female clerks. Twenty-five of the 48 clerks that Judge Kavanaugh has hired during his 12 years on the appeals court have been women, and 21 have gone on to clerk at the Supreme Court, he told the committee. He said he was spurred to do so by an article in The New York Times by Linda Greenhouse, the newspapers former Supreme Court correspondent, who wrote in 2006, the same year Judge Kavanaugh joined the court, about the paucity of female clerks on the Supreme Court. Judge Kavanaugh said that troubled him, calling it unacceptable. He hired three women (out of four clerks) for his first year on the bench, adding that the next generation of leaders and Supreme Court justices will be drawn from the ranks of that generation. Its something Im very focused on at all times, he said. Judge Kavanaugh held up his ruling in a 2012 appeals court case reversing the military commissions conviction of a former Guantnamo detainee, Salim Hamdan, as evidence that he would be independent and could resist public and political pressure when it came to deciding cases. Mr. Hamdan, a Yemeni man who served as a driver and bodyguard to the Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden had been convicted in 2008 before a military commission on a charge of providing material support for terrorism. His lawyers challenged the conviction on the grounds that material support was not a recognized international war crime at the time of his actions, and tribunals are generally for war crimes. The Military Commissions Act of 2006 listed that charge as a war crime that the tribunals could handle, but Judge Kavanaugh and the appeals court ruled that it did not apply retroactively and overturned the conviction. You will never have a nominee who has ruled for a more unpopular defendant than ruling for Salim Hamdan, Judge Kavanaugh said. And why did I do that in that case? Why did I rule for someone who had been involved in the September 11th? Its because the law compelled it. Still, Mr. Hamdan, who had already served his sentence and been repatriated back to Yemen by 2012, was not accused of advance knowledge of or involvement in the September 11 attacks. And in many other important cases involving Guantnamo detainees, Judge Kavanaugh sided with the government  including ruling in ways that made it harder for detainees to win habeas corpus lawsuits challenging the basis for their indefinite wartime detention without trial; arguing that the appeals court had no jurisdiction to hear challenges brought by military commissions defendants before the tribunal issued a final judgment; and maintaining that international law cannot be enforced in court as a constraint against what Congress and the president do with tribunals.

Kavanaughs views on abortion took center stage in the Senate on Tuesday after he assured a key Republican senator that he believed the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision was settled law  a comment that Democrats and abortion rights advocates derided as a meaningless dodge. Emerging from a more than two-hour courtesy visit with Judge Kavanaugh, President Trumps Supreme Court nominee, Senator Susan Collins of Maine said they had discussed abortion cases at length, and that he told her he agreed with Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., who told senators during his 2005 confirmation hearings that he regarded Roe as settled law. Ms. Collins later said she was heartened by the statement. Ms. Collins and Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska are two Republican backers of abortion rights, and both say they are undecided on Judge Kavanaugh. Their votes are critical to his confirmation. The term settled law refers to a precedent that is entitled to respect, and does not necessarily indicate that precedent cannot be limited or overturned. Ms. Collinss statement on the matter may say less about Judge Kavanaughs views on abortion than her ultimate vote, which appears to be leaning toward yes. She had already called him a clearly qualified nominee. The judges confirmation hearings are set to begin on Sept. 4, with a confirmation vote possible before the end of next month. Democrats immediately pounced on the settled law construction, saying it is a standard phrase employed to duck the real question: whether Roe was correctly decided. Lets be clear; this is not as simple as Judge Kavanaugh saying that Roe is settled law, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, told reporters. Everything the Supreme Court decides is settled law until it unsettles it. Saying a case is settled law is not the same thing as saying a case was correctly decided. Mr. Schumer, who has said he will oppose Judge Kavanaughs confirmation, also met with him on Tuesday during an hour-and-a-half session that, by the senators account, was cordial but not particularly revealing. Mr. Schumer said he asked numerous questions  including whether Judge Kavanaugh believed Roe was correctly decided, whether he believed the Affordable Care Act was constitutional and whether a president should have to comply with a subpoena  and that the judge repeatedly refused to answer. Cant talk about a case that would come before me, cant talk about hypotheticals, a frustrated-sounding Mr. Schumer said, relaying Judge Kavanaughs words. I said, Well, then you cant talk about just about anything. Judge Kavanaughs views on abortion have raised intense concern among abortion rights advocates, in part because of a dissent he wrote in a 2017 case, Garza v. Hargan, that drew widespread attention last fall. Ms. Collins said she talked to Judge Kavanaugh at length about the Garza case  the only abortion case in which he has rendered a decision. In that decision, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, on which Judge Kavanaugh serves, voted to allow an undocumented 17-year-old in immigration detention to seek an abortion without delay; the Trump administration had wanted to first transfer her to an adult sponsor for guidance. In his dissent, Judge Kavanaugh wrote that while the appeals court was bound to obey Supreme Court rulings that said the Constitution protects a womans right to choose an abortion, those precedents nonetheless permit the government to apply reasonable regulations that do not impose an undue burden. Ms. Collins has previously said that she will vote against any nominee who demonstrates hostility to Roe. In her meeting with Judge Kavanaugh, Ms. Collins said, we talked at great length about precedent and the application of stare decisis  the legal principle of standing by precedent  to abortion cases. We talked about whether he considered Roe to be settled law; he said that he agreed with what Justice Roberts said at his nomination hearing, in which he said that it was settled law, she added. Chief Justice Roberts testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee in 2005 that Roe was settled as a precedent of the court, entitled to respect under principles of stare decisis. However, he added, those principles explain when cases should be revisited and when they should not. Abortion rights groups immediately jumped on the settled law comment, noting that, despite his confirmation hearing testimony, Chief Justice Roberts dissented when the Supreme Court struck down a Texas law that would have severely restricted access to abortion. Kavanaughs reference to Chief Justice Roberts as a standard-bearer on abortion is alarming, said Dawn Laguens, the executive vice president of Planned Parenthood Action Fund, the groups political arm. Beyond abortion, Ms. Collins said she and Judge Kavanaugh spoke about executive powers, his judicial philosophy and which judges he admires most. They also discussed gun rights, including the so-called Heller case, a highly publicized 2011 case involving a challenge to a District of Columbia law that required gun owners to register their weapons and banned possession of semiautomatic rifles. (The case was a follow-on to an earlier one, District of Columbia v. Heller, that resulted in a landmark Supreme Court ruling in 2008 that the Second Amendments right to bear arms applied to individuals, not simply to those in a well-regulated militia.) While the appeals court upheld those limits, Judge Kavanaugh dissented, arguing that while the government may ban fully automatic machine guns, a ban on semiautomatic rifles should be unconstitutional, because they have not traditionally been banned and are in common use by law-abiding citizens for self-defense in the home, hunting and other lawful uses. Calling the session very productive and very informative, Ms. Collins said she intended to wait until after Judge Kavanaughs confirmation hearings to decide whether to support him. You never know what questions are going to come up at a Judiciary Committee hearing where 21 individuals will be questioning him, she said.     Advertisement","Kavanaugh Agrees Roe v.

 Senators on the Judiciary Committee pressed Judge Brett Kavanaugh about the constitutional right to abortion and his views on the special counsel.  The third day of confirmation hearings for the Supreme Court nominee Brett M. Kavanaugh, and the second day of senators questioning, began at 9:30 a.m. and stretched late into the night.  The release of documents once marked committee confidential fortified Democratic questions on abortion, affirmative action and whether Judge Kavanaugh knew of Republican aides theft of Democratic computer files.  Many of those confidential documents spilled out in an anonymous release to The New York Times. Judge Kavanaughs abortion views created a stir outside the hearing room. Adding to the concerns of abortion rights advocates was a Kavanaugh reference to contraceptives as abortion-inducing drugs. He was answering a question from Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, about his dissent in a case involving Priests for Life, a religious organization that objected to a regulation under the Affordable Care Act requiring many employers to provide free insurance coverage for contraception to their female workers. Advertisement The group had objected to an accommodation offered by the Obama administration that allowed it to obtain a waiver by completing a form. Advertisement They said filling out the form would make them complicit in the provision of the abortion inducing drugs that they were as a religious matter objecting to, Judge Kavanaugh testified. Some religious organizations regard any form of birth control as an abortifacient. But Judge Kavanaughs use of the term abortion-inducing drugs set off alarm bells among abortion rights advocates and spawned a hashtag, #abortioninducingdrugs, on Twitter. Erica Sackin, director of political communications for Planned Parenthood of America, commented on Twitter: 
            BIG FLAG: #Kavanaugh just called birth control ""abortion-inducing drugs""         Judge Kavanaugh would not say whether he thought the Supreme Courts 2015 decision establishing a constitutional right to same-sex marriage had been correctly decided. But he tried to convey sympathy for gay rights by quoting from a Supreme Court decision in June that sided with a Colorado baker who refused to create a wedding cake for a same-sex couple. The ruling did not address the central dispute in the case and turned instead on apparent hostility against religion in a state civil rights commission. Judge Kavanaugh focused on one statement in the majority opinion, written by Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, the member of the court he hopes to replace. Our society has come to the recognition that gay persons and gay couples cannot be treated as social outcasts or as inferior in dignity and worth, Justice Kennedy wrote. Judge Kavanaugh noted that Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justices Samuel A. Alito Jr. and Neil M. Gorsuch, all members of the courts conservative wing, had joined the opinion. And he suggested that he agreed with the sentiment, too. Amid the arcane discussions of Supreme Court precedent and judicial philosophy, the Kavanaugh hearings did have some lighter moments. Advertisement Senator John Kennedy, Republican of Louisiana, had some probing questions about Judge Kavanaughs past: Did you ever get in trouble? Were you more of a John Boy Walton type or a Ferris Bueller type? The judge didnt bite. Mr. Cruz asked Judge Kavanaugh if he intends to play basketball at the court inside the Supreme Court building. No sitting justice has played there, Mr. Cruz said, since Justice Clarence Thomas, many years ago, when he was a much younger justice. Judge Kavanaugh said that if confirmed, he does indeed intend to play, on what is known as the highest court in the land. And speaking of basketball, Judge Kavanaugh is exceedingly proud of the girls basketball teams he has coached through the Catholic Youth Organization at his home parish, Blessed Sacrament in Chevy Chase, Md. About a dozen current and former players  in blue sweaters, ponytails and plaid skirts  showed up to watch. They sat in the front rows, right behind their coach. Judge Kavanaugh introduced each of them, rattling off their names and, in a remarkable display of memory not devoted to legal precedent, their grades. Lets see, he said. Weve got Liza going into fifth grade. Keegans in fifth. Annas in seventh. Shawnee is in seventh. Quinn is in sixth. Sophie is in seventh. So I think I got it all right. The room broke out into applause. In documents obtained by The New York Times that date back to Judge Kavanaughs time in the George W. Bush administration, Mr. Kavanaugh, then a White House aide, seemed to raise doubts about whether Roe v. Wade, the landmark Supreme Court ruling that found a constitutional right to an abortion, was settled law. He was considering a draft opinion piece to be run under the names of anti-abortion women that stated, it is widely accepted by legal scholars across the board that Roe v. Wade and its progeny are the settled law of the land. Responding to the email, the future Supreme Court nominee wrote, I am not sure that all legal scholars refer to Roe as the settled law of the land at the Supreme Court level since Court can always overrule its precedent, and three current Justices on the Court would do so. Advertisement The documents do not indicate how Judge Kavanaugh would rule, but they are fodder for Democratic questioning. Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, asked Mr. Kavanaugh about the document, noting it had been made public. Mr. Kavanaugh defended the statement he made in the email, and said the broader point was simply that it was overstating something about legal scholars. Im always concerned about accuracy, and I thought it was not an accurate description of all legal scholars, he said, adding later that Roe v. Wade is an important precedent. It has been reaffirmed many times. He declined to comment directly on Ms. Feinsteins questions as to whether it is correct law. NARAL Pro-Choice America, the abortion rights lobby, jumped on the release immediately: Brett Kavanaughs emails are rock solid evidence that he has been hiding his true beliefs and if he is given a lifetime seat on the Supreme Court, he will gut Roe v. Wade, criminalize abortion, and punish women. Everything he said yesterday in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee about settled law was nothing but a show to mislead the Senate. [Read more about the documents, here.] A tantalizing moment on Wednesday came when Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, asked Judge Kavanaugh whether he had meetings with Manuel Miranda, a former Senate Republican aide who was caught stealing files from the computers of Senate Judiciary Committee Democrats, including Mr. Leahy. Judge Kavanaugh denied ever knowingly receiving stolen material when he was a White House aide tasked with getting President George W. Bushs judicial nominees confirmed. On Thursday, questioning Judge Kavanaugh a second time, Mr. Leahy described and put up on posters several emails about his interactions with Mr. Miranda, indicating that he had received permission from the committee chairman around 3 a.m. to disclose them. They included a March 2003 email from Mr. Miranda to Judge Kavanaugh that included several pages of Democratic talking points, marked not for distribution, and another to Judge Kavanaugh from a Republican Senate staff member whose subject line spying and which referred to a mole for us on the left. 
            Subject: spying pic.twitter.com/GuIGHCjwiE  Judge Kavanaugh reiterated that he had no knowledge that Mr. Miranda had infiltrated Democratic files, saying he likely assumed that the Republican staff was getting information from friends who were Democratic staff members and nothing had raised red flags at the time. Advertisement I was born at night but not last night, Mr. Leahy said. If I had something that somebody said, we have stolen this or dont tell anybody we have this, I think it would raise some red flags. Mr. Leahy also pressed him about more than 100,000 documents from his period as a Bush White House lawyer that the Senate has not been permitted to see, even on a confidential basis, because a lawyer for President Bush has said they are subject to executive privilege. Mr. Leahy asked whether Judge Kavanaugh could confirm that none of those contain more such emails from Mr. Miranda.  Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter. You must select a newsletter to subscribe to. View all New York Times newsletters. Senator, I am not involved in the documents process, Judge Kavanaugh. I dont know whats in them. Replied Mr. Leahy: That is convenient. Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, pressed Mr. Kavanaugh on comments he made in support of Justice Antonin Scalias dissent in a case that upheld the constitutionality of an independent counsel. Given your views on Morrison v. Olson, we are obviously worried you will feel bound by this dissent by Scalia if President Trump decides to attempt to fire the special counsel Bob Mueller, Mr. Durbin said. Mr. Kavanaugh began by pushing back on the framing of Mr. Durbins question, noting that case involved the creation of an independent counsel, not a special counsel. But ultimately, he assured the senator, Ive made clear in my writing that when a court order requires a president to do something or prohibits a president from doing something under the constitution or laws of the United States, that is the final word. When it comes to the scope of executive power, he said, I am one not afraid at all in my record of twelve years to invalidate executive power when it violates the law. Later, under questioning from Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware, Judge Kavanaugh pushed back against what he called a misinterpretation of a comment he made at a 1999 round table, when he said, Maybe Nixon was wrongly decided  heresy though it is to say so. He was referring to the 1974 case of United States v. Nixon, where the Supreme Courts ruled unanimously that a sitting president, Richard M. Nixon, could be subpoenaed for documents and records like the Watergate tape recordings. Judge Kavanaugh said he was being wry, and critiquing the strategy of lawyers for President Bill Clinton during the investigation of that president. The tone of voice there has made the printed word look much different than how it was intended, he said, adding that he believes the case was correctly decided, and is one of the four greatest decisions in Supreme Court history. (He did not say what the other three are.) Advertisement Much of the morning was given to what appeared to be real drama, the move by Senator Cory Booker, Democrat of New Jersey, to release committee confidential documents without Republican permission  and Republican threats to exact consequences. After all, such a release could result in Mr. Bookers expulsion from Senate. Bring it, the senator said. Senators Booker and Mazie K. Hirono, Democrat of Hawaii, went ahead and released the documents. This is about the closest Ill ever come in my life to an I am Spartacus moment, Mr. Booker declared. But after the drama subsided, Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said all of those documents were cleared for release overnight. William A. Burck, the former Bush White House lawyer tasked with reviewing the Kavanaugh documents, said in a statement, We cleared the documents last night shortly after Senator Bookers staff asked us to. We were surprised to learn about Senator Bookers histrionics this morning because we had already told him he could use the documents publicly. In fact, we have said yes to every request made by the Senate Democrats to make documents public. The question remains, so why were Republicans handing Mr. Booker his moment, not saying, hey, whats the big deal? As for Mr. Booker, his spokeswoman gave him credit for forcing the documents release  and said this would not be the last of the document kerfuffles. Cory and Senate Democrats were able to shame the committee into agreeing to make last nights documents publicly available, and Cory publicly released those documents as well as other committee confidential documents today, the spokeswoman, Kristin Lynch, said in a statement. And hell keep releasing them because Republicans are hiding Brett Kavanaughs record from the American people. Advertisement Late in Wednesdays proceedings, the questioning finally reached Senator Kamala Harris, Democrat of California, and she launched into tense questioning that centered around whether Judge Kavanaugh had ever discussed the Russia investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, with a lawyer or lawyers from the law firm of President Trumps longtime personal lawyer, Marc Kasowitz. 
            Has Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh had a conversation about Robert Mueller or his investigation with anyone at Trump's personal attorney's law firm?We dont know. He refused to answer my question. pic.twitter.com/PAKxDGvEtZ  Judge Kavanaugh appeared somewhat baffled, but he would not offer a blanket no because he said he didnt know the names of every lawyer who worked for the firm, and he had discussed the Mueller investigation with lawyers and judges. I think youre thinking of someone, and you dont want to tell us, Ms. Harris said without elaboration. Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, gave Judge Kavanaugh an opportunity on Thursday to revisit Ms. Harriss line of questioning. Mr. Kavanaugh responded by acknowledging he doesnt know everyone who works at the firm, but said, I dont recall any conversations of that kind. I havent had any inappropriate conversations about that investigation with anyone, Judge Kavanaugh said. Ive never given anyone any winks, hints, forecasts, previews, nothing, about my view as a judge, or how I would rule as a judge on that or anything related to that. A spokesman for Kasowitz Benson Torres said in a statement Thursday that there have been no discussions regarding Robert Muellers investigation between Judge Kavanaugh and anyone at our firm. In a letter last June to Mr. Mueller, Mr. Kasowitz cited a majority opinion by Judge Kavanaugh, without naming him, saying, The President may decline to prosecute certain violators of federal law just as the President may pardon certain violators of federal law. The President may decline to prosecute or may pardon because of the Presidents own constitutional concerns about a law or because of policy objections to the law, among other reasons. The question is, can and will the senator tell the public what she knows? Most Supreme Court nominees express enthusiasm for cameras in the court at their confirmation hearings, only to change their minds after they join the court. Judge Kavanaugh took a different approach, saying only that I will have an open mind on it. Advertisement He said his current court, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, has recently allowed live audio coverage of its arguments. That development, he said, was a positive one. But he offered only vague comments on electronic coverage of the Supreme Court. The court generally releases audio recording of arguments at the end of the week and does not allow camera coverage. Judge Kavanaugh made one novel suggestion, offering that the court should consider camera coverage of the sessions in which the justices summarize their opinions from the bench. The court, which currently releases audio of those sessions months later, is unlikely to adopt the idea. The justices may be wary of suggesting to the public that their informal oral summaries, rather than their written opinions, precisely set out the details of decisions.

Heres the sign-up.) Good evening. Heres the latest. 1. It was the first day of confirmation hearings for Judge Brett Kavanaughs appointment to the Supreme Court, and it started with a bang. Senate Democrats moved angrily to adjourn to consider tens of thousands of pages of documents released the night before the hearing. They were joined by crowds of protesters, who cried out their support. President Trumps potential legal troubles were a recurring theme, but Republicans praised Judge Kavanaugh and expressed confidence he will be confirmed. The hearings continue through the week. _____ 2. Voters in Massachusetts went to the polls today and elected Ayanna Pressley, 44, above, over 10-term Representative Michael Capuano in a Democratic primary that few said she could win. She is now poised to become the first African-American in the state to be elected to the House of Representatives. Separately, the White House and President Trump are rattled by a forthcoming book that portrays the administration as an out-of-control operation: crazytown, in the reported words of the chief of staff, John Kelly. According to the book, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said the president acted like  and had the understanding of  a fifth or sixth grader. Thats among the most explosive claims in Fear, by Bob Woodward, due out next week. The Times obtained a copy. _____ 3. Even after news that Colin Kaepernick had signed a multimillion-dollar deal with Nike and become a face of its Just Do It campaign, his silence is deafening. The former quarterback started kneeling in protest during the national anthem before N.F.L. games in 2016, and other players soon joined him. Their protest caused a huge outcry, dividing fans and the league owners, captivating celebrities and athletes and motivating President Trump to persistently tweet his anger over it. But Mr. Kaepernick is letting his social media savvy  and a total rejection of interviews  spin the message. _____ 4. $1,000,000,000,000. Amazon became the second American company to reach a market value of $1 trillion. Apple hit that milestone last month, but with Amazon, our reporter writes, the path has been much more complicated. Amazon has revolutionized how people shop  and taught retailers some hard lessons along the way. But theres also been a rise in its brick-and-mortar operations. _____ 5. Other tech giants are under scrutiny over the coming midterm elections. Executives from Facebook, Twitter and Google will testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Wednesday about their preparations to thwart foreign influence campaigns and disinformation. Sheryl Sandberg, Facebooks C.O.O., above. The power their platforms wield over public discourse is enormous. Temporarily barring Alex Jones of Infowars  who regularly spreads lies, conspiracy theories and inflammatory attacks against political enemies  drastically reduced his reach.

Can you tell the difference between a genuine Facebook post and one that was part of an influence campaign? Try your hand with our quiz. _____ 6. Another worry for Facebook: In Libya, it has become a platform for keyboard warriors who stoke violence. In the capital, where violence has broken out between rival militias in recent days, some combatants picked up rocket launchers. Others headed online. Keyboard warriors, as Facebook partisans are known in Libya, issued boasts, taunts and chilling threats online as their counterparts attacked from the ground. Some Facebook users even provided direct coordinates for targeted attacks. Facebook insists it is policing its Libyan platform, but illegal activity is rife. _____ 7. A replacement for John McCain: John Kyl, a former Arizona senator, will fill the seat, though he has committed to serving only until the start of the next Congress, in January. Mr. Kyl has been helping Judge Brett Kavanaugh through the confirmation process. In tapping him to fill it, Gov. Doug Ducey has effectively put the stature of Mr. McCains seat ahead of the political imperative of keeping it in Republican hands, our reporter writes. And in Chicago, Mayor Rahm Emanuel, above, announced he would not seek re-election. This has been the job of a lifetime, but it is not a job for a lifetime, he said. _____ 8. Tropical Storm Gordon is heading for the Gulf Coast and is poised to become the first hurricane to strike the continental United States this year.

Kavanaugh, President Trumps Supreme Court nominee, urged prosecutors investigating President Bill Clinton to question him in graphic detail about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky, a White House intern, according to a memorandum released on Monday by the National Archives. Mr. Kavanaugh spent more than three years working for Ken Starr, the independent counsel who investigated a series of scandals during Mr. Clintons presidency, and he worked on the report that led the House of Representatives to impeach Mr. Clinton. Mr. Kavanaugh drew up the memo as other members of Mr. Starrs team were preparing to question Mr. Clinton. The memo, dated Aug. 15, 1998, was shot through with disgust for Mr. Clintons behavior and seemed animated by the deep animosity that had developed between the White House and Mr. Starrs team. The document betrayed deep hostility to Mr. Clinton, and it included 10 proposed questions about matters like oral sex and masturbation. Former members of Mr. Starrs team have said that Mr. Kavanaugh, who is now a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, immediately regretted its tone. [Read the memo here.] But in the memo, he was unrelenting. The president has disgraced his office, the legal system and the American people by having sex with a 22-year-old intern and turning her life into a shambles  callous and disgusting behavior that has somehow gotten lost in the shuffle, Mr. Kavanaugh wrote. He has committed perjury (at least) in the Jones case, Mr. Kavanaugh wrote, referring to the sexual harassment case brought by Paula Jones, an Arkansas state worker who said Mr. Clinton had made lewd advances toward her in a hotel room when he was governor. He has lied to his aides, Mr. Kavanaugh wrote. He has lied to the American people. He has tried to disgrace you  meaning Mr. Starr  and this office with a sustained propaganda campaign that would make Nixon blush. It may not be our job to impose sanctions on him, but it is our job to make his pattern of revolting behavior clear  piece by painful piece, Mr. Kavanaugh wrote. Arent we failing to fulfill our duty to the American people if we willingly conspire with the president in an effort to conceal the true nature of his acts? To that end, Mr. Kavanaugh wrote, Mr. Clinton should be asked extremely detailed questions unless he first either resigned or admitted to perjury and publicly apologized to Mr. Starr. Mr. Kavanaugh listed 10 possible questions based on Ms. Lewinskys testimony, saying that he would leave the best phrasing to others. Among them were these: If Monica Lewinsky says that you had phone sex with her on approximately 15 occasions, would she be lying? If Monica Lewinsky says that you ejaculated into her mouth on two occasions in the Oval Office area, would she be lying? If Monica Lewinsky says that you masturbated into a trash can in your secretarys office, would she be lying? The substance of the memo has long been available, notably in a 2010 book, The Death of American Virtue: Clinton vs. Starr, by Ken Gormley. But the full memo had not been made public until Monday, and it provided striking details about the hard line Mr. Kavanaugh urged his colleagues to take. In an interview this month, Robert J. Bittman, the deputy counsel who led the Lewinsky prosecution for Mr. Starr, said Mr. Kavanaugh had recognized that the memo was a misstep. Brett immediately regretted the tone of that memo, Mr. Bittman said. My memory is that he was sleep deprived and then quickly realized in retrospect that it was over the top. Mr. Kavanaugh took a different approach when Mr. Starr was about to provide Congress with a report laying out possible grounds for impeachment, urging his colleagues to use discretion in describing Mr. Clintons interactions with Ms. Lewinsky. He lost that fight. The final report included all of the sexual details, and it was quickly made available on the internet. In the memo, Mr. Kavanaugh said he was mindful of the need to respect the office of the president. But in my view, he continued, given what we know, the interests of the office of the president would best be served by gathering the full facts regarding the actions of this president so that the Congress can decide whether the interests of the presidency would best be served by having a new president. The memo was released as tensions between Mr. Trump and Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel investigating links between Mr. Trump and Russia, seem to be rising with each passing day. Judge Kavanaugh seems certain to be questioned about the memo and what it suggests about the Mueller investigation at his confirmation hearings next month. Judge Kavanaugh is likely to say that his views on the wisdom of criminal investigations of sitting presidents have evolved considerably in the two decades since he wrote the memo. I believe that the president should be excused from some of the burdens of ordinary citizenship while serving in office, he wrote in 2009 in the Minnesota Law Review, after an extended stint in the George W. Bush White House and after he became a judge. Among those burdens, Judge Kavanaugh wrote, were responding to civil lawsuits and criminal charges. He said Congress should consider imposing limits on such proceedings. Even the lesser burdens of a criminal investigation  including preparing for questioning by criminal investigators  are time-consuming and distracting, Judge Kavanaugh wrote. Like civil suits, criminal investigations take the presidents focus away from his or her responsibilities to the people. And a president who is concerned about an ongoing criminal investigation is almost inevitably going to do a worse job as president. Judge Kavanaugh said that the proceedings could resume after a president left office and that impeachment remained an option before then. His years of service as staff secretary to Mr. Bush had altered his understanding of the all-consuming nature of the presidency, he wrote in 2009, at the start of the Obama administration. The investigation of Mr. Clinton, he wrote, had been misguided. Like many Americans at that time, I believed that the president should be required to shoulder the same obligations that we all carry, he wrote. But in retrospect, that seems a mistake. Looking back to the late 1990s, for example, Judge Kavanaugh wrote, the nation certainly would have been better off if President Clinton could have focused on Osama bin Laden without being distracted by the Paula Jones sexual harassment case and its criminal investigation offshoots. At the time, though, Mr. Kavanaugh took a hard line, aghast that Mr. Clinton had lied and tarnished the presidency  all to cover up his oral sex from an intern. Michael D.

He is one of three Democrats on the Judiciary Committee  the others are Senators Kamala D. Harris of California and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota  said to be contemplating presidential runs in 2020, and there is no time like a stately, nationally televised Supreme Court nomination hearing to grab the attention of the news media and amass valuable footage for future campaign commercials. Other 2020 hopefuls, notably Senators Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, have been making their own moves this week. Ms. Gillibrand, who has positioned herself as a leading advocate for womens rights, has been appearing with womens groups to protest the nomination, calling it a clear threat to rights that women all across America hold dear. And Ms. Warren, notoriously press shy in the corridors of the Capitol, told Politico on Wednesday that she intended to open up and start giving hallway interviews. But for Ms. Harris and Mr. Booker  and to a lesser extent, Ms. Klobuchar, who is less given to high drama  the hearings have been something like a campaign audition, not to mention the criticism that goes along with it. Running for president is no excuse for violating the rules of the Senate or of confidentiality of the documents that we are privy to, Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, snapped after Mr. Booker made his threat about the emails. (It turned out that Mr. Booker had permission to make those messages public after all, prompting another Republican, Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina, to quip, You didnt have to be Spartacus.) It did not take long  just 13 words into the start of the first day of the hearings  for Ms. Harris to make her mark. The chairman of the Judiciary Committee had just gaveled hearings to order and was about to utter his 14th word when the California senator interrupted, demanding a delay to give the panel time to review a last-minute document dump. We cannot possibly move forward, she protested, as the chairman, Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, promptly ruled her out of order. Throughout the hearings, Ms. Harris, once the California attorney general, drew on her formidable skills as a former prosecutor to repeatedly skewer Judge Kavanaugh and back him into unpleasant corners. Can you think of any laws that give the government the power to make decisions about the male body? she asked at one point, in an exchange that picked up considerable traction on social media. The judge seemed flustered. Im not  Im not  thinking of any right now, senator, he replied. Mr. Booker, for his part, proved his skills at oratory; on Wednesday night, he talked for 23 of the 30 minutes he was allotted to question Judge Kavanaugh, delivering a soaring lecture on racial inequality  even as he repeatedly cut off the nominee while grilling him about his views on affirmative action, racial profiling and voter identification laws. It seems that you are O.K. with using race to single out some Americans for extra security measures because they look different, but youre not O.K. with using race to help promote diversity, Mr. Booker said at one point, while disclosing that the committee had a confidential email titled racial profiling relating to Judge Kavanaugh. For Mr. Booker and Ms. Harris, both darlings of the progressive movement, the hearings are also a chance to demonstrate fidelity to the left. Progressives have become increasingly frustrated with the way Senate Democrats are handling Judge Kavanaughs nomination; on Wednesday, more than a dozen groups sent a scathing letter to Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, accusing him of allowing moderate Democrats to go their own way in considering whether to vote for confirmation. Anything less than 49 Democratic votes against Kavanaugh would be a massive failure of your leadership, read the letter, organized by Credo Action, which bills itself as a social-change network. Republicans, on the other hand, are accusing the Democrats of playing politics with one of the most sacred duties of the Senate: the responsibility to advise and consent on a Supreme Court nomination. Mr. Booker came under withering criticism on Wednesday when he sent a letter to supporters asking for signatures opposing Judge Kavanaugh. The letter, which circulated on Twitter, asked recipients to click through to a website that offered tickets to a coming New Jersey Democratic State Committee event. Then, on Thursday, Ms. Harris sent out her own fund-raising email, spotlighting her does-the-government-have-the-power-to-regulate-the-male-body exchange with Judge Kavanaugh. I know youre standing with me in this fight, and I appreciate everything youve done so far, the missive said, above a bright red link that declared, in all caps, Contribute. Republicans sneered. As Mr. Cornyn, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate, wrote on Twitter, It is all about the 2020 Democrat presidential primary.   video breaking breaking Advertisement",Democrats Grilling Kavanaugh Have Their Eyes on 2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/06/us/politics/kavanaugh-hearings-kamala-harris-cory-booker.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/07/us/politics/07dc-2020-promo/07dc-2020-promo-facebookJumbo.jpg,center

 The Latest: Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh has concluded his opening statement. The committee will resume his confirmation hearings at 9:30 a.m. Wednesday. Heres the latest.  Democrats turned the opening into a brawl, but Republicans pushed through. Opening statements in the hearing were delayed by more than an hour as Democratic senators complained about the limits on their access to documents from Judge Kavanaughs tenure in the Bush administration White House and pressed to adjourn. With protesters shouting and being removed from the room, Democrats sought a vote to postpone the hearing but were denied it. The frequent interruptions led one Republican, Senator John Cornyn of Texas, to call the opening of the hearing mob rule. But the committee chairman, Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, refused to delay the hearings opening day and got through it by about 5 p.m. [Democrats sought to portray Judge Kavanaugh as a hopeless partisan.]  Trumps potential legal troubles were a recurring theme. Many Democrats brought up statements by Judge Kavanaugh suggesting that he would be sympathetic to a sitting president who challenged a subpoena for testimony or an indictment. They suggested that President Trump may have picked him from the ranks of conservative jurists because he was hoping for an ally on the court, should Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel investigating the Trump campaigns ties to Russia, move against the president. Advertisement  Republicans praised Kavanaugh and expressed confidence he will be confirmed. Republicans used their opening statements to praise Judge Kavanaugh as highly qualified and a good man. They accused Democrats of hypocrisy and argued that his 12 years of appeals court rulings, which are public, are the best way to evaluate what kind of Supreme Court justice he would be. And, secure in the knowledge that they control the Senate and can confirmed the judge with a simple majority vote, Republicans expressed confidence that however unruly things get, the Senate will ultimately approve his appointment. Advertisement  The hearing foreshadowed likely Democratic frustration in coming days.  Democrats signaled in their opening statements that they intend to press Judge Kavanaugh to explain in detail what he thinks about contentious legal questions, especially whether the Roe v. Wade abortion rights decision was rightly decided  an issue that could illuminate whether he views it as settled precedent or vulnerable to overturning. But Republicans like Mr. Grassley said it would be inappropriate for him to indicate how he might rule on anything that might come before the court in the future. In his prepared opening statement, Judge Kavanaugh laid the groundwork for disclaiming that he will bring any ideological lens to interpreting ambiguous constitutional text, invoking the ideal of a judge as an umpire  a neutral and impartial arbiter who favors no litigant or policy. The hearing is scheduled to resume at 9:30 a.m. on Wednesday, starting with questioning by Mr. Grassley and by Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the ranking Democrat. Each senator on the committee will have 30 minutes in the first round of questioning and 20 in a second round, which is expected to wrap up on Thursday. Judge Kavanaugh would then be excused, and the senators will question a panel of legal experts who support and oppose his confirmation. Cant get enough? The rest of our dispatches from the day are below.  One of the biggest points of tension in the Kavanaugh confirmation hearings will be Judge Kavanaughs response to Democrats questions about whether he believes certain cases  notably Roe v. Wade, the 1973 landmark decision establishing a constitutional right to abortion  have been correctly decided. In his opening statement, Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the Judiciary Committee chairman, laid the groundwork for Judge Kavanaugh to refuse to answer, by invoking what has come to be known as the Ginsburg rule, after Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who was appointed by a Democratic president, Bill Clinton. [Read Judge Kavanaughs opening statement.] Declaring that it would be unfair and unethical for the judge to answer questions about specific cases, Mr. Grassley said: Its my advice to him to follow the example set by Judge Ginsburg, adding that a nominee should offer no hints, no forecasts, no views. Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the committees ranking Democrat, said a dissent from Judge Kavanaugh opened a window on his views on abortion, one she said indicated that he would not support the constitutional right to abortion established in 1973 in Roe v. Wade. Last year, Judge Kavanaugh said that allowing an undocumented teenager in federal custody to obtain an abortion was based on a constitutional principle as novel as it is wrong: a new right for unlawful immigrant minors in U.S. government detention to obtain immediate abortion on demand. He said he would have given the government more time to find a sponsor for the teenager. Advertisement But Judge Kavanaugh did not join a separate dissent from Judge Karen LeCraft Henderson, who wrote that the teenager had no right to an abortion because she was not a citizen and had entered the country unlawfully. Will a Supreme Court with two Trump-appointed justices overrule the right to an abortion? Its possible, but not the most likely outcome. Adam Liptak, The Timess Supreme Court reporter, explains. Ms. Feinstein is one of the most ardent supporters of gun restrictions in the Senate, and in her opening statement she forecast that she intended to grill Judge Kavanaugh about what she regarded as his out of the mainstream views on gun rights. Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh, President Trumps nominee to the Supreme Court, appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee for the first day of his confirmation hearing. She was referring to a dissent Judge Kavanaugh wrote in a case challenging a District of Columbia law that required gun owners to register their weapons, and banned possession of semiautomatic rifles. The appeals court upheld the limits as constitutionally permissible under the Second Amendment. But in his dissent, Judge Kavanaugh argued that a ban on semiautomatic rifles should be unconstitutional because they have not traditionally been banned and are in common use by law-abiding citizens for self-defense in the home, hunting and other lawful uses. For the senator, the issue of gun violence is personal. She became mayor of San Francisco more than 40 years ago when Mayor George Moscone and Harvey Milk, an openly gay politician, were shot and killed. In her opening statement, she noted that President Trump had promised that whomever he nominated to the Supreme Court would be anti-choice and pro-gun, adding, We believe what he said. Fred Guttenberg, the father of Jaime Guttenberg, a 14-year-old girl killed in the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Parkland, Florida, took to Twitter on Tuesday to say that Mr. Kavanaugh had rebuffed him when he went to introduce himself. 
            Just walked up to Judge Kavanaugh as morning session ended. Put out my hand to introduce myself as Jaime Guttenberg's dad. He pulled his hand back, turned his back to me and walked away. I guess he did not want to deal with the reality of gun violence.         In a video of the hearing, Mr. Guttenberg can be seen approaching the judge as the hearing was breaking for lunch and extending his hand to Judge Kavanaugh. Though it wasnt clear whether Judge Kavanaugh first saw him, the nominee did turn back and look at Mr. Guttenburg, who took a step closer and appeared to say something to him. Judge Kavanaugh then turned and walked away.

(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik) @ap pic.twitter.com/smcCGuLT6X  While Republicans cite Judge Kavanaughs impressive resume  Yale Law degree, Supreme Court clerkship  as a reason to confirm him, Democrats hope to turn the nominees biography against him by portraying him as a partisan hack. Advertisement Before joining the federal appeals court here, Judge Kavanaugh had a long history of Republican political activism. He worked on the team, led by Ken Starr, which investigated former President Bill Clinton. He was in Florida during the presidential recount of 2000, advising then-Gov. George W. Bush. (He also once represented Mr. Bushs brother Jeb.) Later, he joined the Bush White House. The judge has been involved of the most pitched and partisan battles of our lifetimes, Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware, said. Addressing Judge Kavanaugh directly, he added that it is critical that this committee and the American people fully examine your record to understand what kind of justice you would be. Senator Durbin, meanwhile, has called Judge Kavanaugh the Forrest Gump of Republican politics  a phrase he reprised on Tuesday, adding, You always show up in the picture. The hits kept coming: Judge Kavanaugh has been knee deep in partisan politics, Senator Mazie K. Hirono, Democrat of Hawaii, said. The first day of the confirmation hearings for Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh, President Trumps nominee to the Supreme Court, started with Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee pushing to adjourn and protesters being removed. Of course, President Trump also had to weigh in. 
            ....looking to inflict pain and embarrassment to one of the most highly renowned jurists to ever appear before Congress. So sad to see!         Senator Patrick Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, said that Judge Kavanaughs still-hidden White House records could be particularly illuminating on a question of pressing urgency: understanding his views on the scope of executive power  and, in particular, whether sitting presidents should be immune from legal process, like subpoenas to testify in a criminal investigation  while they are in office. Judge Kavanaugh came up in Washington conservative legal circles as a prosecutor working for Kenneth W. Starrs independent counsel investigation into President Bill Clinton. But later, in a speech he made at a law school after serving in President George W. Bushs White House and then becoming a judge, he said that the distraction of preparing for questions by criminal investigators would make a president do a worse job, so presidents should be excused from that burden until after they leave office. Advertisement His remarks were ambiguous: he said Congress should consider enacting a statute granting presidents temporary immunity while in office, which could suggest that the Constitution does not grant presidents that authority on its own. Still, he clearly indicated that he sympathizes with the idea that being subjected to legal process burdens a presidents ability to carry out his constitutional responsibilities. And the Supreme Court has never decided whether a president can be forced to testify in response to a subpoena  something that it may address if Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel investigating President Trumps campaign ties to Russia, were to subpoena him. Against that backdrop, Mr. Leahy said that Judge Kavanaughs expansive view of executive power and executive immunity may have intrigued Mr. Trump, while also noting that the president over the weekend attacked Attorney General Jeff Sessions for permitting the Justice Department to indict two Republican congressmen ahead of the midterm election. Youve taken the unorthodox position that presidents should not be burdened with a criminal or civil investigation while in office. Now we have a president who has declared in the last 24 hours that the Department of Justice shouldnt prosecute Republicans, Mr. Leahy said. Now, its  its Alice in Wonderland. And I find it difficult to imagine that your views on this subject escape the attention of President Trump, who seems increasingly fixated on his own ballooning legal jeopardy. Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, picked up that line of attack, focusing on what he said were convenient inconsistencies in Judge Kavanaughs views on whether sitting presidents can be questioned in criminal investigations. As a lawyer working for Mr. Starr, Judge Kavanaugh urged his superiors to question Mr. Clinton in graphic detail. After serving as Mr. Bushs staff secretary, though, Judge Kavanaughs views evolved. I believe that the president should be excused from some of the burdens of ordinary citizenship while serving in office, he wrote in 2009 in the Minnesota Law Review. Among those burdens, Judge Kavanaugh wrote, were responding to civil lawsuits and criminal charges. Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, can always be counted on to criticize Mr. Trump, and on Tuesday he did not disappoint. Mr. Flake began his opening statement by praising Judge Kavanaugh as a good family man and a fine athlete  the judge runs marathons. But then he pivoted to express serious concerns over how Judge Kavanaugh will deal with a president who does not seem to respect the institutions of government or the rule of law.  Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter. You must select a newsletter to subscribe to. View all New York Times newsletters. After reading aloud Mr. Trumps weekend tweet attacking Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Mr. Flake said, That is why a lot of people are concerned about this administration and why they want to ensure that our institutions hold. But while he pledged to question Judge Kavanaugh closely on his view of executive power, Mr. Flake is widely expected to be a yes vote when it comes to the judges confirmation. Advertisement Judge Kavanaughs nomination has been controversial at his alma mater, Yale Law School, Senator Ben Sasse, Republican of Nebraska, noted. Many hundreds of current and former law students there signed an open letter chastising the law schools administration for issuing a news release noting his nomination and gathering positive comments from faculty members. 
                President Trump is moving quickly to appoint federal judges. So far, his efforts have strengthened conservative majorities rather than changed the balance of most courts.             Judge Kavanaughs nomination, the letter said, presents an emergency  for democratic life, for our safety and freedom, for the future of our country. The law schools news release concerning Judge Kavanaugh was similar to earlier ones issued after other alumni were nominated to high positions, including Justice Sonia Sotomayor and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. A second open letter, also signed by hundreds of current and former students, wrote that Judge Kavanaugh has been a valuable friend to the Yale community and was eminently qualified to serve as a Supreme Court justice. The moment Judge Kavanaughs confirmation hearing opened, Democrats and protesters turned it into a verbal brawl. Senator Kamala Harris, Democrat of California, immediately interrupted the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Charles E. Grassley, demanding a delay to consider tens of thousands of pages of documents released Monday  the night before the hearing and a holiday. Other Democrats backed her, especially the senators considering a run for the White House in 2020, as did womens rights protesters, several of whom were arrested and thrown out as they decried the sessions as a sham. We cannot possibly move forward, Mr. Chairman, with this hearing, one of the presidential aspirants, Senator Harris, declared. Advertisement Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut called the hearing a charade and a mockery. What are we trying to hide? Why are we rushing? asked Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont. As the Democrats spoke, activists were dragged, shouting, one by one out of the hearing room. We dissent! Vote no! Vote no! one cried. [Read more about how the G.O.P. under Trump is carrying out a sweeping transformation of the federal judiciary.] Mr. Grassley argued that the committee has received more materials on Judge Kavanaugh than we have had on any Supreme Court nominee in history. He said Republican aides have already reviewed the 42,000 documents that arrived Monday night. Thats no reason to delay the hearing. Democrats quieted down  temporarily  and the hearing appeared to be getting underway with Judge Kavanaugh introducing his family  including his wife, his parents, an aunt and uncle and cousins. But as soon as he finished, Democrats renewed their request to delay the hearing. The fight over records concerning Judge Kavanaugh came as no surprise to Senate Republicans. Some of them, including Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader, feared in July  when President Trump was choosing among the finalists  that Judge Kavanaughs enormous paper trail could stall his nomination Confirmation hearings for Supreme Court nominees didnt always exist. But the 19th Amendment, school desegregation and television all contributed to major changes in the process. New York Times reporters Maggie Haberman and Jonathan Martin wrote at the time that Mr. McConnell made clear in multiple phone calls with Mr. Trump and the White House counsel, Donald F. McGahn II, that Judge Kavanaughs paper trail would pose difficulties for his confirmation. Advertisement Because the number of pages ran into the millions, Mr. McConnell said they could hand Senate Democrats an opportunity to delay the confirmation vote until after the new session of the Supreme Court began in October. Democrats focused intensely on the amount of information they say is being withheld from them about Judge Kavanaughs work in the White House under President George W. Bush. 
            Its unprecedented for the Senate Judiciary Committee to be considering a nominee for the highest court in the land without reviewing documents from 35 months of his public service in the White House. #WhatAreTheyHiding pic.twitter.com/eE7ThqLUZH  Thousands of pages of records have not yet been made public, and on Friday the Trump administration asserted executive privilege and refused to release more than 100,000 pages of records about Judge Kavanaughs time in the Bush White House. An additional 42,000 pages of documents were released the night before the hearing, according to Senator Chuck Schumer, the minority leader, who raised complaints about the timing. 
             The Senate was just given an additional 42,000 pages of Kavanaugh documents the NIGHT BEFORE his confirmation hearing. This underscores just how absurd this process is. Not a single senator will be able to review these records before tomorrow.         A press officer for the committee, responding via the committees Twitter account a few hours later, said the majority staff had completed its review of each and every one of these pages. About a dozen women, dressed in red robes and white bonnets in the fashion of The Handmaids Tale, stood silently, as if in prayer, outside the hearing room. In the atrium of the Hart Senate Office Building, just off the hearing room, over 250 activists from womens rights groups held a vigil in protest, sharing stories underscoring the importance of reproductive rights. They were joined by Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, the New York Democrat, who gave brief remarks, and gave a thunderous cheer when Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, joined them and took pictures with enthralled fans. Inside the chamber, protesters were arrested one by one, leaving once-coveted seats in the hearing room empty. 
            After the arrests at the Kavanaugh Hearing there are plenty of seats open in the hearing room: pic.twitter.com/LV0LC14HEf  The Womens March took credit for the protests, and said more than 30 women have been arrested so far. (So have a few men.) Advertisement Women are disrupting this hearing today because our lives are at risk, Rachel OLeary Carmona, chief operating officer of the Womens March, said in an emailed statement. Women will die if Kavanaugh is confirmed. One protester, referencing the withholding of records relating to Judge Kavanaugh, offered what was perhaps the days most unusual shout: I had to have a background check to work in a laundromat! For Democrats on the committee with possible presidential aspirations  including Senators Cory Booker of New Jersey, Harris and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota  the televised hearings offer an opportunity for combative questioning that can fuel both viral clips and material for a 2020 campaign. It is unclear how much Senator Feinstein will attempt to direct the questioning from members of her own party. As the Senates most ardent proponent of gun restrictions, she is expected to grill Judge Kavanaugh on a 2009 dissent in which he argued against banning semiautomatic weapons. Ms. Feinstein, who was the chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee when it conducted an investigation into the Bush administrations torture program after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, may also pursue her own line of questioning over Judge Kavanaughs time as an associate White House counsel  especially his offer to help a senior administration official prepare testimony about the governments surveillance of conversations between certain terrorism suspects and their lawyers. That offer, revealed in a trove of documents released ahead of the confirmation hearing, contradicts Judge Kavanaughs 2006 testimony, in which he told lawmakers he was not involved in the questions about the rules governing detention of combatants. Democrats have charged that the statement, made in a White House email, was a lie, although it is unknown if Judge Kavanaugh actually provided assistance.

But she wont be the last. By Michelle Goldberg Opinion Columnist Shortly after his inauguration, Donald Trump, uniquely attentive to his debt to the religious right, appointed the anti-abortion activist E. Scott Lloyd to head the Office of Refugee Resettlement, despite Lloyds lack of relevant experience. The position gave Lloyd authority over unaccompanied minors caught crossing into the United States, authority Lloyd exploited to try to stop pregnant migrants from getting abortions. Last year, thanks to Lloyds interference, a 17-year-old from Central America had to wage a legal battle to end her pregnancy. Known in court filings as Jane Doe, the girl learned she was pregnant while in custody in Texas, and was adamant that she wanted an abortion. In keeping with Texass parental consent law, she obtained a judges permission, helped by a legal organization called Janes Due Process. Janes Due Process raised money for the abortion, which was scheduled for the end of her first trimester. But under Lloyds direction, the shelter where she was being detained refused to cooperate. Doe went back to court, and a federal judge ruled in her favor, issuing a temporary restraining order against the government. The administration appealed, and the case, Garza v. Hargan, went to a three-judge panel of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. One of the judges was Brett Kavanaugh. Garza v. Hargan was the only major abortion-rights case Kavanaugh ever ruled on. His handling of it offers a clue about whats in store for American women if hes confirmed to the Supreme Court. No one knows whether Kavanaugh would vote to overturn Roe v. Wade outright or simply gut it. But even on a lower court, Kavanaugh put arbitrary obstacles in the way of someone desperate to end her pregnancy. Thanks to Trump, he may soon be in a position to do the same to millions of others. Its fitting that last weeks Kavanaugh confirmation hearings were regularly interrupted by the sound of women screaming. Again and again, protesters, most of them female, cried out for the preservation of their rights, and were arrested. Republican men were contemptuous. Whats the hysteria coming from? asked Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska. Let me answer. It is true, as Sasse said, that protesters have claimed for many years that if Roe v. Wade is overturned, women will die. Its a fair prediction; women died before Roe, and where abortion is illegal, unsafe abortion leads to maternal death. In the past, however, Roe has been saved. Should Kavanaugh be confirmed, it will either fall or be eviscerated.  In Garza, Kavanaugh and another judge vacated the temporary restraining order that prevented the government from hindering Does abortion. Brigitte Amiri, an A.C.L.U. lawyer who represented the girl, was stunned, because it seemed clear that Doe, whod already obtained the necessary judicial signoff, had the law on her side. It wasnt what I was expecting from any judge that would have read Roe v. Wade, Amiri said of the ruling. Conservatives, progressives, anyone. Indeed, a few days later, the full court reversed the panels decision. Kavanaugh, dissenting, wrote that the government has permissible interests in favoring fetal life. By the time Jane Doe got her abortion, she was 15 weeks pregnant and needed a more complicated second-trimester procedure. On Friday, Rochelle Garza, a lawyer who served as Does temporary legal guardian during the proceedings, testified at Kavanaughs confirmation hearings. She was one of the most vulnerable people in our community, Garza said of the girl, adding, She was an immigrant, she didnt speak English, she was in detention, and she was being put under extreme pressure. And I felt it was unfortunate that Judge Kavanaugh did not take that into consideration. We shouldnt expect a Trump nominee, however personally decent his friends say he is, to care about womens wishes. Kavanaughs defenders insist that hes the sort of judge any Republican would appoint, and they are correct. Still, its a particularly bitter insult that women stand to lose reproductive autonomy thanks to the minority presidential victory of a louche misogynist.  Politicians sometimes say that they are personally opposed to abortion, but believe it should be legal. Trump and some of his enablers reverse that formulation. The president, who does not, according to two of his lovers, wear condoms, has declined to say whether hes ever been involved with an abortion. According to court papers unsealed on Friday, Elliott Broidy, former deputy finance chairman of the Republican National Committee, also refused to wear condoms during sex with his mistress, Shera Bechard, then demanded she get an abortion when she became pregnant. According to the unsealed papers, Broidy admired Trumps uncanny ability to sexually abuse woman and get away with it. A famous pro-choice poster from the 1980s proclaimed, Your body is a battleground. Kavanaugh is likely to join the Supreme Court because in 2016, the woman whom most women voted for was defeated. Now our bodies are subject to occupation. Michelle Goldberg has been an Opinion columnist since 2017.

As a White House lawyer in the George W. Bush administration, Judge Brett Kavanaugh raised doubts about whether Roe v. Wade, the landmark Supreme Court ruling that found a constitutional right to an abortion, was settled law, according to an email made available to The Times. He also called an affirmative action regulation a naked racial set-aside. The email, written in March 2003, is one of thousands of documents that were turned over to the Senate Judiciary Committee before confirmation hearings for Judge Kavanaugh, President Trumps Supreme Court nominee, but that were not made public or available for discussion by Democrats. The document was among several provided to The Times late Wednesday. The news is likely to take center stage today, the third day of Judge Kavanaughs confirmation hearings.

Kavanaugh.,,0.081,0.848,0.071,2018-09-07T23:48:59Z,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,0.3983594248129129,"Advertisement Supported by By Charlie Savage and Sheryl Gay Stolberg WASHINGTON  Senate Democrats and their allies accused Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh on Friday of misleading the Judiciary Committee, saying he dissembled in testimony about crucial issues ranging from his views on abortion rights to his involvement in several Bush-era controversies. But Republicans expressed confidence that none of the punches Democrats had thrown at the Supreme Court nominee had landed with sufficient force to jeopardize his confirmation. Four days of Supreme Court confirmation hearings ended on Friday the way they began, with sharply partisan charges and tension remarkable for normally staid proceedings. In two of the strongest statements on Friday, Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the top Democrat on the committee, said on Twitter that Judge Kavanaugh gave answers that were not true when asked whether he had used materials stolen from committee Democrats when he was a White House lawyer under President George W. Bush. Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, also using Twitter, accused the judge of lying. What else is he lying about? Mr. Wyden wrote. His views on overturning #RoevWade? Whether he was involved in Bush-era torture programs? Whether he believes Trump can pardon himself? Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, raised the volume on Saturday morning. But Raj Shah, a White House spokesman, dismissed the complaints by Democrats and liberals, while attacking those who made public some of Judge Kavanaughs White House emails that were provided to the Judiciary Committee but marked confidential, meaning they were not to be disclosed. We should put these Democratic senators under oath, because they are the ones deliberately misleading the public, Mr. Shah said. Theyve violated Senate rules, leaked confidential information and trafficked in conspiracy theories  all in a desperate attempt to smear Judge Kavanaughs stellar reputation. The good news for the country is that it has been a resounding failure. Mr. Shahs final point may prove true. Senate Democratic staff members, preparing for the next phase of the fight, circulated a draft document on Friday titled Judge Kavanaugh Misled the Judiciary in 2004 and 2006 and Has Done So Once Again. But with no Republican senator signaling any concern, and with the party holding 51 votes in the Senate, Judge Kavanaughs confirmation appeared likely, even as questions linger over documents that remain hidden from the public. I expect that over the next months, even years, all of the relevant documents will eventually become public and we may well end up having a much clearer record in a number of the incidents that were debated very fiercely, said Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware. And at that point, he added, Judge Kavanaugh will most likely be serving as a justice of the Supreme Court. Here are some of the issues that arose during the hearing, and how Judge Kavanaugh addressed them: Mr. Leahy pushed Judge Kavanaugh on his testimony, during his 2004 and 2006 appeals court confirmation hearings, that he neither knew nor suspected that a Republican Senate aide with whom he had interacted, Manuel Miranda, had infiltrated the computer files of Judiciary Committee Democrats about which of Mr. Bushs appeals court nominees Democrats would try to block and with what tactics. Mr. Leahy cited numerous emails that Mr. Miranda had sent Judge Kavanaugh and a few other officials during that period, including verbatim internal Democratic talking points, a draft Democratic letter that was not yet public, intel about what questions Mr. Leahy was planning to ask a nominee at a coming hearing, and an email chain about meeting at Mr. Mirandas apartment to obtain useful info about two other Democratic senators. But Judge Kavanaugh testified that none of the information he received had raised a red flag, suggesting that he had assumed the Republican Senate aides were instead receiving information from friends on the Democratic staff. Separately, Mr. Miranda told The New York Times that he never informed Judge Kavanaugh about the computer server. I am not satisfied with the answers, certainly on the stolen Manny Miranda material, Mr. Leahy said on Friday. I think its fair to say that he was not forthright with me and Im bothered by it. A Democratic lawyer who saw some of her work copied by Mr. Miranda concluded on Slate.com on Friday that Judge Kavanaugh not only should not be confirmed but also should perhaps be impeached. As an appeals court nominee, Judge Kavanaugh distanced himself from significant involvement with two other Bush appeals court nominees who attracted controversy, Charles W. Pickering Sr. and William H. Pryor Jr. While he acknowledged in writing that he had participated in discussions and meetings concerning all of the presidents judicial nominations as a member of a judicial selection committee, he told senators that Judge Pryor was not one that I worked on personally and Judge Pickering was not one of the judicial nominees that I was primarily handling. Still, emails showed he did do some work on both nominations. Among other things, Judge Kavanaugh was invited to participate in a conference call about Judge Pryors pending confirmation hearing in an email that went to a Pryor Working Group, and he performed a variety of tasks on the Pickering nomination, like meeting with Senate aides about him and handling a draft opinion article that supported Mr. Pickering. A colleague identified him as one of two White House lawyers who had been much more involved in the Pickering fight. In August, after Democrats suggested that Judge Kavanaugh had misled the Senate about his involvement in the Pickering nomination, his defenders said he was not the White House official assigned to primarily handle that one. Asked at the hearing about the Pryor nomination, Mr. Kavanaugh gave a similar answer. Judge Kavanaugh also faced scrutiny from Mr. Leahy over his statement to Mr. Leahy in his 2006 confirmation hearing that he had first learned about the Bush administrations warrantless surveillance program from a December 2005 news article. Mr. Leahy had been asking what he had seen in his role as staff secretary from 2003 to 2006. Yet a Sept. 17, 2001, email showed that Judge Kavanaugh  then a White House lawyer, not staff secretary  asked John Yoo, a Justice Department lawyer, whether there were any results yet on the Fourth Amendment implications of warrantless surveillance for counterterrorism purposes. Later that day, Mr. Yoo completed a memo on a hypothetical warrantless wiretapping program that evolved into a more extensive memo that Mr. Yoo signed on Oct. 4, 2001, the day the program secretly started. Insisting that his testimony had been 100 percent accurate, Judge Kavanaugh said that in the early days after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, White House lawyers worked on many things related to national security, but he had never been read into the existence of the surveillance program. Mr. Yoo corroborated that account. Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, grilled Judge Kavanaugh about his testimony over his involvement in Bush administration policy for the handling of captured terrorism suspects. As an appeals court nominee, Judge Kavanaugh turned aside questions about torture by saying that he was not involved in the questions about the rules governing detention of combatants and portrayed his portfolio as focusing on civil justice issues like terrorism insurance. It later emerged that when the Bush administration was internally debating whether American citizens being held as enemy combatants should have access to lawyers, Judge Kavanaugh had advised that the Supreme Court justice Anthony M. Kennedy would probably rule that they had a right to them. An email also showed that in September 2001, he volunteered to prepare a senior Bush administration official to testify about the governments monitoring of conversations between federal terrorism inmates and their lawyers. But Judge Kavanaugh said that my testimony then was accurate and was the truth. He said he had understood Mr. Durbins question in 2006 to be about the Bush administrations enhanced interrogation program, which he was not involved in. As for the signing statement about the torture ban, he said his role as staff secretary was to hand papers to the president that had been prepared by others. On Wednesday, Judge Kavanaugh told Ms. Feinstein that he considered the 1972 abortion rights ruling, Roe v. Wade, to be a settled as a precedent of the Supreme Court entitled the respect under principles of a legal doctrine that justices should not lightly reopen already decided issues. But a 2003 White House email by Judge Kavanaugh  which emerged into public view on Thursday morning  showed that he had objected to a line in a draft opinion article stating that it is widely accepted by legal scholars across the board that Roe v. Wade and its progeny are the settled law of the land. He proposed deleting that line, writing: I am not sure that all legal scholars refer to Roe as the settled law of the land at the Supreme Court level since court can always overrule its precedent, and three current justices on the court would do so. Although his email stopped short of saying what he personally believed, Democrats and abortion rights advocates portrayed that as a contradiction that suggested he was being evasive and did not believe Roe was settled. But Judge Kavanaugh told Ms. Feinstein on Thursday that he had only meant that the line inaccurately overstated the position of legal scholars and reiterated that Roe was a precedent that had been reaffirmed repeatedly.

Its shocking but no longer surprising. By David Leonhardt Opinion Columnist First, the revelations about the Trump White House in Bob Woodwards forthcoming book are shocking. Many White House officials do not respect the president, and theyre quite happy to leak damaging anecdotes about him. For anyone who spent time in Washington during the Bush and Obama years  when both presidents were largely revered by their staffs  its a jarring change.  But it is no longer surprising. Its been abundantly clear for a long time that President Trump is unfit for the office  and that the people who work for him somehow manage both to disdain him and to continue protecting him at the expense of the country. For more, read The Washington Posts summary of the book and Jonathan Chaits commentary about it for New York magazine.  The Supreme Court. The raucous opening day of Judge Brett Kavanaughs confirmation hearing wasnt, for the most part, about him. It was about the Republican Partys hardball, rule-changing tactics in transforming the federal courts.  Democrats are driving home that Republicans keep changing the rules, Voxs Tara Golshan wrote. In particular, Democrats yesterday were blasting the last-minute release  without time for scrutiny  of tens of thousands of documents related to Kavanaughs time as a White House aide during George W. Bushs presidency.  This is not the debate Republicans wanted to have, James Wallner, a former Republican Senate staff member, tweeted yesterday morning. Note: Kavanaugh hasnt been debated once. Its just the process, the documents. Democrats have framed this debate 100%. A little history is useful here. Both parties, without question, have played a role in making the courts more partisan and overtly political. As Republicans like to emphasize, the Democrats were the ones who first rejected a nominee based strictly on ideology: Robert Bork, in 1987. In Borks place, President Ronald Reagan ultimately nominated the more moderate Anthony Kennedy, whose retirement in turn led to Kavanaughs nomination. But its also the case that Republicans have done much more than Democrats to politicize the courts. How so? One, they have rejected a significantly higher percentage of Democratic nominees since 1981 than Democrats have rejected Republican nominees, according to data collected by the legal scholar Russell Wheeler. This high rejection rate eventually led Senate Democrats during the Obama years to eliminate the filibuster for federal appeals court judges. (That move has recently received criticism, because Republicans later did the same for Supreme Court nominees, but I still think Democrats had no better alternative, given Republican obstruction.) Two, Republicans have nominated more politically extreme judges than Democrats have, as research by Lee Epstein of Washington University and others has shown. Jason Zengerles recent Times Magazine piece and the accompanying episode of The Daily podcast have more details. Three, Republicans stole a Supreme Court seat by refusing to let President Barack Obama fill a vacancy in 2016. There was no precedent for such a move, and it was vastly more radical than anything Democrats have done. The seat effectively decided many of the courts biggest cases last year, and it will shape the court for decades. As Ive written before, I expect the Senate to confirm Kavanaugh. Republicans have the votes to do so, and theyve shown no signs of splintering. If Im right about that, this weeks hearings are more about framing the debate over the future of the courts than anything else.  And Democrats are absolutely right to use the occasion to explain how radical Senate Republicans  and, by extension, large parts of the federal judiciary  have become.  Finally, Congressional districts change over the years. But the closest thing to todays Seventh Congressional District in Massachusetts was previously represented by John F. Kennedy, Tip ONeill and Joe Kennedy II.  Starting in January, it will almost certainly be represented by Ayanna Pressley, who beat the incumbent handily in the Democratic primary last night. She would be the first African-American ever to represent Massachusetts in the House.  You can join me on Twitter (@DLeonhardt) and Facebook. You can subscribe to this newsletter here.

Kavanaugh as a narrow-minded partisan as the opening day of his confirmation hearings verged on pandemonium. Dozens of screaming protesters were hauled out of the hearing room in handcuffs. The verbal brawl began moments after the hearings began. Democrats, furious at being denied access to records related to Judge Kavanaugh, immediately interrupted the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, demanding time to consider tens of thousands of pages of documents released late Monday  the night before the hearing. Judge Kavanaugh, who finally had the microphone hours later, portrayed himself as an impartial jurist and affable family man. I am not a pro-plaintiff or pro-defendant judge, Judge Kavanaugh told the committee. Im not a pro-prosecution or pro-defense judge. I am a pro-law judge. But the hearings were dominated by Democratic theatrics and crackling protests. For more than an hour at the outset, irate Democrats and a frustrated Mr. Grassley parried back and forth. Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, denounced the hearing as a charade and a mockery and repeatedly moved to adjourn, while Mr. Grassley ruled him out of order over and over again. At one point, Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, accused Democrats of engaging in mob rule. Protesters, most of them women, shouted down senators; by days end, Capitol Police said a total of 70 people had been arrested, including nine outside the room. It was a chaotic start to what would ordinarily be a staid, albeit deeply consequential, process. And barring an astounding revelation, the path remains clear for Judge Kavanaughs ultimate confirmation  probably this month. If he is confirmed, he could shape American jurisprudence for decades to come, replacing the retired Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, a critical swing vote on divisive matters like same-sex marriage and abortion, with an unabashed conservative. The session, which mostly settled down by the afternoon, also gave Americans their first extended glimpse of Judge Kavanaugh, 53, who brought his family  his wife and two daughters, his parents, an aunt and uncle and some cousins  along with him. He talked about going to ball games with his father and coaching his daughter in basketball, drawing bipartisan smiles when he gave a shoutout to each member of the team. But that was about the extent of the comity; just days after members of the Senate had gathered together in a bipartisan show of civility at the funeral of Senator John McCain, the crowded hearing room in the Hart Senate Office Building seethed with antipathy. Some of it reflected lingering bitterness over the treatment of Judge Merrick B. Garland, whose nomination to the Supreme Court in 2016 by President Barack Obama was not even considered by Senate Republicans. In his opening statement, Judge Kavanaugh made a point of praising his colleagues on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit  and one in particular. I have served with 17 other judges, each of them a colleague and a friend, on a court now led by our superb chief judge, Merrick Garland, Judge Kavanaugh said While Republicans cited Judge Kavanaughs impressive rsum  Yale Law degree, Supreme Court clerkship  as a reason to confirm him, Democrats made clear that they are laying the groundwork to turn the nominees biography against him. Before joining the federal appeals court, Judge Kavanaugh had a long history of Republican political activism. He worked on the team, led by Ken Starr, that investigated former President Bill Clinton. He was in Florida during the presidential recount of 2000, advising George W. Bush, the governor at the time. (He also once represented Mr. Bushs brother Jeb.) Later, he joined the Bush White House. Judge Kavanaugh has been knee deep in partisan politics, said Senator Mazie K. Hirono, Democrat of Hawaii. Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware, said the nominee had been involved in some of of the most pitched and partisan battles of our lifetimes. Addressing Judge Kavanaugh directly, Mr. Coons added that it was critical that this committee and the American people fully examine your record to understand what kind of justice you would be. Democrats have been complaining for weeks that the document production process, supervised by a lawyer for former President Bush, is rigged. Only a portion of documents relating to Judge Kavanaughs time in the White House Counsels Office have been made available to the committee  and many of those are being kept from the public. And the committee has received no documents from Judge Kavanaughs time as staff secretary to Mr. Bush, a role that he has said was the most interesting and informative for me, as preparations for his work as a judge. Republicans countered that Democrats were harping on access to documents because they could not quibble with Judge Kavanaughs qualifications. And they took digs at their Democratic colleagues on the judiciary panel, several of whom  Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Cory Booker of New Jersey and Kamala D. Harris of California  are weighing presidential runs. This is not about documents, said Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas. Its not about qualification. Its not about record. What it is about is politics. It is about Democratic senators trying to re-litigate the 2016 election, and, just as importantly, working to begin litigating the 2020 presidential election. Senator Patrick Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, said that Judge Kavanaughs still-hidden White House records could be particularly illuminating on a question of pressing urgency: understanding his views on the scope of executive power  in particular, whether sitting presidents should be immune from the legal process, like subpoenas to testify in a criminal investigation. As a lawyer working for Mr. Starr, Judge Kavanaugh urged his superiors to question Mr. Clinton in graphic detail. But his views on the topic have evolved considerably since then. In a speech he made at a law school after serving in the Bush White House and then becoming a judge, he said that the distraction of preparing for questions by criminal investigators would make a president do a worse job, so presidents should be excused from that burden until after they leave office. Democrats insinuated that Mr. Trump nominated Judge Kavanaugh because he believed the judge would protect him from the investigation being conducted by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel. Youve taken the unorthodox position that presidents should not be burdened with a criminal or civil investigation while in office, Mr. Leahy said. Now we have a president who has declared in the last 24 hours that the Department of Justice shouldnt prosecute Republicans, Mr. Leahy said. Now, its  its Alice in Wonderland. And I find it difficult to imagine that your views on this subject escape the attention of President Trump, who seems increasingly fixated on his own ballooning legal jeopardy. Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, picked up that line of attack, focusing on what he said were convenient inconsistencies in Judge Kavanaughs views on whether sitting presidents could be questioned in criminal investigations. This is a president whos shown us consistently that hes contemptuous of the rule of law, Mr. Durbin said. Its that president whos decided you are his man. So are people nervous about this? Mr. Durbin continued. Are they concerned about it? Of course they are. Many of those who are nervous were seated in the audience, including Linda Sarsour, a founder of the Womens March, who was one of the first in line to attend the hearing  and one of the first to be arrested. Also in the room was Fred Guttenberg, the father of Jaime Guttenberg, a 14-year-old girl killed in the school shooting in Parkland, Fla., who created a buzz on Twitter after Judge Kavanaugh appeared to rebuff his effort to shake the nominees hand. Tuesdays hearings consisted of only opening statements. When questioning begins on Wednesday, Judge Kavanaugh is sure to face a detailed examination of his views on abortion. Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, expressed concern that Judge Kavanaugh would vote to overturn Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that established a constitutional right to abortion. She cited a dissent last year in which Judge Kavanaugh said he would have delayed an abortion sought by an undocumented teenager in government custody. Judge Kavanaugh said that allowing an undocumented teenager in federal custody to obtain an abortion was based on a constitutional principle as novel as it is wrong: a new right for unlawful immigrant minors in U.S. government detention to obtain immediate abortion on demand. He said he would have given the government more time to find a sponsor for the teenager. In his opening statement, Judge Kavanaugh said he would model himself on Justice Kennedy, for whom he once served as a law clerk. In the process, Judge Kavanaugh sought to assure the committee that he would be a neutral and impartial arbiter who favors no litigant or policy. As Justice Kennedy showed us, a judge must be independent, not swayed by public pressure, Judge Kavanaugh said. Our independent judiciary is the crown jewel of our constitutional republic. In our independent judiciary, the Supreme Court is the last line of defense for the separation of powers, and the rights and liberties guaranteed by the Constitution. An earlier version of this article misstated the proportion of documents from Judge Brett Kavanaughs time in the White House Counsels Office that have been made available to the Senate Judiciary Committee. The committee was given 445,000 of 663,000 total documents, which is a portion but not a small portion of the total. Charlie Savage and Catie Edmondson contributed reporting.

Oliver (Want to get this briefing by email? Heres the sign-up.) Good evening. Heres the latest. 1. President Trump called on the Justice Department to investigate who wrote an anonymous Op-Ed in The New York Times assailing his administration. I would say Jeff should be investigating who the author of that piece was because I really believe its national security, he said on Air Force One, referring to Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Separately, George Papadopoulos, a former Trump campaign adviser who last year pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I., was sentenced to 14 days in jail. _____ 2. Despite President Trumps rage, this week illustrated why almost all elected Republicans have quietly supported him through his travails  or at least not chastised him too loudly. As the confirmation hearings for Judge Brett Kavanaugh came to a close, Senate Republicans pressed steadily through angry liberal protests and sharp questions fromDemocrats. It may deliver one of the Trump administrations most enduring legacies: an ideological shift in the Supreme Court that will last for decades. Above, Senator Charles Grassley, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. For an idea of what abortion rights may look like if Judge Kavanaugh joins the Supreme Court, our reporter writes, just look to Arkansas. _____ 3. The U.S. added 201,000 jobs last month, slightly topping analysts expectations. The unemployment rate stayed at 3.9 percent, but a 0.4 percent monthly increase in average hourly earnings relieved some of the anxiety about sluggish wages. President Trump escalated the trade dispute with China, threatening to tax virtually all Chinese imports. But so far, political intrigue and anxieties over a trade war have done little to dent a 95-month streak of job creation. _____ 4. More turbulence at Tesla. Shares dropped sharply after news that its accounting chief had departed just weeks after joining the company. The departure is the latest in a string of nearly a dozen top executives who have left Tesla this year. Hours earlier, Teslas chief executive, Elon Musk, appeared live on YouTube in an interview with the comedian Joe Rogan and seemed to be smoking marijuana. Mr. Musks stability and managerial fitness have come under scrutiny after he unexpectedly tweeted he planned to take the company private, then reversed course. _____ 5. Alex Jones is facing a reckoning. After news that Twitter had permanently banned his personal account and that of Infowars, his company, the big question is whether his hallmark bluster can see him out of his current peril. With tech giants  including Facebook, Pinterest, YouTube and Apple  cracking down on him, Mr. Joness ability to reach his audience has been cut off. But hes as much marketer as ideological warrior, selling products to assuage the fears he is so expert at stoking. And true to form, hes been using the challenge to move more product. _____ 6. The E.P.A. is reviewing a major law that restricts mercury emissions by coal-burning power plants. The rule, based on decades of research showing that mercury damages the brain, lungs and fetal health, is among the agencys costliest but most effective clean-air policies. The re-evaluation fits into a far-reaching administration strategy to loosen environmental rules affecting countless other industries for years to come by adjusting the factors used to judge the benefits to human health that the rule has brought. _____ 7. The latest from the U.S. Open: Rafael Nadal, the No. 1 seed and defending champion, struggled with a sore knee and ended up retiring from his semifinal against No. 3 Juan Martn del Potro. Novak Djokovic and 21st-seeded Kei Nishikori are vying for the chance to face Del Potro Sunday afternoon. He will be playing his first Grand Slam final since beating Roger Federer to win the U.S. Open in 2009. And Serena Williams will play Naomi Osaka on Saturday. Ms. Williams will be trying to tie Margaret Courts record of 24 major singles titles, while Ms. Osaka will be aiming to duplicate a win this spring over Ms. Williams and claim her first Grand Slam title. Check back for updates and results. _____ 8. Voters in Sweden  head to the polls on Sunday, and immigration and crime have taken center stage. The far right is expected to take one-fifth of the vote, and some Swedes worry that one such party is becoming normalized. That gives a playground for the real Nazi parties to play and get more ground, one man said. Its like people have forgotten history. How did Hitler come to power? He started out as a nice guy looking out for the working class. And a researcher found that in Germany, YouTubes recommendation system had steered viewers to fringe and conspiracy videos on a neo-Nazi demonstration. Activists say this may have contributed to a flood of misinformation, helping extremists shape public perceptions even after they had been run off the streets. _____ 9. Good news for late risers in California: The school day could start a little later. Gov. Jerry Brown is weighing a bill that would push back many schools start time to 8:30 a.m., a change that some say could go a long way toward helping students learn. This weeks Magazine is devoted to education, with stories about educators across the country who take second jobs to support themselves, a debate over what teachers can say in the classroom and a question of whether good teaching can be taught. _____ 10. Finally, this is your periodic reminder that its not all bad news out there. This is the Week in Good News, featuring environmentally friendly Legos, above; a flourishing newspaper that serves retirees; and digital Braille.

Will it matter? By Michelle Goldberg Opinion Columnist Obviously, I believe Christine Blasey Ford, the psychology professor who says that Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her in high school while his friend Mark Judge watched and, at moments, egged him on. I believe her when she says that Kavanaugh, who she says was drunk, held her down, covered her mouth when she tried to scream, and ground against her while attempting to pull her clothes off. I believe her when she says this incident haunted her all her life. Theres rarely hard evidence in a case like this, but Blasey  the surname she prefers to use publicly  has done everything possible to substantiate her claim. Speaking to The Washington Post, she produced notes from a therapist she saw in 2012, whom shed told about being attacked by students from an elitist boys school who grew up to become high-ranking members of society in Washington. According to her husband, that year she identified Kavanaugh to him by name. When Kavanaugh appeared on a shortlist of potential Supreme Court picks  but before his nomination had been announced  Blasey contacted both The Post and her member of Congress, Anna G. Eshoo of California. By all indications, she wanted to head his nomination off without being forced into the spotlight. Blasey passed a polygraph administered by a former F.B.I. agent. The utility of polygraphs is dubious, but her willingness to take one is evidence of her sincerity. According to Axios, some Republicans wanted to call on Blasey to testify publicly, assuming shed decline. But on Monday morning, Blaseys lawyer, Debra Katz, said that her client is willing to appear before Congress. Kavanaugh denies the allegation unequivocally; on Monday he said hes willing to rebut it before the Senate Judiciary Committee. (Judge, who wrote a memoir of his teenage alcoholism, has veered between denying the incident and saying he doesnt recall it.) But its a sign of how credible Blasey seems that, since this story broke, much of the public debate has been less about whether her accusations are true than whether they are relevant. Some conservatives  though not just conservatives  insist that it is unfair to judge a middle-aged man for things he did as a kid. On Fox News, the former George W. Bush press secretary Ari Fleischer pondered the weight of high school misbehavior. Should that deny us chances later in life? he asked. Even for Supreme Court job, a presidency of the United States, or you name it? Such arguments would be more convincing if people on the right werent so selective in their indulgence. Donald Trump called for the death penalty for the Central Park Five, who were 14 to 16 years old when they were arrested. (Theyve since been proven innocent.) Children are regularly put on sex offender registries, sometimes for their entire lives, for conduct less serious than what Kavanaugh is accused of. In a sour irony, some legal experts think Kavanaughs confirmation could imperil Miller v. Alabama, a 2012 decision banning life sentences without parole for most teenage convicts. Anyway, this is no longer just about what Kavanaugh might have done 36 years ago. We need to determine, as best we can, if hes lying now. The Judiciary Committee will be able to begin trying to do that at a public hearing next Monday  called by the committee's head, Charles Grassley, under pressure from some members of his own party. Senators should also demand that Kavanaughs old friend Judge, who grew up to become a right-wing writer, testify, though Kavanaugh would surely prefer other character witnesses. (Oh for the days when President George W. Bush gave his wife, Laura, a loving but firm pat on the backside in public, Judge once wrote. The man knew who was boss.) There is a small, dark part of me that thinks it would be fitting if Republicans shove Kavanaugh through despite the allegations against him. Anyone Trump nominates is going to threaten Roe v. Wade. Kavanaugh would at least make plain the power dynamics behind forced pregnancy. We would lose Roe because a president who boasted of sexual assault, elected against the wishes of the majority of female voters, was able to give a lifetime Supreme Court appointment to an ex-frat boy credibly accused of attempted rape. Kavanaugh, helped by an all-male Republican caucus on the Judiciary Committee, would join Clarence Thomas, whose confirmation hearing helped make the phrase sexual harassment a household term. They and three other men would likely vote against the courts three women. The brute imposition of patriarchy would be undeniable. If the Kavanaugh nomination is scuttled, chances are Republicans will try to replace him with someone like Amy Coney Barrett, who is in some ways more conservative. She would put a softer, female face on the culture war. But thats a fight for another day. On Sunday, Politico quoted a lawyer close to the White House as saying that the administration had redoubled its support for Kavanaugh in light of Blaseys claims: If somebody can be brought down by accusations like this, then you, me, every man certainly should be worried. If the Kavanaugh nomination goes forward, its because Trump and his allies believe that a certain class of men accused of sexual assault deserve impunity. The question now is whether any Republican senators believe otherwise. Michelle Goldberg has been an Opinion columnist since 2017. She is the author of several books about politics, religion and womens rights, and was part of a team that won a Pulitzer Prize for public service in 2018 for reporting on workplace sexual harassment issues.  @michelleinbklyn  Advertisement",Boys Will Be Supreme Court Justices,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/17/opinion/columnists/christine-blasey-ford-brett-kavanaugh-supreme-court-republicans.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/17/opinion/17goldbergWeb/17goldbergWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg,center

Heres the sign-up.) Good morning. Heres what you need to know: Judge Brett Kavanaughs nomination has come to symbolize Republicans yearning to shape the future of the federal judiciary. His confirmation hearings begin today, and you can keep up with developments here. A conservative stalwart who would replace the courts swing vote, Judge Kavanaugh, 53, would probably tilt the court to the right. We look at his likely role as a justice, and  where he stands on major issues.  Opponents will probably present the judge as a far-right extremist who would roll back abortion rights and protect President Trump from the threat of subpoena. Democrats have already protested the White Houses decision to withhold 100,000 pages of documents related to his work in the George W. Bush administration. Two easy wins now in doubt because there is not enough time. Good job Jeff. That was President Trumps latest salvo against his attorney general, criticizing the Justice Departments decision to bring criminal charges against two Republican congressmen before the midterm elections. In tying law enforcement decisions to Republicans chances to keep control of the House, Mr. Trump drew rebukes from former prosecutors and members of his own party.  Separately, we look at how the Justice Department has redefined decades of civil rights enforcement to focus on protecting people of faith, police officers and local government officials. The magazine decided to withdraw an invitation to President Trumps former chief strategist to speak at this years New Yorker Festival after several others said they would drop out in protest. I will not take part in an event that normalizes hate, the filmmaker Judd Apatow said. David Remnick, the magazines editor, initially defended Mr. Bannons participation, but he reconsidered after the withdrawals and a furor on social media.  Mr. Bannon called Mr. Remnick gutless. A looming assault on Idlib Province could deliver a decisive military blow against rebel fighters, prompting Western leaders to warn of an impending humanitarian calamity. Attacking the whole of Idlib to eliminate some radical groups would mean causing the death of hundreds of thousands of people and making 3.5 million people leave their homes one more time, Mevlut Cavusoglu, Turkeys foreign minister, said.  About 30,000 rebels are believed to be in the area, along with millions of noncombatants. A year after the storm, progress in Texas is unevenly distributed, leaving many minority and low-income residents struggling. Our Houston bureau chief and a photographer look at those left behind. A recent survey showed that 27 percent of Hispanic Texans whose homes were badly damaged reported that those homes remained unsafe to live in, compared with 20 percent of blacks and 11 percent of whites.

But in a broad reordering of the $3.5 trillion retail industry, the companies that learned how to match the instant gratification of e-commerce are capturing more gains.

As the country mourns the loss of Senator John McCain, theres a story from his past worth mentioning. A sensationalist Russian tabloid published a report in 2008 that purported to explain Mr. McCains antipathy to Russia. A government-funded Russian newspaper helped disseminate the story, in which Yuri Truschechkin, a former Soviet lieutenant colonel, said he had shot down Mr. McCains plane in North Vietnam in 1967. Mr. McCain spent more than five years as a prisoner of war. Mr. Truschechkin came forward, according to the report, after recognizing Mr. McCain during coverage of his presidential campaign. He always hated the Russians, Mr. Truschechkin said. He knew that it was our rocket that downed his plane. (Watch the video coverage.) Mr. Truschechkin, 70, had led a less than illustrious life, and was surviving on a pension of just over $450 a month. The story prompted some Russians to call for him to be honored. Just two months later, Russian newspapers reported that Mr. Truschechkin had died of cancer. He was said to have had just one question for Mr. McCain: whether he had finished reading the works of Karl Marx.

Fear, by the veteran journalist Bob Woodward, is the latest book to describe top officials working to undermine President Trumps impulses and privately insulting him. The anecdotes, gathered by nameless interviews with current and former officials, include Defense Secretary Jim Mattis comparing Mr. Trump to a fifth or sixth grader, and Gary Cohn, then the chief economic adviser, removing an important letter from the Oval Office desk so the president would forget to sign it. (According to the book, he did forget.) Mr. Trump accused Mr. Woodward of making up quotes and of running a con on the public.  Here are the books key takeaways and our review. Hiring the former N.F.L. quarterback who led player protests for an ad campaign is in line with decades of practice by a company that rarely shies away from politics.

One hundred years ago, the world was in the throes of World War I. The war weighed heavily on America, even on one of its favorite pastimes: baseball. A work or fight order for men in nonessential jobs was issued in July 1918, and the baseball season was cut short. On this day that year, the World Series began in Chicago. It was the earliest calendar date in the history of the series. And the game, between the Boston Red Sox and Chicago Cubs, provided another first. As the small crowd stood for the seventh-inning stretch, the military band began to play The Star-Spangled Banner. Red Sox third baseman Fred Thomas, playing while on furlough from the Navy, stood at attention with a military salute. First the song was taken up by a few, then others joined, and when the final notes came, a great volume of melody rolled across the field, said a spirited Times report. The song was an outburst of patriotism which caused every mothers son in the stands to forget all about baseball. It was the first time the anthem was sung at a major American sporting event. The song was played for the rest of the series, and for many more games to come. Remy Tumin wrote todays Back Story. _____ Your Morning Briefing is published weekdays and updated all morning.

Thirty years of warfare over judicial nominations culminated on Tuesday in the chaotic beginning of Senate consideration of the nomination of Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, a tumultuous 90-minute first act that no one in the hearing room had ever seen before in decades of such events. Democrats on the typically staid, decorous committee immediately interrupted Senator Charles E. Grassley, the Iowa Republican who leads the panel, as he opened the proceedings. They sought to postpone the hearing, fuming over a Labor Day night dump of 42,000 pages of documents less than 24 hours before the committee would convene. Protesters, mostly women, shouted objections to Judge Kavanaugh and President Trump from the public seats throughout the day and were ejected by the Capitol Police. Republicans, many of them well acquainted with Judge Kavanaugh for years, seethed. Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Republican, lamented that the committee was being subjected to mob rule and that if the hearing room was a courtroom, the Democrats would be held in contempt. The nominee  and his family and friends  sat stoically absorbing the scene that must have been somewhat overwhelming. But it should not have been unexpected. Democrats, with little recourse for stopping the nomination under changes in Senate confirmation practices, were determined to make a loud show of resistance and deploy any available weapons, which at this stage amounted to lodging procedural objections, issuing vehement complaints and articulating fears about the decline of the Senates role in confirmations. Im just sorry to see the Senate Judiciary Committee descend this way, said Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont and a former chairman of the panel. Ive felt privileged to serve here under both Republican and Democratic leadership for over 40 years. This is not the Senate Judiciary Committee I saw when I came to the U.S. Senate. The intense clash came just days after a series of memorial services for Senator John McCain and a call to bipartisanship, but that sentiment was definitely not in attendance at the hearing. Republicans wryly noted that Democrats admitted they had conferred with Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, over the weekend about their hearing strategy. Senator Ben Sasse, Republican of Nebraska, said opponents were spouting drivel and deranged comments about Judge Kavanaugh. Republicans circulated their scorecard listing the number of Democratic interruptions (63) versus mentions of Judge Kavanaughs judicial opinions (just 12). Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, attributed the commotion to folks who want to run for president, who want their moment in the spotlight. Frankly, I wish we could drop all this nonsense, Mr. Hatch said. But Democrats were in no mood to drop their furious objections. Their central complaint is that Republicans have moved forward with the confirmation despite the fact that tens of thousands of documents from Judge Kavanaughs time in the White House have not been disclosed and that the National Archives was not given time to do its own traditional records review. Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois and longtime member of the panel, told Judge Kavanaugh that the lack of records amounts to a 35-month black hole in your White House career. To Democrats, the Kavanaugh timetable stands in stark  and infuriating  contrast to the Republican decision in 2016 to deny any hearing at all to Judge Merrick B. Garland, President Barack Obamas nominee to replace Justice Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court after his death. When Justice Scalia died, Republicans refused to even meet  even a meeting in their office  with President Obamas nominee and held the seat open for one year, said Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the senior Democrat on the panel. Now with a Republican in the White House, theyve changed their position. The majority rushed into this hearing and is refusing to even look at the nominees full record. Republicans responded that the real way to judge the nominees record was through his more than 300 opinions while on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, calling much of the material sought by Democrats irrelevant. Reviewing Judge Kavanaughs staff secretary documents would teach us nothing about his legal views, Mr. Grassley said. The hearing is presenting a formidable challenge to Mr. Grassley, who over his long career has sought to cultivate a reputation for fairness. Democrats appealed to that desire to be seen as equitable, even as they carefully criticized the way he is presiding over the Kavanaugh review. Sir, based upon your own principles, your own values, I call for at least to have a debate or a vote on these issues and not for us to rush through this process, said Senator Cory Booker, Democrat of New Jersey, who has worked closely with Mr. Grassley on criminal justice issues. At the same time, Mr. Grassley was pressed by his own Republican Party for giving Democrats too much latitude in making their case. But Mr. Grassley said he was willing to take as long as it might to move forward. Were going to be in session Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday until we get done this week, Mr. Grassley said. So however long people want to take, were going to not necessarily accommodate all obstruction, but if people got something to say, this chairmans going to let them say it. Democrats say their concerns about the nomination, the hearing and the way it was being conducted were only heightened by Mr. Trumps weekend tweet expressing unhappiness with the recent indictment of two House Republicans. They seem certain to press Judge Kavanaugh about the presidents view and his own on whether the president is above the law. As a former prosecutor, this is abhorrent to me, Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, said about the presidents tweet. Democrats know they have little chance of slowing, let alone stopping, the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh as Republicans seem solidly behind him. Senator Mazie K. Hirono, Democrat of Hawaii, admitted as much, saying that some battles are worth fighting despite the likely outcome. And Democrats appear quite ready to fight to the extent they can.

By Paul Krugman Opinion Columnist Activists in Maine opposed to the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court are trying to put pressure on Susan Collins, the states Republican senator. If Collins votes for Kavanaugh, they say, they will donate substantial sums to her opponent in the next election. Whatever you think of Kavanaugh, this is surely a legitimate tactic: Donors and activists try to influence politicians votes all the time, often by warning of adverse electoral consequences if the politicians make what the activists consider the wrong choice. Last year, for example, major Republican donors openly threatened to withhold contributions unless the party gave them a big tax cut. But now Collins, other Republicans and conservative activists are describing the pressure over Kavanaugh as bribery, extortion and blackmail. And some of those claiming that normal political activism is somehow illegitimate are the very same big donors who warned Republicans to pass tax cuts or else. Calling this about-face hypocrisy is fair, but feels inadequate. Were looking at something much bigger and more pervasive than mere hypocrisy: Were talking about bad faith on an epic scale. Bad faith is, by the way, a legal term, referring to entering into an agreement without the intention or means to fulfill it, or violating basic standards of honesty. In politics, it usually means pretending to be committed to principles you abandon the moment they become inconvenient. And bad faith in this sense pervades almost everything the modern G.O.P. says and does. The very process that brought Kavanaugh to the brink of a lifetime Supreme Court appointment was saturated in bad faith. Remember, Republicans wouldnt even give President Barack Obamas nominee a hearing, claiming that because Obama was late in his second term the process should wait, leaving a court seat vacant for more than a year, to let voters weigh in. Now theyre trying to ram Kavanaugh through in a matter of weeks, despite incomplete vetting of his legal record and major questions about his personal history. (Explosive sexual charges aside, will anyone ask about his huge personal debts?) Why the rush? Because theres a chance the G.O.P. will lose the Senate soon. That whole thing about letting the voters have their say was dishonest from the beginning. And there are many more examples. Remember when Paul Ryan posed as the ultimate guardian of fiscal responsibility, releasing manifestoes warning in dire terms of the crushing burden of debt? The moment Republicans found themselves in control of the White House, Ryan helped ram through a huge tax cut that will add $1.5 trillion to the deficit. Ryans hyperventilating about the deficit was focused mainly on social programs; in particular, he proposed large cuts to Medicare, converting it into a voucher program that would eventually receive far less money than the existing program. Some pundits praised his courage in making such a proposal. But now a political action committee tied to Ryan is running ads falsely accusing Democrats of  planning to cut Medicare. Wait, theres more. For years, Republicans tarred their opponents as unpatriotic. Remember the whole thing about Obama supposedly apologizing for America? Now we have a president who praises brutal foreign dictators and whose national security adviser and campaign chairman were both undisclosed foreign agents  and it doesnt seem to bother the G.O.P. at all. Oh, and lets not forget that Bill Clinton was impeached over a consensual affair, because Republicans insisted that the presidents personal behavior must be above reproach. Need I say more? And there are many, many more such stories. In fact, whats really hard is to come up with significant areas of politics or policy where Republicans are acting in good faith, where their deeds really correspond to the principles they claim to have. Offhand, I cant come up with any examples. Why has the G.O.P. become the party of bad faith? Mainly, I suspect, because its core policy agenda of cutting taxes on the rich while slashing social programs is deeply unpopular. So to win elections it must obscure its true policies  like the Republicans now claiming, falsely, that they want to protect Americans with pre-existing medical conditions  and constantly pretend to stand for things it doesnt actually care about, from fiscal probity to personal responsibility. The key thing to realize about the G.O.P.s near-total commitment to bad faith is that voters arent the only victims. Its true that many Trump supporters will get a rude shock if Republicans hold Congress, imagining that theyre making America great and losing their health care coverage instead. But bad faith takes a moral toll on Republican politicians, too. We keep seeing people who once appeared to have some sense of decency turn into abject apparatchiks. Remember when Lindsey Graham seemed to have some independent conscience? Is Susan Collins next? Instead of attacking those activists back in Maine, she should be thanking them, for giving her one last chance to save her political soul.

Shear, Adam Liptak and Sheryl Gay Stolberg WASHINGTON  Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh, President Trumps nominee to the Supreme Court, on Wednesday dodged direct questions about whether the Constitution would allow Mr. Trump to use the powers of the presidency to thwart the Russia collusion and obstruction investigations that are swirling around his administration. Testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee on a grueling second day of hearings, Judge Kavanaugh refused to say whether he believes Mr. Trump, as a sitting president, could be subpoenaed by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, to testify in the sprawling inquiry. Answering questions in public for the first time since his nomination, the judge also declined to say whether Mr. Trump could escape legal jeopardy by pardoning himself or his associates. Im not going to answer hypothetical questions of that sort, Judge Kavanaugh said, insisting that it would be inappropriate for a Supreme Court nominee to publicly offer views on issues that might come before the court once he is a justice. Judge Kavanaugh also declined to say he would disqualify himself from cases concerning Mr. Trump. In a hearing that began in the morning, stretched into the night, and seesawed between intense grilling by Democrats and fawning praise by Republicans, Judge Kavanaugh sought to present himself as an evenhanded arbiter of the law rather than a partisan ideologue driven by a desire to carry out a Republican policy agenda. He parried questions, without any obvious blunders, on matters ranging from abortion to gun rights to executive powers and arcane provisions of antitrust law. At least two more days of hearings remain, but absent a startling revelation, he appears headed to confirmation by the end of the month because Republicans remain largely united behind his nomination. But Judge Kavanaugh did little to win over Democrats. Speaking generally, he insisted that he would be an independent justice prepared to rule against the president who appointed him. No one is above the law in our constitutional system, he said. At the same time, he did not retreat from views offered in law review articles that revealed a robust conception of presidential power, views he said had been forged in large part by five years of service in the White House under President George W. Bush. Under attack from progressives and Democrats who say he will roll back abortion rights, Judge Kavanaugh said he believes that Roe v. Wade, the 1973 landmark Supreme Court case establishing a womans right to an abortion, was settled as a precedent of the Supreme Court, and as such, deserves respect from judges. But he did not say whether he believes Roe was correctly decided. But then he noted a subsequent case, the 1992 case of Planned Parenthood v. Casey, which narrowed the scope of Roe at the same time that it reaffirmed Roe as a precedent. Casey, which gave states the authority to regulate abortion so long as those regulations do not pose an undue burden on the woman, is precedent on precedent, he said. On that issue and others, Judge Kavanaugh repeatedly sought to demonstrate empathy, telling senators that when it comes to understanding the real-life implications of abortion, I dont live in a bubble. I understand. I live in the real world. He defended his dissent last year in Garza v. Hargan, in which he argued that the Trump administration should have been allowed to temporarily block an undocumented teenager from having an abortion while it sought to place her with a sponsor. He said he had followed Supreme Court precedents, even as he acknowledged that there was no directly applicable case. I did my level best in an emergency posture, Judge Kavanaugh said. He said that took the teenagers situation into account. I tried to recognize the real-world effects on her, he said. I said consider the circumstances. Shes a 17-year-old, by herself, in a foreign country. In a facility where shes detained. And she has no one to talk to. And shes pregnant. Now that is a difficult situation. Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, said Judge Kavanaugh had participated in an attempt to deny the teenager access to a constitutional right, placing her health at risk. [Have questions about the hearings? Submit them for our Supreme Court correspondent.] Protesters continued to interrupt the hearing, adding to the tension after an opening day on Tuesday in which dozens of people were arrested after loudly disrupting the proceedings. There were more arrests on Wednesday. One woman was led out of the hearing room shouting sham president, sham justice; another hollered, Youre gaslighting the American people, drowning out Judge Kavanaugh as he calmly carried on. Democratic senators angrily railed against a swiftly moving confirmation process, accusing Republicans on the committee of refusing to make public documents that they said call into question Judge Kavanaughs honesty about his past congressional testimony and his record as a political operative and a lawyer in the Bush White House. Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, raised two Bush-era scandals with Judge Kavanaugh, and he suggested that Bush White House emails in the Judiciary Committees possession may contradict testimony the nominee made more than a decade ago  if only they could be released publicly. One of the scandals was the disclosure in late 2003 and 2004 that a Republican Judiciary Committee staff member had infiltrated the Democrats confidential internal files about which of President George W. Bushs judicial nominees to try to block and with what tactics. The other was the disclosure that after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, the Bush administration had secretly ordered the National Security Agency to intercept Americans phone calls and emails without obtaining the judicial warrants seemingly required by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. At his appeals court confirmation hearing in 2006, Judge Kavanaugh  who had worked as an associate White House counsel in the Bush administration  told senators that he did not know anything about the infiltration of Senate Democrats files on judicial nomination fights or about the warrantless wiretapping program before they eventually became public. But Mr. Leahy indicated that documents marked committee confidential  and kept secret from the public  provide evidence that Judge Kavanaugh had contact with Manuel Miranda, then a Republican staff member on the Judiciary Committee, and had more involvement with the surveillance program than he had acknowledged. I am concerned because there is evidence that Mr. Miranda provided you with materials that were stolen from me, Mr. Leahy said. And that would contradict your prior testimony. It is also clear from public emails  and Im refraining from going into nonpublic ones  that you had reason to believe materials were obtained inappropriately at the time. Judge Kavanaugh insisted that everything he had testified to before was 100 percent accurate, but indicated that he was not sure what Mr. Leahy was referring to. With Democrats casting him as a partisan who was nominated by Mr. Trump only to protect the president, Judge Kavanaugh spent considerable time trying to demonstrate his independence. One case he cited to buttress his argument was notable: United States v. Nixon, the 1974 decision in which the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that President Richard M. Nixon had to comply with a subpoena seeking tapes of his conversations in the Oval Office. In 1999, Judge Kavanaugh mused aloud that maybe Nixon was wrongly decided. He made the statement soon after serving under Ken Starr, the independent counsel who investigated President Bill Clinton. Judge Kavanaughs allies have said he meant the statement as a critique of the legal strategy of Mr. Clintons lawyers. But on Wednesday, he called it one of the greatest moments because of the political pressures of the time. The courts stood up for judicial independence in a moment of national crisis, Judge Kavanaugh said, ranking the decision as one of the Supreme Courts greatest achievements. Judge Kavanaugh also sought to portray himself as an advocate for women. He described sexual harassment allegations against Alex Kozinski, a former federal appellate judge for whom he once clerked, as a gut punch for me, and said he knew nothing of the behavior. And he told the committee he has made aggressive effort to hire female clerks; 25 of his 48 clerks were women. Judge Kavanaugh sidestepped questions from Senator Cory Booker, Democrat of New Jersey, about his personal views on affirmative action and racial profiling, even as Mr. Booker said Judge Kavanaugh was hostile to affirmation action and open to racial profiling. But the judge defended his decision upholding South Carolinas voter identification law, arguing that he had taken the real-world effect into account and had forced the state to take steps to insure that the law did not impose an undue burden on black people. On gun rights, Judge Kavanaugh told the committee the Second Amendment protected the right of Americans to own semiautomatic rifles because they are in common use and not a dangerous and unusual weapon  a position he took in a much-publicized 2011 dissent, which he said was rooted in Supreme Court precedent. That prompted an outcry from Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the top Democrat on the judiciary panel. How do you reconcile what youve just said with the hundreds of school shootings using assault weapons that have taken place in recent history? she asked. Senator, of course the violence in the schools is something we all detest, the judge replied. But he added, As a judge my job, as I saw it, was to follow the Second Amendment opinion of the Supreme Court.

Kavanaugh spent a long day answering  and often failing to answer  questions about some of the most pressing issues that could reach the Supreme Court in the years ahead. Heres a look at three of them. By Adam Liptak Asked about the constitutional right to abortion, Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh talked instead about precedent. He described the Supreme Courts two key decisions: Roe v. Wade, the 1973 ruling that established a constitutional right to abortion, and Planned Parenthood v. Casey, the 1992 decision that reaffirmed the core of that right. Collectively, he said, the two decisions held that a woman has a constitutional right to obtain an abortion before viability subject to reasonable regulation by the state up to the point where that regulation constitutes an undue burden on the womans right to obtain an abortion. But that was description, not endorsement. He did suggest that the Roe decision may be a particularly secure precedent. Its not as if its just a run-of-the-mill case that was decided and never been reconsidered, he said. That makes Casey a precedent on precedent. Like earlier nominees, he recited the reasons offered in the Casey decision for leaving precedents undisturbed, including whether people have relied on the decisions, whether the decisions have proved workable as a practical matter and what impact overruling them would have on public perception of the Supreme Courts legitimacy. People rely on the decisions of the courts, and so reliance interests are critically important to consider as a matter of precedent, Judge Kavanaugh said. Precedent also reinforces the impartiality and independence of the judiciary, he said. The people need to know in this country that the judges are independent, and that were not making decisions based on policy views. But Judge Kavanaugh did not say whether he would be prepared to reconsider Roe, and he declined an invitation to agree with a statement from the Casey decision that the right to abortion allows women to participate equally in the economic and social life of the nation. He said instead that the right to abortion was settled as a precedent of the Supreme Court. That statement is less categorical than it appears at first blush. To call a decision settled law is not to say it is set in stone. Judge Kavanaugh expressed dismay about gun violence. But he defended a robust view of Second Amendment rights. He was asked about his 2011 dissent in a case that upheld a ban in Washington on so-called assault weapons. The case was a sequel to District of Columbia v. Heller, the 2008 Supreme Court decision that established a constitutional right to own handguns for self-defense in the home, striking down an earlier Washington law. The majority in the appeals court ruled that the later ban was constitutional. On Wednesday, Judge Kavanaugh explained that he dissented because Justice Antonin Scalias majority opinion in the 2008 decision required it. He acknowledged that Justice Scalia had said that many gun control laws were unaffected by the 2008 ruling. Nothing in our opinion, Justice Scalia wrote, should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms. Judge Kavanaugh also said that the 2008 decision allowed machine guns to be prohibited, along with dangerous and unusual weapons. But he said semiautomatic weapons presented a different question. Most handguns are semiautomatic  something not everyone appreciates, Judge Kavanaugh said on Wednesday. Similarly, he said, semiautomatic rifles are widely possessed in the United States. I have to follow the precedent of the Supreme Court as its written, and thats what I tried to do in that case, he said. Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, asked Judge Kavanaugh about the practical impact of his position in light of recent school shootings. He responded that school officials have taken steps to protect students. Senator, he said, of course the violence in the schools is something we all detest and want to do something about, and there are lots of efforts, I know, underway to make schools safer. I know at my girls school they do a lot of things now that are different than they did just a few years ago in terms of trying to harden the school and make it safer for everyone. But as a judge my job, as I saw it, he said, was to follow the Second Amendment opinion of the Supreme Court whether I agreed with it or disagreed with it. Judge Kavanaugh made broad pronouncements on the independence of the judiciary, and he praised the Supreme Courts unanimous 1974 decision ordering President Richard M. Nixon to comply with a subpoena seeking tapes of his conversations in the Oval Office. It was one of the greatest moments because of the political pressures of the time, he said of the decision, United States v. Nixon. The courts stood up for judicial independence in a moment of national crisis. That ruling would, of course, figure in the resolution of any dispute between Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election, and President Trump. It was hard to escape the conclusion that Judge Kavanaugh was trying to assure senators that he might be prepared to rule against the president who nominated him, as Chief Justice Warren Burger did in the Nixon tapes case. But when Judge Kavanaugh was asked more specific questions about Mr. Trump, he declined to answer. Can a sitting president be required to respond to a subpoena? Ms. Feinstein asked. Judge Kavanaugh said that was a hypothetical question about what would be an elaboration or a difference from U.S. v. Nixons precise holding. I cant give you an answer on that hypothetical question, he said. He gave a similar answer to whether Mr. Trump could pardon himself. The question of self-pardons is something Ive never analyzed, he said. It is a question that Ive not written about. It is a question therefore that is a hypothetical question that I cant begin to answer in this context as a sitting judge and as a nominee to the Supreme Court.

Kavanaugh are set to emerge on Tuesday when he appears on Capitol Hill for the opening of his Supreme Court confirmation hearings. One is a champion for women; the other a threat to womens rights. Republicans will present Judge Kavanaugh to the nation as an experienced, independent-minded jurist with a sparkling rsum, and as an advocate and mentor for women in the judiciary. Among the cases they will cite: his 2009 ruling in favor of Emilys List, the group that backs Democratic women who support abortion rights. Democrats will tell an entirely different story, painting Judge Kavanaugh as a far-right extremist who would roll back abortion rights, deny health coverage to people with pre-existing conditions, protect President Trump from the threat of subpoena  and as someone who may have misled Congress when he testified during his appeals court confirmation hearing in 2006. Those two competing narratives will define the contours of a deeply partisan and immensely consequential battle over Mr. Trumps Supreme Court nominee. But while Democrats vowed early on to scuttle the Kavanaugh nomination  Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader, promised to oppose him with everything Ive got  they are unlikely to find success. Democrats have been unable to muster much public outrage over his nomination or Republicans refusal to grant them full access to documents from Judge Kavanaughs time working for former President George W. Bush. Even the Trump White Houses decision over the weekend to keep 100,000 pages secret produced little blowback. On Monday night, just 13 hours before the hearings were to begin, lawyers for Mr. Bush gave the Senate 42,000 pages of confidential documents, prompting an irate Mr. Schumer to call the document production process absurd, on Twitter, adding, Not a single senator will be able to review these records before tomorrow. Democrats also fell flat in their effort to delay the hearings after Mr. Trumps former lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, implicated the president in a hush-money scheme to influence the 2016 election. Judge Kavanaugh, 53, has spent the past 12 years on the federal appeals court here  a traditional steppingstone to the Supreme Court. If he is confirmed, he will shape the course of American jurisprudence for generations to come, filling the seat long occupied by the retired Justice Anthony M. Kennedy  a critical swing vote on divisive matters like same-sex marriage and abortion  with a committed conservative who would push a rightward-leaning court even further in that direction. The stakes are so high, said Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut and a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Were talking about a vote on the United States Supreme Court that could well decide whether women can decide when they want to have children, and whether Americans can decide whom they want to marry. But Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the Judiciary Committee chairman, argued in an interview Monday that it was folly to try to predict how Judge Kavanaugh might vote on any given matter. How do I know what hes going to rule on 10 years from now? Mr. Grassley asked. All I want is somebody thats going to interpret the Constitution strictly and leave legislating to the Congress of the United States, and I think hes the sort of guy who will do that. The hearings will play out for the next four days before the judiciary panel, with opening statements on Tuesday by senators and Judge Kavanaugh, followed by two days of questioning and a final day of testimony from outside witnesses. As Mr. Blumenthal, perhaps in a moment of understatement, predicted, Sparks will fly. Judge Kavanaughs views on reproductive rights and Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 case legalizing abortion, will take center stage. In addition to demanding to know whether he believes the case was correctly decided  a question he is all but certain to refuse to answer  Democrats will question him aggressively about his dissent in the case of Garza v. Hargan, in which he argued that a 17-year-old undocumented immigrant should not be permitted to have an immediate abortion. They have called Rochelle Garza, the girls lawyer, as a witness. And in this era of #MeToo, Democrats also plan to raise pointed questions about Judge Kavanaughs views on sexual harassment. Senator Mazie Hirono, Democrat of Hawaii, plans to ask Judge Kavanaugh if he has ever sexually harassed anyone  a question she said she asks of all nominees  and will also ask him about a judge for whom he clerked, Alex Kozinski, who abruptly retired last year from the federal appeals court amid harassment allegations. Republicans intend to push back by highlighting Judge Kavanaughs record of hiring female clerks  25 of his 48 clerks have been women  and by making the case that he has taken pains to mentor women. Among those who will formally introduce him on Tuesday are Condoleezza Rice, the former secretary of state, and Lisa S. Blatt, a self-described liberal Democrat and feminist lawyer who has advocated Judge Kavanaughs confirmation. We want to lay the groundwork to show that this has been a judge who is empowering and mentoring women, said one Senate Republican aide, speaking anonymously to discuss strategy. Judge Kavanaugh has expressed strong support for executive power, hostility to administrative agencies, and support for religious freedom and for gun rights. Democrats will press him on all of these topics, but are expected to drill especially deeply into his assertion, in a 2009 Minnesota Law Review article, that sitting presidents should be excused from some of the burdens of ordinary citizenship, including responding to civil and criminal lawsuits. Those comments are especially relevant in light of the special counsel investigation being led by Robert S. Mueller III. Democrats want Judge Kavanaugh to commit to recusing himself from ruling on matters involving that inquiry  a commitment he will undoubtedly avoid making. But perhaps the most blistering accusation Democrats will levy is that Judge Kavanaugh was untruthful during his 2006 testimony, when he told the judiciary panel that he was not involved in the questions about the rules governing the treatment of terror suspects. A White House spokesman, Raj Shah, has said the testimony accurately reflected the facts. An email, recently made public as part of a trove of Bush records, shows that while working in the Bush White House Counsels Office, the future judge volunteered to prepare a senior Bush administration official to testify about the governments monitoring of conversations between certain terrorism suspects and their lawyers. Democrats, led by Senators Richard J. Durbin of Illinois and Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, had questioned Judge Kavanaughs veracity even before that emails release. In an interview, Mr. Leahy drew a comparison between Judge Kavanaugh and Judge Jay S. Bybee, who was confirmed to the federal appeals court in 2003  years before the release of memos showing that, as head of the Justice Departments Office of Legal Counsel, he had given the C.I.A. its first detailed legal approval for waterboarding and other harsh interrogation techniques. Had that come out before the confirmation, Mr. Leahy said, I doubt very much that he would have been confirmed. In a narrowly divided Senate  50 Republicans, 47 Democrats and two independents who caucus with Democrats  the Kavanaugh nomination could be defeated if all Democrats hang together and one Republican votes no. But two Republicans most likely to cross the aisle, Senators Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine, both supporters of abortion rights, have made favorable comments about Judge Kavanaugh. And at least three Democrats  Joe Donnelly of Indiana, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Joe Manchin III of West Virginia  are facing re-election in states won by Mr. Trump and are under intense pressure to vote in favor. None of those senators are on the Judiciary Committee. Supreme Court confirmation hearings are always as much about political theater as they are about substance, and Judge Kavanaughs will be no exception. Several Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee  Cory Booker of New Jersey, Kamala Harris of California and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota  are possible 2020 presidential aspirants and will no doubt take advantage of the free national television exposure. Judge Kavanaugh, too, will take advantage of that limelight. In the nearly two months since Mr. Trump nominated him, he has been a silent presence in Washington, traipsing through the corridors of the Capitol complex, trailed by a retinue of security officers and advisers, as he made the customary courtesy visits to senators. Now he will have a chance to speak for himself, spotlighting his academic pedigree  he has undergraduate and law degrees from Yale  and addressing questions not only about his judicial record, but also the more contentious aspects of his rsum, including his days working for Kenneth W. Starr, the independent counsel who investigated former President Bill Clinton. While there, he urged prosecutors to pose graphic questions to Mr. Clinton about his relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky  a history that Democrats will invoke as they try to cast Judge Kavanaugh as a partisan political operative. Will the real Brett Kavanaugh please stand up? said Carrie Severino, chief counsel and policy director of the Judicial Crisis Network, a conservative advocacy group. You hear very contrasting views. This is a chance for people to see who is telling the truth about Judge Kavanaugh, and what is just spin.

Schmidt WASHINGTON  A secretive letter shared with senators and federal investigators by the senior Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee charges that a teenage Brett M. Kavanaugh and a male friend trapped a teenage girl in a bedroom during a party and tried to assault her, according to three people familiar with the contents of the letter. The letter says that Mr. Kavanaugh, then a student at Georgetown Preparatory School in suburban Washington and now President Trumps Supreme Court nominee, had been drinking at a social gathering when he and the male friend took the teenage girl into a bedroom. The door was locked, and she was thrown onto the bed. Mr. Kavanaugh then got on top of the teenager and put a hand over her mouth, as the music was turned up, according to the account. But the young woman was able to extricate herself and leave the room before anything else occurred, the letter says. The woman says she considered the episode an assault. She has declined to be publicly identified, and she asked Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, not to publicize the letter. In a statement shared by the White House, Mr. Kavanaugh said the charges were false. I categorically and unequivocally deny this allegation, he said. I did not do this back in high school or at any time. The friend who is said to have participated, Mark Judge, also denied the episode ever happened. I never saw anything like what was described, he said in an interview after being informed that he was named in the letter. Further, he said, it did not match Mr. Kavanaughs character: It is not who he is. He said that the two were around each other constantly in high school, and recalled him as a brilliant student, who was very into sports, and was not into anything crazy or illegal. Mr. Judge, an author, filmmaker and journalist who has written for the conservative Daily Caller and The Weekly Standard, said that the students were raised in Catholic homes and taught that the kind of behavior as described in the letter would not be tolerated. Something like that would stick out, he said, which is why I dont think it would happen. The episode took place more than 30 years ago, when all three individuals involved were minors. The New York Times has not seen the letter, but its contents were described by the three people. With speculation about the letters contents circulating this week, Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the Republican chairman of the Judiciary Committee, released a different letter on Friday, sent to him and Ms. Feinstein and signed by 65 women who say they knew Judge Kavanaugh while in high school. Through the more than 35 years we have known him, Brett has stood out for his friendship, character and integrity, the women wrote. In particular, he has always treated women with decency and respect. That was true when he was in high school, and it has remained true to this day. Mr. Grassley was still planning to move ahead with Mr. Kavanaughs confirmation. The Judiciary Committee is scheduled to hold a key vote to advance the nomination next Thursday, and Republican leaders hope to hold a final vote of the full Senate before the end of September to allow Mr. Kavanaugh to be seated before the start of the Supreme Courts fall term next month. Mr. Grassleys aides said that Mr. Kavanaugh had been the subject of six F.B.I. background checks since 1993, and none had turned up anything like the episode in question. It was not immediately clear how, if at all, the charges would influence senators who must decide whether to give Mr. Kavanaugh a lifetime appointment to the court. Only a small group of moderate senators remain publicly undecided about their votes, and objections from either one of two undecided Republicans, Senators Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, could thwart confirmation. Ms. Collins spent an hour on the phone with Mr. Kavanaugh on Friday, shortly after details of the letter were first published. The call had been scheduled for days, and neither the White House nor Ms. Collinss office would disclose what was discussed. The White House and outside pro-Kavanaugh groups continued to accuse Democrats of playing dirty, withholding mysterious information until the eve of Judge Kavanaughs confirmation in a last-ditch effort to derail a nominee they have always opposed. I do not intend to allow Judge Kavanaughs confirmation to be stalled because of an 11th-hour accusation that Democrats did not see fit to raise for over a month, Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, said on Friday. He added: The claims are wholly unverifiable, and come at the tail end of a process that was already marred by ugly innuendo, dishonesty and the nastiest form of our politics. The American people deserve much better from the Senate as an institution. Tom Mentzer, a spokesman for Ms. Feinstein, released a statement Friday afternoon that said, Senator Feinstein was given information about Judge Kavanaugh through a third party. The senator took these allegations seriously and believed they should be public, the statement continued. However, the woman in question made it clear she did not want this information to be public. It is critical in matters of sexual misconduct to protect the identity of the victim when they wish to remain anonymous, and the senator did so in this case. The womans letter first arrived on Capitol Hill in July, initially to the office of Representative Anna Eshoo, Democrat of California. It was quickly shared with Ms. Feinstein, as well, who from her senior position on the Judiciary Committee would lead Democratic questioning of Judge Kavanaugh. But Ms. Feinstein was torn by competing concerns. The woman made clear that though she had shared the information because she felt it could be relevant to Senate consideration of Judge Kavanaugh, she did not want to come forward or make the accusations public. For weeks, the letter and its contents were closely limited to a tight circle of aides. Ms. Feinstein chose not to raise the matter either publicly or privately during hourslong questioning of Judge Kavanaugh by senators last week, or in written questions sent to the nominee afterward and she did not initially share it with colleagues, including Mr. Grassley. By the time Judge Kavanaugh was on the witness stand, though, its existence had become an open secret on Capitol Hill, with speculation circling among reporters, lawmakers and congressional aides about its contents. The Intercept first reported its existence Wednesday evening. Under pressure from other Democratic senators, who had been fighting a pitched battle against Judge Kavanaugh for weeks  largely over access to documents from his years in the George W. Bush White House  Ms. Feinstein called a meeting late Wednesday to share with the lawmakers the letters contents but not the letter itself. Several of those senators advised Ms. Feinstein to at least share the letter with law enforcement authorities. On Thursday, she announced in a cryptic statement that she had sent information from an individual concerning the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court to the authorities, but only after redacting the womans name from the document. Others wanted to take a more aggressive tack and push what they saw as serious accusations into public view, despite the womans concerns, Senate officials familiar with the matter said. Ms. Feinsteins statement appears to have been an attempt to account for both demands. The F.B.I. has not opened a criminal investigation into the matter, but added the letter to Judge Kavanaughs background file. That updated file was in turn shared with the White House on Thursday and then sent to Capitol Hill, where it will be kept in the office of the chairman for review by senators. Senators themselves had little to say publicly about the accusations on Friday. The new details seemed merely to harden the position of outside groups that have conducted an expensive war over the nominee, with at least one liberal group, NARAL Pro-Choice America, calling for Mr. Kavanaugh to withdraw his nomination. A womans identity should not have to be revealed to take her story seriously and pursue justice on her behalf, the groups president, Ilyse Hogue, said in a statement. The charge of sexual assault against Brett Kavanaugh is disqualifying and we call on him to immediately withdraw his nomination for the Supreme Court. Carrie Severino, chief counsel and policy director of the Judicial Crisis Network, the conservative group pressing for Judge Kavanaughs confirmation, drew the opposite conclusion, insisting there should be no delay in the confirmation process. This is nothing more than a last-minute attempt at character assassination, she said. Jodi Kantor, Steve Eder and Rebecca Ruiz contributed reporting from New York.

Kavanaugh, and the woman who has accused him of sexual assault before the committee on Monday for extraordinary public hearings only weeks before the midterm elections. In setting the hearing, Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, backed down from a committee vote on Judge Kavanaughs nomination, planned for this Thursday, and pushed a confirmation once seen as inevitable into limbo. The hearing with Judge Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, a research psychologist in Northern California, sets up a potentially explosive public showdown that carries unmistakable echoes of the 1991 testimony of Anita Hill, who accused the future Justice Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment in an episode that riveted the nation and ushered a slew of women into public office. It will play out against the backdrop of the #MeToo movement, which has energized Democratic women across the United States, in an institution, the Senate, that is more than three-quarters male. Mr. Trump vigorously defended his nominee on Monday, calling him an outstanding judge with an unblemished record, and dismissing as ridiculous the prospect that Judge Kavanaugh might withdraw his nomination. He is somebody very special; at the same time, we want to go through a process, we want to make sure everything is perfect, everything is just right, Mr. Trump told reporters at the White House. If it takes a little delay, it will take a little delay  it shouldnt certainly be very much. The announcement of Mondays hearing capped a tumultuous day in Washington, as senators of both parties absorbed the accusations against Judge Kavanaugh, who only last week seemed on a glide path toward confirmation. Dr. Blasey has said he sexually assaulted her at a social gathering in the 1980s when they were both teenagers. Judge Kavanaugh has categorically denied the accusations, which Dr. Blasey detailed in a letter sent in July to Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, who kept its existence secret until last week at Dr. Blaseys request. (She uses the surname Blasey professionally, though news accounts have also referred to her by her married name, Ford.) By Monday, both the contents of the letter and Dr. Blaseys identity had spilled out into the open, intensifying what had already been a nasty partisan battle over Judge Kavanaughs confirmation. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, angrily assailed Democrats for raising the accusations at the last minute. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, demanded the F.B.I. investigate, and raised questions about Judge Kavanaughs veracity. On Monday evening, The Mercury News in California published the accounts of two friends of Dr. Blaseys who said that she told them in July that she was going forward with her accusations. It will be up to Judge Kavanaugh to convince wavering senators of his innocence. Both Senators Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, and Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, said Monday that if true, Dr. Blaseys accusations would disqualify the nominee from the Supreme Court. Obviously, if Judge Kavanaugh has lied about what happened, that would be disqualifying, Ms. Collins told reporters, adding, For my part, I believe that its very important that both Professor Ford and Judge Kavanaugh testify under oath about these allegations. I need to see them and listen to their answers to the questions in order to make an assessment. Mr. Flake told reporters that he is presupposing nothing with this hearing, but added, If you believe the charges are true, you vote no. Washingtons advocacy machinery also sprang to life. A conservative advocacy group said that it would spend $1.5 million on a television advertising campaign to defend Judge Kavanaugh, while a liberal group announced a $700,000 ad buy intended to pressure senators in swing states. Allies of Judge Kavanaugh made public letters from two former girlfriends, attesting to his character, while a hashtag sprang up on Twitter: #BelieveChristine. Judge Kavanaugh spent the day at the White House, huddling and strategizing with aides in a war room across from the West Wing from which they had meticulously planned his path to confirmation. On Monday, though, the discussions were about how to salvage his chances through a hearing that officials were resigned to becoming a dramatic public spectacle. Eager to defend himself from an accusation he insisted was untrue, Judge Kavanaugh had wanted to put out a statement over the weekend signaling his willingness to address the charge with the committee, according to allies and an administration official who insisted on anonymity to characterize his thinking. But Donald F. McGahn II, the White House counsel, and others urged Judge Kavanaugh to hold back until they had a chance to determine how seriously the accusation was being taken. They believed there might be a chance that, working with Mr. McConnell and Republicans on the Judiciary Committee, they could push past the accusation of a decades-old episode and handle it privately while keeping a Thursday vote on track. By Monday morning, however, with Dr. Blaseys lawyer saying Dr. Blasey was willing to appear in front of Congress, Mr. McGahn and others changed course and agreed that Judge Kavanaugh should put out his statement. I have never done anything like what the accuser describes  to her or to anyone, the statement said. Because this never happened, I had no idea who was making this accusation until she identified herself yesterday. On Capitol Hill on Monday, Mr. Grassley and Mr. McConnell initially resisted calls for hearings, and instead arranged telephone calls to allow Republican and Democratic aides to interview both Judge Kavanaugh and Dr. Blasey  a plan that Mr. Schumer rejected as a biased, far-fetched process. But by days end, Republican leaders concluded that it would be necessary to move forward to satisfy the concerns of senators in both parties. Still, there were other Republicans who feared the committee had made a dangerous misstep in agreeing so quickly to a public hearing. Without having fully deposed either Dr. Blasey or Judge Kavanaugh, these Republicans fear that the party and the White House could unexpectedly and irrevocably lose control of the nomination when the witnesses take the stand. Ms. Feinstein, meanwhile, accused Republicans of rushing into the hearing to block an investigation into Dr. Blaseys accusations. Im disappointed the F.B.I. and White House are failing to take even the most basic steps to investigate this matter, she said in a statement issued late Monday. Both in the letter to Ms. Feinstein and in an interview published Sunday by The Washington Post, Dr. Blasey said that during a gathering of teenagers at a private home in suburban Montgomery County, Md., the future Judge Kavanaugh, along with a friend, pushed her into a bedroom as she was making her way to a bathroom. She said the young Mr. Kavanaugh jumped on top of her, grinding his body against hers as he tried to remove her clothing. When she tried to scream, she said, he clapped his hand over her mouth to muffle the cries. They both laughed as Kavanaugh tried to disrobe me in their highly inebriated state, she wrote in the letter, made public Monday by CNN. With Kavanaughs hand over my mouth I feared he may inadvertently kill me. Her lawyer, Debra Katz, said in an interview that Dr. Blasey was ready to go before the committee. We hope that this hearing is fair and not another weaponized attack on a woman who has come forward with allegations of sexual misconduct against a powerful man, Ms. Katz said. Public hearings could be charged, especially in a political year marked by rising female political activism and a surge of female candidates. No Republican women serve on the Judiciary Committee, and senior Republican men appeared ready to defend the nominee. I believe him, Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, who serves on the Judiciary Committee, told reporters after a private phone call with Mr. Kavanaugh on Monday afternoon. Mr. Hatch said he saw lots of reasons not to believe Dr. Blaseys accusation. He is a person of immense integrity, the senator said. I have known him for a long time. He has always been straightforward, honest, truthful and a very, very decent man. Ms. Feinstein came in for particular criticism from Republicans who took shots at her for withholding the information about Dr. Blasey until last week. If they believe Judge Kavanaughs accuser, why didnt they surface this information earlier so that he could be questioned about it? Mr. McConnell asked. And if they didnt believe her and chose to withhold the information, why did they decide at the 11th hour to release it? Ms. Katz said Ms. Feinstein withheld the letter because she was respecting Dr. Blaseys wishes to remain private. Ultimately, after rumors of the letter circulated on Capitol Hill, and she was confronted by Democratic colleagues on the Judiciary Committee, Ms. Feinstein referred the letter to the F.B.I. Asked why she had waited so long, the senator hesitated. I dont know; Ill have to look back and see, Ms. Feinstein told reporters, before ducking into the Senate chamber. When she emerged, she said, The answer is that she asked that it be confidential. Nicholas Fandos, Catie Edmondson and Eileen Sullivan contributed reporting.

By Ross Douthat Opinion Columnist While on the surface it is the embryos fate that seems to be at stake, the sociologist Kristin Luker wrote in 1984, the abortion debate is actually about the meaning of womens lives. This line, from Lukers book Abortion and the Politics of Motherhood, neatly encapsulates a longstanding pro-choice charge against the pro-life movement. As much as opponents of abortion claim to care about the killing of the unborn, the argument goes, in reality abortion restriction is a means to a different end: The restraint of womens choices, the restriction of their sexual freedom, their subordination to the rule of fathers and husbands and patriarchy writ large. The reality has always been more complicated. From the beginning of the modern anti-abortion movement  whose origins lie in the 1960s, not just the aftermath of Roe v. Wade  it has included female leaders who identify as pro-life feminists and reject the idea that female liberty depends on a right to kill your unborn child. And while the pro-life grass roots tended to be strongly traditionalist on gender roles in the 1970s, with time pro-life and pro-choice citizens converged in their views on womens roles; by the late 2000s, the Claremont McKenna professor Jon Shields wrote in a 2012 commentary on Lukers book, a clear majority of pro-lifers voters held views that sociologists would describe as gender egalitarian, not traditionalist or Gileadean. At the same time the abortion-rights movement was linked in its early days to a distinctive form of upper-class WASP paternalism  in which legal abortion was sold as a means of helping upper-class good girls out of trouble while keeping the undesirable fertility of other classes and races in check. And from Hugh Hefners early abortion-rights advocacy to a certain style of predatory male feminism today, support for legal abortion among men has often carried a strong whiff of self-interest, with feticide as a get-out-of-responsibility-free card for caddish men. But with all this said, its also obvious that social conservatism can lapse into a version of Lukers portrait, and its easy to think of examples  the Todd Akin fiasco of 2012, for instance  where a cruelly sexist form of anti-abortion politics reared an ugly head. Which is why the allegation of sexual assault against Brett Kavanaugh represents a uniquely dangerous moment for a pro-life movement that has spent decades working toward the goal of a fifth Supreme Court vote to amend or overturn Roe v. Wade.  Kavanaugh may be innocent. The allegation against him is plausible but not nearly as dispositive as the cascade of #MeToo claims that have felled other prominent men. If it is false, the work of a faulty or disoriented memory, then he is in a legitimately terrible position, with a lifetimes reputation for probity at stake and no clear way to clear his name. Which is why the accuser cannot shirk testifying publicly, as her lawyer suggested last night, and expect her claims to keep him from the Supreme Court. But she may testify, and her story may be true. And it has landed at a moment of great cultural peril for a type of social conservatism that regards itself as idealistic and pro-woman and capable of marrying its convictions to support for female advancement and empowerment. In its targets the #MeToo movement has made no partisan distinctions; if anything, it has probably ended the careers of more prominent liberal pigs than right-wing men. But for reasons of political expedience, conservatives have been more likely to make excuses for their predators, and indeed have elevated one of the more prominent examples to the White House. That elevation, and the Trumpification of the right it has required, has accelerated the political polarization of the sexes, so that what was once a milder gender gap is now an extraordinary gulf. Thanks to Trump and his enablers, then, liberals and the Democratic Party have been able to take the long list of Hollywood creeps and Acela-corridor bounders and say, look, we have a problem, but were dealing with it. While conservatives and the Republican Party are stuck as the vehicle for male defensiveness and anti-#MeToo backlash. Which, to be clear, sometimes has a point. False rape accusations against privileged-white-male targets (the Duke lacrosse team, the imaginary Haven Monahan at the University of Virginia) are real enough, and the style of anti-rape policies on college campuses really has gone too far in traducing the rights of accused men. But among men who are legitimately prominent, not just unfortunate collegians, there have been few cases of late where the accusations have seemed trumped-up or the punishment too severe. The plight of Louis C.K. or Charlie Rose inspires no sympathy, and the attempts at reflection and self-rehabilitation by various fallen men  John Hockenberry in Harpers, Jian Ghomeshi in The New York Review of Books  have mostly been obtuse. And the fact that Ronan Farrow can claim a legitimate scalp every month suggests that the has it gone too far? plaints are still premature. A Trumpified conservatism, though, will necessarily struggle to acknowledge any of this, because of what it would suggest about Trumps own fitness for his office. And such a conservatism  much-more-heavily male than the Reagan or Bush G.O.P., organized around the fears and grievances of prominent men, and seemingly indifferent to the legitimacy of certain kinds of female anger  will end up defining all its constituent parts, all its causes and concerns, as subordinate to the defense of male impunity. This includes the pro-life movement. Even if it wins its long-desired victory at the high court and more anti-abortion legislation becomes possible, a pro-life cause joined to a party that cant win female votes and seems to have no time for women will never be able to achieve those legislative goals, or at least never outside a very few, very conservative states. And having that long-awaited victory accomplished by a male judicial appointee confirmed under a cloud of #MeToo suspicion seems like a good way to cement a perception thats fatal to the pro-life movements larger purposes  the perception that you cant be pro-woman and pro-life. This points to a conclusion thats certainly unfair to Kavanaugh if hes innocent, but nobody ever said that politics would be fair. If his accuser testifies publicly and credibly, if her allegation isnt undermined by a week of scrutiny and testimony, if it remains unprovable but squarely in the realm of plausibility, then all the abortion opponents who were supporting him should hope that his nomination is withdrawn  with, ideally, a woman nominated in his place. That would be a political gamble in its own right, of course, and one that the Trump White House will take only under duress. But if Kavanaugh is a qualified judge, no judicial nominee is indispensable. And for a movement that risked so much to make these nominations possible, there is no reason to compound that risk unless this nominee can find a way to decisively persuade the country, however unfair that burden may seem, that he did not treat Christine Blasey Ford with the cruelty alleged this week.

By Serena Mayeri Ms. Mayeri teaches law and history at the University of Pennsylvania Law School. Judge Brett Kavanaughs voluminous record, his opinion of the Supreme Courts landmark abortion ruling, Roe v. Wade, and his views on legal precedent have deservedly been scrutinized in the lead-up to his confirmation hearings next week. But the Supreme Courts 1992 decision in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, more than Roe, holds the key to understanding the stakes of Judge Kavanaughs potential confirmation.  It is Casey that now protects womens access to reproductive health care in states whose restrictions on health care providers and patients threaten to close clinics or ban abortions outright. And the political lesson conservatives learned from Casey all but guarantees that a vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote not only to endanger abortion rights but to turn back the clock on a century of progressive reforms. On the eve of the presidential election of 1992, the court seemed poised to reconsider Roe in a case challenging several Pennsylvania abortion restrictions. Abortion-rights advocates thought Roes demise certain. They worried most that the court might gut Roe without overruling it. A decision that openly reversed Roe might galvanize abortion-rights voters in November. But if women slowly lost the right to choose abortion, no electoral reckoning would follow.  The courts decision in Casey surprised everyone: Justices Anthony Kennedy, Sandra Day OConnor and David Souter co-authored an opinion that upheld the core holding of Roe but gave states more leeway to regulate abortion through informed consent requirements, waiting periods and other barriers. Instead of the strict scrutiny that doomed most restrictions under Roe, a more pliable undue burden standard would apply to abortion regulations.  Activists on both sides condemned the ruling, but Casey included something for everyone. The decision placed abortion rights on firmer constitutional footing by grounding them in womens dignity and equality. Women, the court said, needed reproductive choice to determine their individual destinies and to participate fully in the economic and social life of the nation. At the same time, Casey upheld states interest in protecting potential life, approving all but one of the challenged Pennsylvania regulations. As abortion-rights leaders feared, Caseys undue burden standard allowed more restrictions than Roe. Many states have enacted laws that drastically limit access to reproductive health care, particularly for poor, rural and immigrant women who cannot afford to miss work and make repeated trips to clinics hundreds of miles away. But in 2016, Justice Kennedy provided the crucial vote to strike down, under Casey, a Texas law that shuttered half the states clinics by imposing excessively burdensome requirements on them.  For anti-abortion activists, Casey confirmed the paramount importance of judicial appointments. Caseys co-authors were all Republican appointees. Anti-abortion conservatives vowed that never again would they allow a Republican president to squander Supreme Court nominations on unreliable judges.  Abortion opponents, like their adversaries, recognize the potential for electoral backlash if the court reverses Roe outright. Many would prefer abortion rights to die gradually and quietly. Merely by interpreting Casey to allow increasingly restrictive laws, the Supreme Court can stealthily smother choice without appearing to deliver a death blow. Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, said this summer that she could not support a nominee who had demonstrated hostility to Roe or to established precedent. Judge Kavanaugh reportedly told Ms. Collins recently that he considered Roe to be settled law. These statements should reassure no one. Casey, not Roe, is the established precedent that matters here. And it seems more likely that abortion rights will die a death by a thousand cuts through restrictive state laws allowed under Casey than by a reversal of Roe. Either way, a vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to diminish reproductive freedom.  It is also a vote to advance a larger agenda. Over several decades, the conservative legal movement has linked opposition to reproductive choice with constitutional theories that enhance the rights of corporations at the expense of human beings. Conservatives have tethered the anti-abortion cause to a selective libertarianism that opposes government regulation of business but authorizes expansive executive power and state intrusion on individual liberties. Judge Kavanaugh would not have passed Federalist Society muster if he did not demonstrate allegiance to these principles. With this confirmation vote, then, much more than abortion rights hangs in the balance. So does the countrys ability to fight voter suppression, political corruption and racial intimidation; to protect clean air and water; to ensure safety for workers and consumers; to combat climate change; to enact sensible gun laws; to voluntarily integrate public schools; to provide necessary health care and preserve a basic social safety net; to protect civil rights and liberties; and to safeguard the integrity of all families.  Americans who put aside their qualms and voted for the president to secure Supreme Court justices who would end legal abortion may pay a high price for their choice. With one more justice, Mr. Trumps Republican Party will fully control all three branches of government, eliminating the last check on his power. It matters little, therefore, what Judge Kavanaugh says to senators about Roe or settled law. Conservatives have learned the lessons of Casey too well to permit the appointment of another justice in the Anthony Kennedy mold. And abortion rights are one of many inevitable casualties of this appointment. Senators who vote yes will bear responsibility for all of them.

Kavanaugh, and the woman who has accused him of sexual assault before the committee on Monday for extraordinary public hearings only weeks before the midterm elections. In setting the hearing, Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, backed down from a committee vote on Judge Kavanaughs nomination, planned for this Thursday, and pushed a confirmation once seen as inevitable into limbo. The hearing with Judge Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, a research psychologist in Northern California, sets up a potentially explosive public showdown that carries unmistakable echoes of the 1991 testimony of Anita Hill, who accused the future Justice Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment in an episode that riveted the nation and ushered a slew of women into public office. It will play out against the backdrop of the #MeToo movement, which has energized Democratic women across the United States, in an institution, the Senate, that is more than three-quarters male. Mr. Trump vigorously defended his nominee on Monday, calling him an outstanding judge with an unblemished record, and dismissing as ridiculous the prospect that Judge Kavanaugh might withdraw his nomination. He is somebody very special; at the same time, we want to go through a process, we want to make sure everything is perfect, everything is just right, Mr. Trump told reporters at the White House. If it takes a little delay, it will take a little delay  it shouldnt certainly be very much. The announcement of Mondays hearing capped a tumultuous day in Washington, as senators of both parties absorbed the accusations against Judge Kavanaugh, who only last week seemed on a glide path toward confirmation. Dr. Blasey has said he sexually assaulted her at a social gathering in the 1980s when they were both teenagers. Judge Kavanaugh has categorically denied the accusations, which Dr. Blasey detailed in a letter sent in July to Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, who kept its existence secret until last week at Dr. Blaseys request. (She uses the surname Blasey professionally, though news accounts have also referred to her by her married name, Ford.) By Monday, both the contents of the letter and Dr. Blaseys identity had spilled out into the open, intensifying what had already been a nasty partisan battle over Judge Kavanaughs confirmation. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, angrily assailed Democrats for raising the accusations at the last minute. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, demanded the F.B.I. investigate, and raised questions about Judge Kavanaughs veracity. On Monday evening, The Mercury News in California published the accounts of two friends of Dr. Blaseys who said that she told them in July that she was going forward with her accusations. It will be up to Judge Kavanaugh to convince wavering senators of his innocence. Both Senators Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, and Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, said Monday that if true, Dr. Blaseys accusations would disqualify the nominee from the Supreme Court. Obviously, if Judge Kavanaugh has lied about what happened, that would be disqualifying, Ms. Collins told reporters, adding, For my part, I believe that its very important that both Professor Ford and Judge Kavanaugh testify under oath about these allegations. I need to see them and listen to their answers to the questions in order to make an assessment. Mr. Flake told reporters that he is presupposing nothing with this hearing, but added, If you believe the charges are true, you vote no. Washingtons advocacy machinery also sprang to life. A conservative advocacy group said that it would spend $1.5 million on a television advertising campaign to defend Judge Kavanaugh, while a liberal group announced a $700,000 ad buy intended to pressure senators in swing states. Allies of Judge Kavanaugh made public letters from two former girlfriends, attesting to his character, while a hashtag sprang up on Twitter: #BelieveChristine. Judge Kavanaugh spent the day at the White House, huddling and strategizing with aides in a war room across from the West Wing from which they had meticulously planned his path to confirmation. On Monday, though, the discussions were about how to salvage his chances through a hearing that officials were resigned to becoming a dramatic public spectacle. Eager to defend himself from an accusation he insisted was untrue, Judge Kavanaugh had wanted to put out a statement over the weekend signaling his willingness to address the charge with the committee, according to allies and an administration official who insisted on anonymity to characterize his thinking. But Donald F. McGahn II, the White House counsel, and others urged Judge Kavanaugh to hold back until they had a chance to determine how seriously the accusation was being taken. They believed there might be a chance that, working with Mr. McConnell and Republicans on the Judiciary Committee, they could push past the accusation of a decades-old episode and handle it privately while keeping a Thursday vote on track. By Monday morning, however, with Dr. Blaseys lawyer saying Dr. Blasey was willing to appear in front of Congress, Mr. McGahn and others changed course and agreed that Judge Kavanaugh should put out his statement. I have never done anything like what the accuser describes  to her or to anyone, the statement said. Because this never happened, I had no idea who was making this accusation until she identified herself yesterday. On Capitol Hill on Monday, Mr. Grassley and Mr. McConnell initially resisted calls for hearings, and instead arranged telephone calls to allow Republican and Democratic aides to interview both Judge Kavanaugh and Dr. Blasey  a plan that Mr. Schumer rejected as a biased, far-fetched process. But by days end, Republican leaders concluded that it would be necessary to move forward to satisfy the concerns of senators in both parties. Still, there were other Republicans who feared the committee had made a dangerous misstep in agreeing so quickly to a public hearing. Without having fully deposed either Dr. Blasey or Judge Kavanaugh, these Republicans fear that the party and the White House could unexpectedly and irrevocably lose control of the nomination when the witnesses take the stand. Ms. Feinstein, meanwhile, accused Republicans of rushing into the hearing to block an investigation into Dr. Blaseys accusations. Im disappointed the F.B.I. and White House are failing to take even the most basic steps to investigate this matter, she said in a statement issued late Monday. Both in the letter to Ms. Feinstein and in an interview published Sunday by The Washington Post, Dr. Blasey said that during a gathering of teenagers at a private home in suburban Montgomery County, Md., the future Judge Kavanaugh, along with a friend, pushed her into a bedroom as she was making her way to a bathroom. She said the young Mr. Kavanaugh jumped on top of her, grinding his body against hers as he tried to remove her clothing. When she tried to scream, she said, he clapped his hand over her mouth to muffle the cries. They both laughed as Kavanaugh tried to disrobe me in their highly inebriated state, she wrote in the letter, made public Monday by CNN. With Kavanaughs hand over my mouth I feared he may inadvertently kill me. Her lawyer, Debra Katz, said in an interview that Dr. Blasey was ready to go before the committee. We hope that this hearing is fair and not another weaponized attack on a woman who has come forward with allegations of sexual misconduct against a powerful man, Ms. Katz said. Public hearings could be charged, especially in a political year marked by rising female political activism and a surge of female candidates. No Republican women serve on the Judiciary Committee, and senior Republican men appeared ready to defend the nominee. I believe him, Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, who serves on the Judiciary Committee, told reporters after a private phone call with Mr. Kavanaugh on Monday afternoon. Mr. Hatch said he saw lots of reasons not to believe Dr. Blaseys accusation. He is a person of immense integrity, the senator said. I have known him for a long time. He has always been straightforward, honest, truthful and a very, very decent man. Ms. Feinstein came in for particular criticism from Republicans who took shots at her for withholding the information about Dr. Blasey until last week. If they believe Judge Kavanaughs accuser, why didnt they surface this information earlier so that he could be questioned about it? Mr. McConnell asked. And if they didnt believe her and chose to withhold the information, why did they decide at the 11th hour to release it? Ms. Katz said Ms. Feinstein withheld the letter because she was respecting Dr. Blaseys wishes to remain private. Ultimately, after rumors of the letter circulated on Capitol Hill, and she was confronted by Democratic colleagues on the Judiciary Committee, Ms. Feinstein referred the letter to the F.B.I. Asked why she had waited so long, the senator hesitated. I dont know; Ill have to look back and see, Ms. Feinstein told reporters, before ducking into the Senate chamber. When she emerged, she said, The answer is that she asked that it be confidential. Nicholas Fandos, Catie Edmondson and Eileen Sullivan contributed reporting.

Heres the sign-up.) Good morning. Heres what you need to know: Judge Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court nominee, and the woman who has accused him of sexual assault are scheduled to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee in a public hearing on Monday. The committee had planned to vote on Judge Kavanaughs nomination this Thursday, but a confirmation that once seemed inevitable is now in limbo. Christine Blasey Ford has said he sexually assaulted her at a party when they were teenagers in the 1980s. Judge Kavanaugh has denied the allegations.  Echoes of Anita Hill: The case has drawn comparisons to the 1991 testimony of Ms. Hill, who accused the future Justice Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment. Our correspondents in Washington traced the similarities and differences.  Opinion: In an Op-Ed for The Times, Ms. Hill argues that the Senate Judiciary Committee has a chance to do better by the country than when she testified nearly three decades ago. President Trump, emboldened by good economic news in the U.S., said on Monday that he would impose tariffs on an additional $200 billion worth of Chinese goods. Added to previous tariffs, the new levies would mean that nearly half of all Chinese imports into the U.S. will soon face extra fees. Mr. Trump also made clear he might go even further, taxing remaining Chinese imports if China takes retaliatory action against our farmers or other industries. The president has said that tariffs will save American factories, but history suggests otherwise, our correspondent writes.  The markets: The Chinese stock market opened at a four-year low today before rebounding, and other markets are largely shrugging off the trade news. Heres a snapshot of global exchanges today.  Also from the administration: Mr. Trump plans to cap the number of refugees who can resettle in the U.S. next year at 30,000, the lowest total for the refugee program since its creation in 1980. The Carolinas were struggling to cope with the effects of record rainfall as the remnants of Hurricane Florence moved out of the region. At least 31 deaths have been attributed to the storm. The hurricane has served as a reminder, as seen in New Orleans after Katrina, that low-income residents are particularly vulnerable. The flooding has also threatened Superfund sites, the hazardous-waste removal projects mandated by the federal government, as well as chemical plants and industrial hog farms.

Heres the sign-up.) Good morning. Heres what you need to know: A Senate hearing scheduled for Monday to review allegations of sexual assault by the Supreme Court nominee is now in doubt. Christine Blasey Ford, who has accused Judge Brett Kavanaugh of assaulting her at a high school party more than 30 years ago, said on Tuesday that she wanted the F.B.I. to investigate before she testifies. He has categorically denied her accusation. Republicans signaled that they would not postpone the hearing, and would either hold it without Dr. Blasey or declare it unnecessary if she refuses to appear. In a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee, Dr. Blaseys lawyers said she had been the target of vicious harassment and even death threats since her identity had been made public.  A national debate: The accusations are being assessed under different social and cultural conventions than when the assault is said to have occurred. Our reporter looks at what has changed. Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, has committed to some concrete steps toward denuclearization, but they fall far short of what American officials have demanded. During his summit meeting today with President Moon Jae-in of South Korea, Mr. Kim agreed to dismantle a missile testing facility under the supervision of outside experts. He also said he would visit Seoul, the Souths capital, which would be a first for a North Korean leader.  North Korean demands: Mr. Kim has called for corresponding measures from the U.S., like declaring a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, which was halted only with a truce. Its back, a North Carolina resident whose home has flooded twice in two years said on Tuesday. Same nightmare. Hurricanes have long been a fact of life in the Carolinas, but the past four years have been particularly punishing.

Water levels: Our maps show how much record rain pushed rivers in the Carolinas above flood levels.  Shared advice: Readers who have lived through other hurricanes offered tips for those affected by Hurricane Florence. In one of the largest settlements ever awarded to individual victims of sexual abuse in the Roman Catholic Church, four men who were abused as children reached an agreement with the Diocese of Brooklyn and a local after-school program on Tuesday. The assaults took place from 2003 to 2009, the lawyers for the victims said, when the boys were ages 8 to 12.  The crime: The victims were abused by Angelo Serrano, who taught catechism and helped organize religious education programs at a Brooklyn church. He pleaded guilty in 2011 and is serving a 15-year sentence. The Trump administration is unable to account for the whereabouts of nearly 1,500 migrant children who illegally entered the U.S. alone this year and who were placed with sponsors, congressional findings released on Tuesday show. The report has raised concerns that the children could end up with human traffickers or be used as laborers by people posing as relatives.  Government response: These children are not lost,  a spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services said. Their sponsors  who are usually parents or family members and in all cases have been vetted for criminality and ability to provide for them  simply did not respond or could not be reached when this voluntary call was made.  As the U.S.-China  trade dispute intensifies, the Trump administration has tried to shield products that are popular with American consumers from tariffs. That gets harder with each round.

We believe that a very large number of women do not desire to vote. They shrink from having to go to the polling booths on election days. They would much prefer staying at home and attending to their household duties. So said an article in The Press of Christchurch, New Zealand, after the country became the worlds first to give women the right to vote on this day in 1893. When women cast ballots later that year, The Press grudgingly admitted that it had happened without any very remarkably disastrous consequences. The victory (which enfranchised Maori women, too) was hard won. The leading causes of death in New Zealand at the time were said to be drink, drowning, and drowning while drunk. With alcoholism taking a toll on family life, the Womens Christian Temperance Union  fiercely opposed by the liquor industry  spearheaded the suffrage effort, hoping that enfranchised women could get alcohol banned. (They could not.) Kate Sheppard, New Zealands most famous suffragist, noted wryly when the Electoral Act passed that it does not seem a great thing to be thankful for that the government has declared us to be persons.  Other countries gradually followed suit: the U.S. in 1920, India in 1947, Switzerland in 1971. The latest country to enfranchise women? Saudi Arabia in 2011.

Heres the sign-up.) Good morning. Typhoon Jebi hits Japan, pollution is outsourced and Amazon lands in the trillion-dollar club.   The strongest typhoon in 25 years. At least nine deaths were reported as Typhoon Jebi made landfall in southern Japan early Tuesday afternoon. The typhoon, with winds up to 130 miles (209 kilometers) per hour, prompted officials to urge the evacuation of more than a million people. The typhoon comes during a summer plagued with weather issues, including lethal floods and landslides and deadly heat waves. _____  Outsourced jobs, sure. But outsourced pollution? Wealthy countries have been outsourcing a big chunk of their carbon emissions abroad. Theyve done this by importing more steel, cement and goods from factories in China and other countries, rather than producing them domestically. A new report on the global carbon trade estimates that 25 percent of the worlds total emissions are now being outsourced this way. About 13 percent of Chinas emissions in 2015, for example, came from making products for other countries. But theres a growing push to close this loophole, and policymakers are looking for a solution. Want to see how your hometown has warmed over the years?

Some Facebook users even provided direct coordinates for targeted attacks. Facebook insists it is policing its Libyan platform, but illegal activity is rife.

And the judge deserves a chance to clear his name. By David Lat Mr. Lat is a former federal law clerk and prosecutor. In many ways, Judge Brett Kavanaugh is the perfect Supreme Court nominee. For a dozen years, he has served with distinction on the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, the nations second most-powerful court. Before that, he held top legal jobs in the federal government, including the White House Counsels Office, and was a partner at a leading law firm. Hes almost universally praised by his former clerks, who are Republicans, Democrats and independents. Hes a devoted husband and father of two daughters who is celebrated as a leader in the federal judiciary when it comes to hiring and mentoring women. During and after his confirmation hearings, many unfair and unfounded charges were made against him. Democratic senators accused Judge Kavanaugh of committing perjury at his two prior confirmation hearings  charges that do not withstand scrutiny. Abortion rights activists attacked him for referring to certain forms of contraception as abortion-inducing drugs  but when he uttered those words, he was simply describing the litigation position of a religious group, not stating his own views. But now Mr. Kavanaugh faces new allegations, brought by a woman named Christine Blasey Ford. Her disturbing claims deserve further investigation by the Senate Judiciary Committee, even if it means delaying his confirmation vote. A delay wouldnt just be for her sake, but for the sake of Judge Kavanaugh and the Supreme Court itself. The story began last week, when Senator Dianne Feinstein forwarded to the F.B.I. a letter in which a woman claimed that Mr. Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when they were both in high school. Initially it seemed that nothing would happen, since the accuser was unwilling to come forward. The F.B.I. declined to open an investigation and the information was simply added to Kavanaughs background file for senators to consider or ignore as they saw fit. But on Sunday, Ms. Ford, who wrote the letter, broke her silence. In an interview with The Washington Post, the 51-year-old research psychologist claimed that at a summer party in the early 1980s, when she was around 15 and he was around 17, a drunken Mr. Kavanaugh pinned her to a bed, groped her and attempted to remove her clothes. When she tried to scream, she says he put his hand over her mouth. I thought he might inadvertently kill me, she told The Post. According to Ms. Ford, at some point Mark Judge, a friend of Mr. Kavanaughs who was also drunk, jumped on top of them  causing them all to fall to the floor, and allowing her to escape. Mr. Kavanaugh, now 53, has strongly denied her claims: I categorically and unequivocally deny this allegation. I did not do this back in high school or at any time. Mr. Judge has also denied the claims. Based on these denials, many supporters of Mr. Kavanaugh view Ms. Fords claims, raised after the conclusion of his confirmation hearings and just days before the Senate Judiciary Committee vote, as eleventh-hour character assassination. They argue that his confirmation should move forward, full speed ahead. I respectfully disagree. The confirmation should be delayed until there is a full investigation, followed by Senate Judiciary Committee hearings, into Ms. Fords accusations. She passed a polygraph test administered by a former F.B.I. agent, and her therapist provided The Washington Post with notes reflecting that Ms. Ford described the alleged incident in 2012. But her case is far from ironclad. For example, she cant remember or remains uncertain about many key details (including the year of the alleged incident); she told nobody contemporaneously (unlike many other alleged victims of sexual assault); and both Mr. Kavanaugh and his friend deny it. There is, as far as we know, no physical evidence. Its a true she said, he said  or, rather, they said, since two people deny this incident ever happened. But Ms. Ford should at least be heard, and not just because the #MeToo movement has made the importance of hearing out victims of alleged sexual misconduct even more obvious than it already was. The alleged perpetrator and witness should be heard from as well, and everyone involved should be placed under oath and subjected to aggressive questioning. (At least three Republican senators  Jeff Flake of Arizona, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Bob Corker of Tennessee  have expressed interest in hearing more about Ms. Ford's account, but there's no consensus yet on the preferred process.) The object lesson here is the 1991 confirmation for Justice Clarence Thomas. After a former colleague, Anita Hill, raised allegations of multiple instances of sexual harassment against Mr. Thomas, the senators heard from both key parties before the confirmation vote. The hearings had their flaws. Most notably, several witnesses on Ms. Hills side never got to testify. But the core claims were placed before the Senate before the vote. This ultimately redounded to Justice Thomass benefit. Now, whenever Ms. Hills sexual harassment allegations are raised, he or his defenders can at least say they were explored by the senators and ultimately found insufficient to deny Mr. Thomas a seat on the Supreme Court. If Mr. Kavanaugh is confirmed without further investigation of Ms. Fords charges, he and his defenders will not even be able to claim what Mr. Thomass defenders can. Judge Kavanaugh will be dogged by these accusations throughout his entire, likely decades-long service on the court. And that will lead some to question the legitimacy not just of his appointment but of the court as an institution  especially when it decides knotty social and political issues by a 5-4 vote. Considering the small number of witnesses involved  perhaps Ms. Ford, Mr. Kavanaugh, Mr. Judge, Ms. Fords husband and her therapist  an F.B.I. investigation followed by hearings wouldnt take very long. The process might not be complete before the start of the Supreme Courts new term on Oct. 1, but it should easily be able to be done before the midterm elections, if thats the concern of Senate Republicans. The way in which Ms. Fords allegations came to light was, to put it charitably, deeply unfortunate. These claims should have been thoroughly and discreetly investigated weeks ago, by nonpartisan F.B.I. agents and bipartisan Senate investigators, in a way that protected Christine Fords privacy and Brett Kavanaughs good name. But here we are. It is quite possible  or even likely  that hearings wont prevent Brett Kavanaugh from being confirmed given the equivocal evidence against him and, perhaps even more important, the number of Republicans and red-state Democrats in the Senate. But due process, which ought to matter when it comes to filling the critical seat on the highest court in the land, calls for nothing less.

Ruiz, Emily Steel, Grace Ashford and Steve Eder The text message from Christine Blasey Ford this summer worried her college best friend, Catherine Piwowarski. Over their years of friendship  as roommates, bridesmaids and parents on opposite coasts  Dr. Blasey wanted to know, had she ever confided that she had been sexually assaulted in high school? No, Ms. Piwowarski said she texted back, she would have remembered that, and was everything O.K.? Dr. Blasey didnt want to speak in detail quite yet, her friend recalled her responding. I dont know why she was asking that or what it ultimately meant or didnt mean, Ms. Piwowarski said in an interview, but she remembers thinking that the question betrayed deep turmoil. That was about a month before Dr. Blasey, a research psychologist, came forward with her allegation that Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh, President Trumps Supreme Court nominee, sexually assaulted her more than three decades ago when they were high school students in the Washington suburbs. Just days ago, both Dr. Blasey and Judge Kavanaugh  who has denied sexually assaulting her, or anyone  had been expected to testify on Monday before the Senate Judiciary Committee about the allegation, setting up a contest of credibility reminiscent of 1991, when Anita Hill leveled accusations of sexual harassment against Clarence Thomas, then a Supreme Court nominee. But it is increasingly uncertain whether that will happen. Dr. Blaseys lawyers on Tuesday called for an F.B.I. investigation of her allegation before she testifies, but the Senate Republican leadership has rejected the idea and said that a vote on the Kavanaugh nomination will go forward if she does not appear. [Dr. Blasey has agreed to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Read more on the latest developments.] Dr. Blaseys allegation has divided not just the Senate and the country, but also the overlapping social circles of the judge and the researcher, as former classmates, colleagues, friends and others have written warring letters of support in recent days. Dr. Blaseys lawyers, Debra Katz and Lisa Banks, say that since she went public with her story last weekend, she has been subjected to death threats, had her email hacked and had to leave her home. Speculation has arisen in the capital that Dr. Blasey, who had already been reluctant to come forward, may ultimately decline to testify, at least publicly. Supporters of Dr. Blasey, 51, describe her as a precise, logical scientific thinker; a community leader; a woman of integrity; and a devoted mother of two boys. Her lifes work is about telling the truth with science, said Kate Beebe DeVarney, a behavioral neuroscientist who has worked with Dr. Blasey in Silicon Valley. Christine doesnt get stuff wrong. Shes obsessive about making sure its right, she added. If Christine says something happened, I absolutely believe her. Backers of Judge Kavanaugh, 53, describe him as a precise, methodical legal thinker; a strong mentor; a pillar of the community where he and Dr. Blasey grew up; and a devoted father of two girls. Mr. Trump this week praised the judge as an outstanding intellect, who never had even a little blemish on his record. Judge Kavanaugh, a Republican, is a staunch Catholic conservative who lives in the nations capital. Dr. Blasey, colleagues say, is a Democrat from California who wore a pink brain hat when she joined fellow academics in protesting the Trump administrations proposed cuts to scientific research funding. Their histories coalesced, in Dr. Blaseys telling, in the early 1980s, in the insular, moneyed world of Washington private college preparatory schools. She began attending Holton-Arms School, a private girls prep school in Bethesda, Md., in seventh grade, joining a tight-knit group of about 65 girls. High school friends and classmates described Chrissy, as Dr. Blasey was known then, as a popular girl equally comfortable in math class and at social gatherings. Samantha Semerad Guerry said Dr. Blasey fit right in. Athletic and outdoorsy, she joined the soccer, softball and cheerleading teams. She was universally well-liked  always cheerful, affable, funny, and super smart, Ms. Guerry said. She was self-possessed, recalls Cheryl Aviva Amitay, who graduated in 1985, the year after Dr. Blasey. As a student at Holton-Arms, Dr. Blasey was part of an elite, suburban Washington community, where the families of members of Congress, white-shoe lawyers and lobbyists golfed, played tennis and swam together at a hierarchy of country clubs; Dr. Blaseys father, a business executive, formerly served as president of the Burning Tree Country Club. Students at private schools socialized with one another and participated in cross-school events. Children from Catholic schools, like Georgetown Preparatory School, which Mr. Kavanaugh and Justice Neil Gorsuch attended, and Stone Ridge School of the Sacred Heart, a girls school nearby, tended to hang around together, having often come from the same parishes and grade schools, though not exclusively. Ms. Guerry said that she knew Georgetown Prep boys through participating in school performances, and that Brett Kavanaugh was an acquaintance. Drinking was commonplace among the private school teenagers, and the laws governing alcohol and minors were more lax than now. Back then, pretty much there were parties every Friday and Saturday night, somewhere, said Samu Qureshi, a friend of Dr. Blaseys who attended Landon, the brother school to Holton Arms, two years ahead of her. Generally, parents are out and the kids are getting a keg. Holton-Armss yearbook includes pages of photographs of girls with drinks. Boys would be invited from the surrounding schools  Landon, Georgetown Prep, and St. Albans  for dances. Things could get rowdy, especially at unsupervised parties before and after school functions, students from that era recalled. A yearbook entry for Judge Kavanaugh, a varsity football and basketball player at Georgetown Prep, described him as Keg City Club (Treasurer)  100 Kegs or Bust. Mark Judge, a classmate and close friend, describes his own blackout drinking during those years in Wasted: Tales of a Gen X Drunk, his 1997 memoir about his experiences as a teenage alcoholic. The book mentions a person named Bart OKavanaugh who had puked in someones car and passed out on his way back from a party. Mr. Judge did not respond to queries this week about whether that name refers to Judge Kavanaugh. This was the environment in which Dr. Blasey, when she was about 15 years old, encountered Judge Kavanaugh at a gathering at another teenagers house in Montgomery County, Md., she said. She knew him before the alleged incident, she has said, countering a theory of mistaken identity advanced by Judge Kavanaugh and his supporters in the Senate. She had met him a couple of times, though they didnt run in the same circles and werent friends, a person close to Dr. Blasey said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss a personal matter. According to a letter sent to Senator Dianne Feinstein in July, Dr. Blasey claimed that Mr. Kavanaugh pushed her into a bedroom as she headed upstairs to a bathroom. He and someone she described as a very drunken friend  identified in later news reports as Mr. Judge  locked the door and played loud music, she wrote. Mr. Kavanaugh then pushed her on a bed, began grinding his body against hers and tried to undress her, she said. To stifle her screams, she asserted, he covered her mouth with his hand. Mr. Judge, Dr. Blasey alleged, told his friend to alternately go for it and stop. When Mr. Judge jumped on the bed, causing the three teenagers to tumble onto the floor, Dr. Blasey said she ran from the room, locked herself in the bathroom and escaped after hearing the two inebriated boys stumbling down the stairs. Dr. Blasey said she did not share a detailed account of the incident with anyone until 2012, when she and her husband, Russell Ford, an engineer, met with a couples therapist, according to a Washington Post interview. In her letter to Senator Feinstein, she described being traumatized from the high school episode, saying I have received medical treatment regarding the assault. She declined to be interviewed for this article. Mr. Judge, now an author, filmmaker and writer for conservative publications, wrote in a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee that he had no memory of the incident, adding that he never saw Brett act in the manner Dr. Ford described. Dr. Blaseys allegation has ignited heated controversy in Washingtons private school circles, reflecting the same social divisions  by gender, alma mater, class and religion  that had riven alumni as teenagers more than three decades ago. Some Georgetown Prep classmates have cast aspersions on Dr. Blasey on social media, while her allies charge hypocrisy in their overlooking a pervasive culture of misogyny that existed then. Twenty-three members of Dr. Blaseys class at Holton-Arms signed a joint letter sent to Congress this week, calling for due consideration of her claims. Another letter is signed by more than 1,000 alumnae, dating back to the class of 1948. When Ms. Guerry circulated the letter from the class of 1984, she found that Dr. Blaseys story resonated deeply. I was very much surprised by how many of my classmates wrote back to say to say they had traumatic experiences in high school, she said. When they heard Christines story, it struck a chord for them. Among them was Cheryl Amitay, a chief regulator at the Department of Veterans Affairs living in Washington. Ms. Amitay said she was leaving a house party during her sophomore year when two male teenagers who had been drinking pushed her up against a car and groped her. One reached under her skirt, she said, and tore off her underwear. I will never forget that, she said. When my mom picked me up she knew something was wrong, but I didnt say anything. You never say a thing, she went on. You feel like a jerk. After the alleged attack on Dr. Blasey, a male friend said, she fell off the face of the earth socially, failing to appear at parties and events shed previously attended. All I remember is after my junior year thinking, Wheres Chrissy Blasey? he recalled. She was the sort of person a lot of people paid attention to  she was a leader, she was great. I was like, where did she go? Dr. Blasey said the experience derailed her for four or five years, and that she struggled academically and socially, according to The Washington Post. She went on to attend the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where she studied psychology. The schools alumni directory and yearbook list her as having belonged to the Kappa Delta sorority, which had a reputation as the cheerleading sorority in the 1980s, though she was not a cheerleader at the school. She seems to have kept a low profile. I dont remember her very well, said Leigh Goodwyn, who was a member of the sorority at the time. There are not many people in the house I can say that about. Two other sorority sisters also had trouble remembering her. But she became close with Ms. Piwowarski. They would watch new bands perform in bars on the towns Franklin Street, hanging out with friends, and roomed together in an off-campus apartment their senior year. After graduating from U.N.C. in 1988, Dr. Blasey moved to California, where she earned graduate degrees from Pepperdine, Stanford and the University of Southern California. When she married Mr. Ford in 2002 in Half Moon Bay, Calif., against a backdrop of redwood trees, Ms. Piwowarski was a bridesmaid. Dr. Blasey developed a passion for surfing, which she shares with her husband and two sons. Shes been chasing waves, said Beth Stannard, a friend and former co-worker, who said Dr. Blaseys decisions to teach at Pepperdine, in Malibu, Calif., and to complete an internship at the University of Hawaii were at least partly informed by the campuses seaside locations. She and her family live in Palo Alto  where she has volunteered for her sons schools and junior lifeguard training, has restored her midcentury modern home with an eye toward historical preservation, and has attended Stanford football and basketball games with her family. The family also has a house in Santa Cruz, famed for its beaches and breaks. She can be quite the academic  someone taken very seriously at a place like Stanford  and then go out and surf with the people of Santa Cruz, Ms. Stannard said, recalling that Dr. Blasey had taken her and several colleagues surfing, followed by a lunch of fish and chips. Fellow scientists described her as a collaborative researcher and statistician, in demand among graduate students and fellow researchers who sought her more refined writing skills for reports and papers. At the University of Southern California School of Education, she worked for several years in the laboratory, where she developed a test to assess how young children cope with trauma. She was very meticulous with data, looked carefully at developing children, Dr. Gayla Margolin, who led the lab, said in an interview. In doing good science, people have to take in information and reflect it and portray it in a very honest, straightforward way. Dr. Blasey was hired in 2012 by Palo Alto University to teach as part of its doctoral psychology program, a consortium with Stanford that emphasizes clinical training. She is a co-author of a guide to statistical power analysis called How Many Subjects? used by researchers to determine how large a sample size is required to accurately test a hypothesis. Dr. Barr Taylor, a professor emeritus of psychiatry at Stanford who for a decade chaired dissertation committees in which Dr. Blasey was involved, described her as somewhat reserved. The statistics fit her personality more than the statistics shaped her personality, Dr. Taylor said. Dr. DeVarney, the Silicon Valley neuroscientist, calls Dr. Blasey a friendly but kind of geeky scientist, who is obsessive about making sure its right. The two worked together at three companies over 10 years. Dr. DeVarney said Dr. Blasey called her in August to say that she had sent a letter to Senator Feinstein about having been sexually assaulted in high school, something that had haunted her for her entire adult life. Dr. Blasey did not name the alleged attacker. She was clearly upset about it, Dr. DeVarney recalled. It was creating a lot of stress for her, and now its taken over her life. After Dr. Blasey decided to come forward with her allegation and notify Senator Feinstein, she, and later her lawyers, took steps to prepare for the fight of her life. She submitted to a polygraph, gathered notes from her therapist and searched her memory. Ive been trying to forget this all my life, and now Im supposed to remember every little detail, Dr. Blasey told a friend, Jim Gensheimer, in July, according to an account in The San Jose Mercury News. Later in the summer, she texted Ms. Piwowarski, her college friend. The query was worrisome, and Ms. Piwowarski told Dr. Blasey that she was there for her. It wasnt until Sunday night that Ms. Piwowarski learned the details of her friends account from news reports. A resident of New Bern, N.C., which was devastated by Hurricane Florence, Ms. Piwowarski said she read the story when the power came back on at her house. She felt sickened by it, she said.

Heres the sign-up.) Good evening. Heres the latest. 1. Christine Blasey Ford, who accused President Trumps Supreme Court nominee, Judge Brett Kavanaugh, of sexual assault, has not yet agreed to testify at a public hearing planned for Monday. The hearing, which was scheduled under pressure from lawmakers who said they wanted to hear from Dr. Blasey, promises to become a riveting public spectacle  and one with potentially grave implications for Judge Kavanaugh, who until last week was considered to be on a glide path to confirmation. For many, the case recalls the 1991 confirmation hearings for Justice Clarence Thomas, who was accused of sexual harassment by the law professor Anita Hill. In an Op-Ed today, Ms. Hill urged the Senate Judiciary Committee to learn from the experience, saying it must demonstrate a clear understanding that sexual violence is a social reality to which elected representatives must respond. _____ 2. President Trump weighed in on the accusations, saying Judge Brett Kavanaugh was not a man that deserves this. He falsely accused Democrats of timing the allegation to obstruct Judge Kavanaughs confirmation. Its a shame, he added, because this is a great gentleman. Separately, Mr. Trumps  team of lawyers is growing as the special counsels investigation continues  but it faces a problem: Its still partly in the dark about Mr. Trumps legal exposure. _____ 3. China is running out of options in the trade war. Since President Trump initiated tariffs on billions of dollars of Chinese goods in July, Beijing has been able to put up equal trade barriers on its end, ratcheting them up in tit-for-tat moves. But this week Mr. Trump announced new tariffs on $200 billion worth of goods. Beijing could only respond with tariffs on $60 billion worth of goods  almost everything else the country buys from the U.S. Chinas approach has failed to thwart Mr. Trumps trade offensive, leaving its leaders in a bind. They dont know what to do, said one analyst. _____ 4. Florence, though no longer a hurricane and moving past the Carolinas, is still trailing wreckage. Above, flooding in Lumberton, N.C. At least 34 people died as a result of the storm, and the authorities fear more deaths as floodwaters continue to rise. Record rainfall has caused dangerous flooding, and water levels are unlikely to recede for days. And flash flood advisories have been issued for cities along the storms northeast trajectory, including Washington, New York and Boston. _____ 5. The Diocese of Brooklyn paid $27.5 million to settle four sex abuse cases, one of the largest ever settlements obtained by victims of sex abuse within the Catholic Church. The four boys who will receive the settlement were repeatedly abused by a religion teacher at St. Lucys-St. Patricks Church, in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn. They were repeatedly raped between 2003 and 2009 when they were between the ages of 8 and 12. The size of the settlement has to be an indication of the severity of the abuse, and also of the pressure that the Catholic Church is under, said Terry McKiernan, co-director and president of BishopAccountability.org, which tracks clergy sexual abuse cases. _____ 6. The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel won five Emmys on Monday night, including best comedy series, and Game of Thrones picked up the award for best drama. Netflix and HBO tied with 23 Emmys each. The ceremony featured an onstage marriage proposal, bold fashion statements and an awkward musical bit about diversity. Here are the best and worst moments (including a proposal, above) and the full list of the winners. But there was a noticeable absence: any meaningful discussion of #MeToo. _____ 7. Silicon Valley is wading into the immigration debate, with companies experimenting with technology that could dissuade border crossings. Some policymakers believe the approach, using digital cameras and artificial intelligence, would be more effective than miles of concrete and metal. But many tech workers have made it clear in recent months that they dont want to work on government surveillance projects. _____ 8. As far as iPhones go, bigger is now definitely better, our columnist writes. Apples new smartphones are also its most expensive, but their cameras and screens make them worth the price. Read his full review here. Separately, Facebook has come under fire from job seekers accusing it of helping employers to exclude female candidates from recruiting campaigns. _____ 9. Tesla said the Justice Department had asked it for information after Elon Musk, the car companys chief executive, announced he was considering taking it private on Twitter. The disclosure appeared to indicate the authorities have opened an investigation into the episode. The disclosure came a day after a British cave explorer who helped rescue a Thai soccer team sued Mr. Musk for defamation. But despite these troubles, Mr. Musk named the Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa, right, as the first SpaceX passenger signed up to loop around the moon. Mr. Maezawa, founder of the Japanese online clothing company Zozo and a former rock drummer, pictured above with Mr. Musk, said he would like to take up to eight artists with him. _____ 10. Finally, we took a hard look at the reign of a creamy, herby, all-American classic. Yes, were talking about ranch dressing. In the 1950s, a plumber came up with the dressing mix, packaging the dry ingredients and selling them in envelopes. From there, ranch took over the nation, becoming the topping of choice for everything from chicken wings to baby carrots. (But we may have to agree to disagree about whether it belongs on pizza.)

Heres the sign-up.) Good evening. Heres the latest. 1. Rains from Hurricane Florence lashed the Carolina coast, with the storm growing in size and packing sustained winds of up to 100 miles an hour. The National Hurricane Center said the storm was likely to maintain its intensity until the eye made landfall early Friday. The storm is forecast to crawl inland, drenching a wide area with extremely heavy rains, up to 40 inches in some parts. The Times is providing unlimited access to coverage of the storm for all readers. Keep up with the latest here, and look at the full range of coverage here. In Southeast Asia, millions are bracing for Typhoon Mangkhut, a strong storm that could reach the Philippines by Friday. (Curious why Mangkhut is called a typhoon while Florence is called a hurricane? Its all about location.) _____ 2. President Trump falsely accused Democrats of inflating the death toll from Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico last year, rejecting the local governments assessment that the storm had resulted in the deaths of nearly 3,000 people. Above, a memorial for Marias victims. This week, Mr. Trump praised himself and his team for an incredibly successful job done in its response in Puerto Rico, though there is little evidence to support that claim. Separately, Mr. Trumps nominee for the Supreme Court, Judge Brett Kavanaugh, appeared to face some extra scrutiny after Senator Dianne Feinstein, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, referred information involving him to federal investigators on Thursday. She declined to make public what the matter, dating to his time in high school, involved. _____ 3. It was Primary Day in New York, where Gov. Andrew Cuomo easily defeated Cynthia Nixon, turning aside a challenge from the left that led to a bitterly contested race. Letitia James, the New York City public advocate, won the Democratic primary for attorney general, positioning her to become the first black woman in statewide elected office. Our Politics team has debuted a new newsletter designed to be a guiding hand to the issues and people reshaping the midterm elections. If youre interested, you can sign up for it here. _____ 4. A major shift in whos coming to the U.S. The foreign-born population in the United States has reached its highest share since 1910, according to government data released Thursday, and the new arrivals are more likely to come from Asia and to have college degrees than those who came in the past. The new data comes at a time when the nations changing demography has become a flash point in American politics, spurred in part by President Trumps inflammatory rhetoric. But many assertions about a surge in Latin American immigrants did not hold up. We think of immigrants as being low-skilled workers from Latin America, but for recent arrivals thats much less the case, the studys lead demographer said. _____ 5. Census Bureau figures show that the nations economic recovery has largely skipped over the millions of Americans living below the poverty line. Economists and advocates say that relatively modest gains that have been made over the last few years are fragile, endangered by the Trump administrations policies and vulnerable to a long-overdue economic downturn. If this is the best we can do, it isnt good, said a poverty expert. Separately, our reporters tracked down five of the people they spoke with in the throes of the 2008 recession. Heres what they have to say 10 years later. _____ 6. 3,677. Thats how many children age 13 or younger were sexually abused by Roman Catholic clergy in Germany over the past seven decades, according to a new study. Separately, Pope Francis has ordered an investigation into allegations that a West Virginia bishop sexually harassed adults, and has accepted his resignation. An American delegation of prelates met with Francis at Vatican City to ask for an investigation into former Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, who is accused of abusing seminarians. _____ 7. And in another high-profile investigation, Robert Mueller, the special counsel investigating President Trumps ties to Russia, has a novel P.R. strategy: silence. Mr. Mueller has reason to be cautious, given a political climate where the subtlest remark can be blown into a scandal. Even if he were to speak publicly, his choice of news outlet and interviewer would most likely be scrutinized for signs of bias. So hes letting his work speak for itself. And if the silent strategy is a gamble, our reporter writes, then he is all in. _____ 8. Sergei Skripal was not the only defector in Russias sights. The F.B.I. was alarmed when a suspected hit man showed up years ago in Florida. Some agents voiced concern that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, a former intelligence officer known to reserve scorn for defectors from their ranks, had sent an assassin to kill one he viewed as a turncoat. Ultimately, that defector remained safe. But American intelligence officials have begun to reassess the danger facing former spies living in the U.S. after Mr. Skripal was poisoned in England in March. Above, the suspects in the Skripal poisoning. _____ 9. A new genocide. The fire this month that wiped out Brazils National Museum, home to the worlds largest archive of indigenous Brazilian culture and history, was a huge loss to archaeologists, scholars and scientists. But it dealt a particular blow to descendants of Brazils oldest inhabitants, who had long fought to preserve their heritage. That place was like a memory, a computer hard drive, that at any moment, any ethnic group, from any people, could access to get information, to know where they were, to not feel lost, one tribal leader said of the museum. _____ 10. Finally, it turns out humans may have been artists for longer than we thought. Archaeologists discovered a 73,000-year-old drawing, markings on the side of a stone flake, in a South African cave. It is the oldest drawing made by human hands yet found. The discovery may provide insight into the origins of humanitys use of symbols: The nine red lines they found could reshape how we think about language, mathematics and civilization.

Using data from a NASA satellite, we looked at the typhoons intense rainfall in 3-D. In the U.S., the governor of North Carolina warned on Sunday that Florence, which is now a tropical depression, has never been more dangerous than it is right now. At least 17 people have been killed in North and South Carolina, and a flash-flood watch is in effect for most of the area today. Read the latest here. How to help: Here are some of the organizations working to aid those affected by Typhoon Mangkhut and  Hurricane Florence.  In an interview on Sunday, Christine Blasey Ford accused the Supreme Court nominee of sexually assaulting her when they were teenagers in the early 1980s. Ms. Ford, a research psychologist at Palo Alto University in California, said that a drunken Mr. Kavanaugh had pinned her on a bed during a party, groped her and covered her mouth to keep her from screaming.  Whats next: Judge Kavanaugh has denied the accusations, and a Senate committee is scheduled to vote on the nomination on Thursday. The White House aide Kellyanne Conway said today that Ms. Ford will be heard.  A larger share of the U.S. population is foreign-born now than at any time since 1910. In recent years, the trend is not so much with Latin Americans crossing the border, but with educated people from Asia obtaining visas. Many of those immigrants came through family reunification policies that the Trump administration hopes to scale back. Some experts predict that the number of immigrants granted permanent legal residency in this fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30, will show a rare decline.  Looking to 2020: Michael Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York City, is considering running for president as a Democrat. But he has sharp disagreements with the party on issues including bank regulation and stop-and-frisk police tactics.  New York Citys efforts to pull its transit system from crisis have been hampered by ancient signaling systems, creaky trains and, increasingly, by people venturing onto the tracks. There were nearly 900 incidents last year in which someone was on the tracks or hit by a train after getting too close while on the platform. This year, that number is set to rise.  The cause: Subway officials arent sure, but theres speculation it may be in part because of the many homeless people inside the system or the number of smartphones that fall onto the tracks.  Time magazine will be sold to Marc Benioff, the co-founder of the software company Salesforce, and his wife, Lynne, for $190 million.

Last week, two Russians named by Britain as the prime suspects in a nerve agent attack said that they  had merely been visiting the wonderful English city of Salisbury as tourists. They wouldnt have been alone. Near the famous Stonehenge site, the city is about 90 miles southwest of London and is perhaps most famous for its Gothic cathedral, which attracts half a million visitors a year. In Notes From a Small Island, the best-selling author Bill Bryson wrote, There is no doubt in my mind that Salisbury Cathedral is the single most beautiful structure in England. The main body of the cathedral was completed in 1258 and, as noted by one of the suspects in an interview on Russian TV, Its famous for its 123-meter spire. (Thats equivalent to 404 feet, making it the tallest church spire in Britain.) The cathedral contains the best preserved of the four original copies of Magna Carta, the 13th-century document restricting the powers of the monarch. Its also the burial place of the former British prime minister Edward Heath, and is home to what is thought to be the worlds oldest mechanical clock. The cathedral has also featured widely in literature and art, particularly in the work of the landscape painter John Constable.

By Michael Tomasky Michael Tomasky is a columnist for The Daily Beast and a contributing opinion writer. A view seems to have taken hold in Washington that the sexual assault allegations against Brett Kavanaugh by Christine Blasey Ford have let red-state Senate Democrats off the hook. These Democrats  chiefly Joe Donnelly of Indiana, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Joe Manchin of West Virginia, the three Democrats who voted to confirm Neil Gorsuch in April 2017  all face re-election in just seven weeks in states where President Trump is popular, and where majorities presumably would support Judge Kavanaughs elevation to the Supreme Court. But now, some say, the allegations against the nominee provide reason enough for them to vote no. Jim Manley, a former longtime Democratic Senate aide who knows these matters well, told Reuters on Tuesday: For those Democrats up for re-election from states that Trump carried, they now have absolutely no reason to vote for Kavanaugh. Period. End of story. They have all the cover they need. Several talking heads on cable news said much the same thing Tuesday. Im not sure its that simple. Assuming Judge Kavanaughs nomination is not withdrawn and the Republicans continue to fight for him, these three Democrats and possibly one or two others will still find themselves in a tough position. In fact, if a couple of Republicans defect from Judge Kavanaugh, these Democrats will be in an even tougher spot than before.  Imagine this hypothetical. Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski, the two Republican senators who are under the most pressure to oppose confirmation, decide to do so. That takes Judge Kavanaugh down to 49 votes. Game over. Except maybe not. At that point, Republicans, far from accepting defeat, will surely start aiming fire at the three Democrats. Their opponents will taunt them about Judge Kavanaugh on the campaign trail. Right-wing money will pour in to their states for pro-Kavanaugh (and pro-Trump) TV ads. Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader in the Senate, will let this play out and may schedule the vote for as late as he can  mid-October, even late October  to make the Democrats sweat. That will constitute enormous pressure on the red-state Democrats. If they sense their opponents are gaining steam, they may well think: Why should I cast a vote thats going to cost me my seat? Especially when even if we defeat Judge Kavanaugh, were just going to get someone else whos every bit as conservative? If one of them moves to a pro-Kavanaugh position, its likely that all three will move. Heres why. There is a standing agreement among minority parties in the Senate that in such situations, no one wants to be the 50th vote. The lone senator who provides the 50th vote can be blamed and reviled. But if all three move together, then one of them cant be singled out as having cast the dreaded 50th vote. This is one big reason there are so few 50-to-50 votes in the Senate. In fact, when one side sees it has lost, a couple other senators who can afford to cast the vote will often join in to give their colleagues cover. Beginning to see how this works? Now imagine a second scenario. Imagine that Ms. Collins and Ms. Murkowski vote no, but this time they are joined by two other Republicans, Jeff Flake of Arizona and Bob Corker of Tennessee. Now, Judge Kavanaugh is down to 47 votes. And more important, the air will be out of his balloon, emotionally. At that point, I think the three Democrats will be fully off the hook. And, of course, theres a third scenario (at least!), which I discussed here earlier, and its probably still the most likely one. All 51 Republicans stand pat, in which case some Democrats will go ahead and confirm Judge Kavanaugh. But their votes wont matter. Whether you got 51 votes or 55 or 100, they still call you Mr. Associate Justice. If all this is maddening to you, I cant say I blame you. Why dont they just do the right thing? Well, sure. But here it gets more complicated still. Whats the right thing? The Democrats, say the experts, now have a chance of recapturing control of the Senate. Their candidates are looking good in Nevada and Arizona and are competitive in Tennessee and even Texas. That majority would hinge on winning three of those four seats. But it would also depend on red-state senators like Mr. Donnelly, Ms. Heitkamp and Mr. Manchin holding theirs. Voting against Judge Kavanaugh might jeopardize that. In the long run, whats better: the Democrats helping to confirm Judge Kavanaugh and winning a majority, or standing firm against him but remaining the minority? Many would say it doesnt have to come down to those two choices, and theyre right. All this is unknowable. In the Democrats dream world, they defeat Judge Kavanaugh, win the majority, block the Republicans from getting a nominee through in the lame-duck session and then keep the seat open for two years. That could happen, too! All will hinge on a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on the sexual assault allegations, scheduled for Monday. If Ms. Blasey looks convincing, if Judge Kavanaugh looks evasive.  But dont think the mere accusations doom the nominee with all Democrats. This news isnt playing in Bismarck and Charleston the way its playing in Washington and New York. Red-state senators probably need still a little more cover.

By Linda Greenhouse Contributing Opinion Writer  For a long time, I made it a point to write about Guantnamo at least once a year. There was usually some new development to hang a column on. But the real reason was that, having chronicled the riveting legal saga sparked by the George W. Bush administrations decision to create a legal black hole at the U.S. Navy base there in which to imprison hundreds of men captured in Pakistan and Afghanistan in the aftermath of 9/11, I felt an obligation to show that I was still watching, even if most people no longer were. But gradually, as President Barack Obama left office with his promise to close Guantnamo unfulfilled, and as President Trump blustered about opening the island prison to new arrivals, and as the military commission that is supposed to try the accused 9/11 perpetrators has yet to set a trial date after six years, there has seemed nothing to say. (Since his inauguration, President Trump has permitted the release of one Guantnamo detainee, leaving an inmate count of 40, down from 780 at its peak.) True, back in June, when Supreme Court Justice Anthony M. Kennedy announced his retirement, there were a few comments about his important role in the Supreme Court majority that pushed back against both the White House and Congress in a series of Guantnamo decisions more than a decade ago. But those few references were quickly buried in the avalanche of speculation on what Justice Kennedys departure will mean for the future of gay rights and the right to abortion. Im writing about Guantnamo now because of a little noticed order that came down earlier this month from the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Thats the court on which President Trumps Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, has sat for the past 12 years. The order, and the appeal that produced it, provide a bridge between past and present, between Justice Kennedy and his former law clerk who would replace him, between a battle over the rule of law now fading into history and a battle over the future of the Supreme Court that will play out when Judge Kavanaughs Senate confirmation hearing begins next week.  The three-sentence order did not directly concern Judge Kavanaugh. He and his newest colleague on the appeals court, Gregory Katsas, did not participate in this matter, a footnote informs us. The courts other nine judges did, and all agreed not to grant an unusual request to hear, as a full court (en banc in legal terminology), an appeal brought on behalf of a Guantnamo detainee named Khalid Ahmed Qassim. Such a request typically comes after a three-judge panel has heard an appeal, but Mr. Qassims lawyers sought to skip that step, deeming it futile.  Mr. Qassim, a 41-year-old Yemeni, is one of Guantnamo forever prisoners, having been held without charge for 16 years. He filed a habeas corpus petition in Federal District Court in Washington, D.C. in July 2004, shortly after the Supreme Court ruled in Rasul v. Bush that, contrary to the governments argument, federal judges had jurisdiction to hear such cases from Guantnamo inmates. Mr. Qassims petition, along with others, was kept in abeyance as cases that would inevitably bear on it traveled up and down the legal system. Finally, in May, a federal district judge, Thomas F. Hogan, denied the petition in a brief oral ruling. Binding precedent of the circuit left him no choice, the judge said. Judge Hogan was correct that panel decisions of this court prevented him from granting relief to Mr. Qassim, the detainees lawyers told the appeals courts judges. And here is the link to Judge Kavanaugh. The lawyers cited four D.C. Circuit decisions that they say have flouted the Supreme Courts holding in Boumediene v. Bush, the 2008 decision that recognized a constitutional right  not simply a statutory right, as in the earlier Rasul case  for Guantnamo inmates to seek federal court review of the legality of their detention. The four decisions, the lawyers asserted, have left Mr. Qassim and others at Guantnamo caught in a trap from which they cannot escape based on rules set by panels of this court that are directly contrary to the Supreme Courts ruling in Boumediene. Under federal court practice, panels within an appeals court must accept each others decisions as binding, unless and until the full court announces a change of course. The Qassim case will now go to an ordinary three-judge panel, which may send it back to Judge Hogan for additional fact-finding in advance of a renewed appeal. Judge Kavanaugh did not write an opinion in any of the four cases. But he was a member of the panels that decided two of them, both in 2010, by 3-to-0 votes. One, Al-Bihani v. Obama, upheld the denial of habeas corpus for Ghaleb Al-Bihani, a Yemeni who claimed that before 9/11 he was merely a cook for a group in Afghanistan allied with the Talibans fight against the Northern Alliance. This support for the Taliban was sufficient to justify his continued detention, the panel held in an opinion by Judge Janice Rogers Brown. Wherever the outer bounds of material support lie, Judge Brown wrote, they clearly include traditional food operations essential to a fighting force and the carrying of arms. (A government review board approved Mr. Al-Bihanis release in 2014, and he was transferred to Oman.) The other case, Al-Adahi v. Obama, overturned a district judges grant of habeas corpus to Mohammed Al-Adahi, a Yemeni who had once attended an Al Qaeda training camp and stayed at an Al Qaeda guesthouse. In all, there can be no doubt that Al-Adahi was more likely than not part of Al Qaeda, Judge A. Raymond Randolph wrote for the panel. In granting Mr. Al-Adahis petition, the district judge had found aspects of the governments evidence unreliable. But judges must view the governments evidence as a whole, not piece by piece, Judge Randolph wrote, in order to see whether taken as a whole it meets the deferential standard of more likely than not. The government had easily met that test in Mr. Al-Adahis case, Judge Randolph said.  Mr. Al-Adahi was cleared for release in 2016 and transferred to the United Arab Emirates. Judge Randolph has been openly contemptuous of the Supreme Courts Boumediene decision. In a speech in 2011, he compared the justices to Daisy and Tom Buchanan in The Great Gatsby, characters who smashed things up and let other people clean up the mess they made. Asked in an interview for Columbia Universitys Rule of Law Oral History Project in 2013 whether it was fair to say that you think the Supreme Court was all wet three times running  a reference to the courts three rounds of Guantnamo rulings that culminated in Boumediene  Judge Randolph answered Yes. In their appeal to the full D.C. Circuit in Mr. Qassims case, the lawyers noted that following the Boumediene decision in 2008, district judges heard 53 habeas corpus petitions from Guantnamo detainees and granted 38 of them, a rate of 70 percent. But since the four panel rulings that purported to interpret Boumediene, not a single habeas petition contested by the government has been granted, and every previous district court grant of habeas appealed by the government has been reversed. As a result, they wrote, these ruling have eviscerated Boumedienes holding that Guantnamo detainees are entitled to a meaningful opportunity to contest the basis for their detentions. The author of the majority opinion in Boumediene was Justice Kennedy. The vote was 5 to 4, and the split was even more bitter than the vote count suggests. Justice Antonin Scalia, in a dissenting opinion that Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel A. Alito Jr. also joined, warned of disastrous consequences from the decision and predicted that it will almost certainly cause Americans to die. Justice Kennedys majority opinion was powerful, a paean to the rule of law that echoed well beyond a particular military prison on a particular island. Within the Constitutions separation-of-powers structure, he wrote, few exercises of judicial power are as legitimate or as necessary as the responsibility to hear challenges to the authority of the Executive to imprison a person. That was especially so when detention was by executive authority rather than following a trial and conviction for a crime, he said. In this context the need for habeas corpus is more urgent, he added. The habeas court must have sufficient authority to conduct a meaningful review of both the cause for detention and the Executives power to detain. Did these words by his old boss ring in Judge Kavanaughs ears as he signed on to opinions that left the promise of the Boumediene decision an empty one? And if not, why not? I dont know. But I do know that Guantnamo has always been a mirror that reflects back on ourselves. And the reflection in this instance gives us another hint of what the substitution of Brett Kavanaugh for Anthony Kennedy may mean for the future of the court and the country.

Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court was thrown into uncertainty on Sunday as a woman came forward with explosive allegations that Mr. Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when they were teenagers more than three decades ago. The woman, Christine Blasey Ford, 51, a research psychologist at Palo Alto University in Northern California, said in an interview with The Washington Post that during a high school party in the early 1980s, a drunken Mr. Kavanaugh pinned her on a bed, groped her and covered her mouth to keep her from screaming. I thought he might inadvertently kill me, the newspaper quoted her as saying. He was trying to attack me and remove my clothing. Judge Kavanaugh has denied the accusations, and in a terse statement on Sunday, the White House said it stood by those denials. It signaled that it had no intention of pulling the nomination. But Ms. Fords decision to put her name behind accusations that began to circulate late last week  a choice made after weeks of reluctance  appeared to open a door to a delay in a Senate committee vote on the nomination scheduled for Thursday. The disclosure also injected a volatile #MeToo element into the confirmation debate, one that is playing out in the overwhelmingly male Republican-led Senate during a midterm election that has energized Democratic women. Ms. Fords attorney, Debra Katz, told CNN on Monday that Ms. Ford was willing to testify before Congress, if asked. One Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, Jeff Flake of Arizona, told Politico that he was not comfortable voting yes on the nomination until he learned more about Ms. Fords account. A single Republican objection on the committee, which has 11 Republicans and 10 Democrats, could force a delay. Another Republican on the panel, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, said on Twitter that if Ms. Ford wishes to provide information to the committee, I would gladly listen to what she has to say and compare that against all other information we have received about Judge Kavanaugh. But he said he hoped to keep the process on schedule. Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, made a similar statement to Politico. Ms. Fords account comes as Democrats are already raising questions about Judge Kavanaughs truthfulness during his confirmation hearings this month. They have accused him of dissembling on a range of issues from his time in the George W. Bush White House, including a breach of secret Democratic files on judicial nominations and discussions about detainee policy and torture. The new revelation prompted a hurried effort by Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the Judiciary Committee chairman, to set up conference calls to allow Democratic and Republican aides to interview both Judge Kavanaugh and Ms. Ford before Thursdays scheduled committee vote. A spokesman, Garrett Ventry, said it was routine to hold such calls when updates are made to nominees background files. Senate Republican leaders in the hours after The Posts article was published indicated that they intended to move forward with voting on him. Republicans planned to argue that unless corroborating information came to light, they had no way of verifying her story and saw no reason to delay the vote, according to a person involved in the discussions. The decision about any delay in the vote could rest on the opinions of two Republican women: Senators Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine. Both are publicly undecided about Judge Kavanaugh. Ms. Collins said in an interview on Sunday night that she considered the allegations serious and that Ms. Ford needed to be personally interviewed to get a fuller account. But Ms. Collins, who could conceivably decide the outcome in the narrowly divided Senate, said Democrats had done a disservice to both Ms. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh with their handling of the accusations. What is puzzling to me is the Democrats, by not bringing this out earlier, after having had this information for more than six weeks, have managed to cast a cloud of doubt on both the professor and the judge, she said. If they believed Professor Ford, why didnt they surface this information earlier so that he could be questioned about it? And if they didnt believe her and chose to withhold the information, why did they decide at the 11th hour to release it? It is really not fair to either of them the way it is was handled. The White House, which has taken great pains to portray Judge Kavanaugh as a champion of women, sought to bolster him by pointing to statements by women who have known him and testified to his character. Those included a letter from 65 women who said that they knew him in high school and that he had always treated women with decency and respect. Advisers to Mr. Trump were trying to avoid publicly assailing the accuser while hoping that the lack of contemporaneous corroboration for Ms. Fords account would mean that Senate Republicans could move ahead without addressing it in detail. More delicately, advisers were privately urging Mr. Trump, who has been accused of sexual harassment by more than a dozen women, not to speak out about the allegations against Judge Kavanaugh on Twitter for fear that he would only inflame the situation. Still, some of the presidents allies on the right excoriated Ms. Ford  a registered Democrat  as a partisan. But Democrats and their liberal allies rallied around her, praising her courage and deeming her allegations credible. Senator Dianne Feinstein, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, called the accusations extremely serious and said they bear heavily on Judge Kavanaughs character. She urged critics of his accuser to stop the attacks and stop shaming her. Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington, went one step further, invoking Anita Hill, who came forward during Justice Clarence Thomass 1991 confirmation hearings to accuse him of sexual harassment. I was motivated to run for the Senate after watching the truly awful way Anita Hill was treated by an all-male Judiciary Committee interrogating her about the sexual harassment she endured at the hands of now-Justice Clarence Thomas, Ms. Murray said in a statement, adding that the hearings must be delayed. There is an important difference between the two cases, however: Ms. Hill detailed harassment that took place in the workplace, when she and Justice Thomas were adults. The Posts article included an interview with Ms. Fords husband and her lawyer, Ms. Katz, and described a therapists notes from 2012 in which Ms. Ford told of the attack. At Ms. Katzs urging, Ms. Ford also underwent a polygraph examination in early August; the retired F.B.I. agent who conducted the examination, Jerry Hanafin, said in an interview on Sunday that the results showed no deception indicated  in effect, she was being truthful. Her account has also been detailed in a confidential letter that Ms. Feinstein has shared with the F.B.I. She disclosed its existence on Thursday, although she had been in possession of it since late July. Most lawmakers have yet to read the letter Ms. Feinstein sent to the F.B.I., and Senate aides and lawmakers were privately weighing the implications of Ms. Fords interview on Sunday. Republicans on the Judiciary Committee said that if Ms. Feinstein had taken the allegations seriously, she should have brought them up earlier. It raises a lot of questions about Democrats tactics and motives to bring this to the rest of the committees attention only now, the statement said. But Ms. Katz said that throughout August, Ms. Feinsteins aides had checked back with Ms. Katz from time to time to see if Ms. Ford would go public. But Ms. Ford, fearing she would be attacked, wanted to remain private, and the senator respected her wishes, Ms. Katz said. She said Ms. Ford decided to reveal herself only because journalists began contacting her, and inaccurate stories about her began circulating. We do think that Feinstein did well by her, and we do think that people took this decision away from her, and thats wrong, Ms. Katz said. If the #MeToo era teaches us anything, its that a person gets to choose when, where and how, and now this person is going to be injected into a life-altering blood bath. The New York Times published an account of the letter on Friday. In her interview with The Post, Ms. Ford offered further detail, saying that one summer in the early 1980s, Mr. Kavanaugh and a friend, both stumbling drunk, led her into a bedroom at a home in Montgomery County, Md., in suburban Washington, where teenagers had gathered. The woman was wearing a bathing suit under her clothes. While his friend watched, the woman said, Mr. Kavanaugh pinned her down, grinding his body against hers and trying to pull off her one-piece bathing suit and the clothing she wore over it. She said she was able to escape when Mr. Kavanaughs friend, Mark Judge, jumped on top of them, sending all three tumbling. She told The Post that she ran from the room, briefly locked herself in a bathroom and then fled the house. In the interview, Ms. Ford said the lasting trauma from the attack had derailed me substantially for four or five years, and had caused anxiety for years after that. Judge Kavanaugh, in a statement released last week, said: I categorically and unequivocally deny this allegation. I did not do this back in high school or at any time. In an interview with The Times on Friday, Mr. Judge, who had learned from reporters that he was the other student named in the letter, denied that any such episode had taken place. It never happened, he said. I never saw anything like what was described. Further, he said it did not match Mr. Kavanaughs character: It is not who he is. Ms. Fords account opens a window into the exclusive prep school culture in which Mr. Kavanaugh grew up. The alleged assault occurred while he was a student at Georgetown Preparatory School, and Ms. Ford was a student at another private school, Holton-Arms, where she was a cheerleader in her senior year. She graduated in 1984. Reporting was contributed by Carl Hulse, Peter Baker, Nicholas Fandos, Maggie Haberman, Michael S. Schmidt, Steve Eder, Rebecca R. Ruiz and Grace Ashford.

The 70th Primetime Emmys last night in Los Angeles had all the familiar trappings of Hollywood award shows: red carpet photo shoots, dramatic envelope rites, stiff banter and celebrity close-ups. In many ways, though, the show reflected the tensions and changes animating the television industry in 2018. Two running themes throughout the ceremony  prompting speculation long before the night kicked off  were the growing role streaming services have played in recent years and the intensifying push for diversity in casting and directing. This year, Netflix led the pack with 112 nominations and ended HBOs 17-year streak as the most nominated platform. In the end, Netflix and HBO called it a tie; both came away with 23 Emmys each. HBO claimed the top prize when Game of Thrones won for best drama. But it was Amazon that won for best comedy series for The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, one of five awards the show received at the ceremony. Notably, this year the Emmys boasted the most diverse group of nominees in its history  as those who watched the program were reminded a number of times. Yes indeedy, one step closer to a black Sheldon, joked Kenan Thompson of Saturday Night Live, referring to the lead character in The Big Bang Theory. Comedians and presenters throughout the evening were quick to mock premature back-patting on inclusion and sexual harassment. A whimsical but pointed musical segment opened the show: We solved it! Kate McKinnon and Mr. Thompson sang. Throughout the number they were joined by Sterling K. Brown, Tituss Burgess, Kristen Bell, Ricky Martin and John Legend. (The actual point was: They have not solved it.) Amid the ceremonies, one unscripted moment nearly stole the whole show: The director Glenn Weiss  who won in the variety special category for directing last years Oscars  drew stunned cheers and an outpouring on social media when he proposed to his girlfriend live on stage. She said yes.

He unequivocally denied her years-old charges of sexual misconduct. Calls mounted to delay the vote and investigate. It was late September, and a Supreme Court seat hung in the balance. For those of a certain age in Washington, the past few days have felt like an eerie echo of the confirmation battle that consumed the capital in 1991 when Anita F. Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexually harassing her. Now it is Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh who faces a hearing on Monday to address explosive accusations by Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her when they were teenagers. While not a perfect parallel, the case has quickly polarized Judge Kavanaughs confirmation process, once again drawing in all three branches of government for a showdown over sex, truth and politics. Justice Thomas ultimately prevailed, and has been on the Supreme Court for more than a quarter of a century. But this time the battle takes place in a different era, at a moment when the #MeToo movement has brought down many powerful men over accusations of sexual misconduct that were once swept under the rug. I am stunned that this is happening again, said Barbara Boxer, a former Democratic senator from California who, as a representative in 1991, was part of a group of female members of the House who marched across the Capitol plaza to demand that their own party give Ms. Hill a fair hearing. But it is not surprising because our culture has not completely dealt with inequality between men and women. [Read: Why women can take years to come forward with sexual assault allegations] Washington now faces a test of what, if anything, was learned from the Thomas-Hill hearings that riveted a nation for a fall weekend almost exactly 27 years ago. Neither side emerged from that confirmation crucible happy about the process, and for some, the scar tissue remains deep. Justice Thomas and Ms. Hill both remain aggrieved a generation later, each feeling badly treated under the klieg lights. Republicans were excoriated for their cross-examination of Ms. Hill, and Democrats like Joseph R. Biden Jr., then the committee chairman, were blamed for not taking her seriously enough. Conservatives were embittered by what they considered a last-minute attack on their nominee. Many of the same dynamics are playing out in the questions raised about Judge Kavanaugh. Its dj vu all over again, said Kenneth M. Duberstein, a former White House chief of staff under President Ronald Reagan who led the confirmation fight for Justice Thomas on behalf of President George Bush. But one major difference is that, this time, race is not an issue as it was with Justice Thomas, who angrily called the accusations against him a high-tech lynching for uppity blacks who in any way deign to think for themselves. And the proliferation of social media that did not exist in 1991 has added its own heightened effect. Were seeing the same thing years later in a different modern era of communication, said Tom Korologos, a longtime Washington lobbyist who helped Republican presidents during Supreme Court nominations, although not the battle over Justice Thomas. A lot is going to depend on how it plays. This is too close to the election for anybody to do anything wrong and take a chance. Ron Klain, who was the chief counsel for the Judiciary Committee Democrats at the time of the Thomas hearings, said that to avoid repeating mistakes, the panel should enlist a professional outside lawyer to question both Judge Kavanaugh and Dr. Blasey at a public hearing rather than have senators grill them. There are a few players still involved from 1991. Senators Charles E. Grassley of Iowa and Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, both Republicans, were on the Judiciary Committee then as now. Back then, Mr. Hatch said Ms. Hills account struck him as too contrived, too slick. On Monday, he said Dr. Blasey might be mixed up and confused Judge Kavanaugh with someone else. There are some significant differences between the two situations. Justice Thomas was accused of sexually harassing Ms. Hill in the workplace but not physically assaulting her. He was a senior official at two government agencies at the time of the alleged behavior, and she was his subordinate. Judge Kavanaugh is accused of pinning Dr. Blasey to a bed, groping her, trying to remove her clothes and covering her mouth with his hand to muffle her screams while drunk at a party during high school. He was about 17 at the time, and she was about 15. Neither Ms. Hill nor Dr. Blasey reported the episodes to the authorities at the time, but what has changed since 1991 is the default setting. Whether fairly or not, the burden of proof often seemed to lie with Ms. Hill in 1991, which outraged many who believed her account. Today, in the #MeToo moment, there is more of a presumption that women who come forward with accusations should be given the benefit of the doubt, which worries Judge Kavanaughs friends who say he may be smeared unfairly. Ms. Boxer said she thoroughly believes Dr. Blaseys account. The fact is that we know this woman is telling the truth in a case where the woman had everything to lose, tries to remain anonymous, didnt want the publicity attached to her, she said. Why cant people step up after all these years? Ms. Boxer asked. If we do the same thing and rush to judgment when a credible woman is putting everything on the line for truth, shame on this country. There will be reverberations. Representative Nita M. Lowey of New York was another of the Democratic women who stormed the Senate and demanded entrance to an ongoing meeting of Democratic senators to push the cause of Ms. Hill. Once again you have a woman who is very credible and very serious allegations of sexual misconduct, she said. I would hope that men or women would listen to Dr. Fords accusations under oath and listen to Judge Kavanaugh under oath. President Trump defended Judge Kavanaugh on Monday as one of the finest people that Ive ever known who was investigated repeatedly by the F.B.I. over the years for various government positions and never had even a little blemish on his record. Former Senator John C. Danforth, Republican of Missouri, who was one of Justice Thomass most prominent defenders, said that he sees a tragic repeat. I just feel so terribly sorry for Kavanaugh and what hes going through, he said. Heres a man whos had just a marvelous reputation as a human being and now its just being trashed. I felt the same way about Clarence. He added that the presumption of guilt has only grown since 1991. With the #MeToo movement, it makes it even harder for him, Mr. Danforth said. It was bad enough for Clarence, but this is really going to be difficult. In one way, Mr. Trump and other Republicans approached this situation differently than in 1991  careful, at least for now, not to directly challenge Dr. Blaseys credibility and risk looking like they were attacking a victim of assault. Indeed, the message from Mr. Trump and congressional Republican leaders was that they wanted to hear from her, and they even agreed to a televised hearing. Instead, Republicans focused on assailing Democrats for not bringing up the issue earlier and instead injecting it into the process only days before the Judiciary Committee was scheduled to vote on Thursday. Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, complained that Democrats did not raise the matter either in closed session or in public hearings. But now  at the 11th hour, with committee votes on the schedule, after Democrats have spent weeks and weeks searching for any possible reason that the nomination should be delayed  now, they choose to introduce this allegation, Mr. McConnell said. Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, who was secretly contacted by Dr. Blasey in July, said she did not tell the rest of the panel at first because Dr. Blasey insisted on maintaining confidentiality. After word of her accusations surfaced last week, Dr. Blasey agreed to be identified in an interview published in The Washington Post and now says she would testify if asked. One aspect of this fight that is strikingly different is the makeup of the Senate. During the Thomas hearings, there were only two female senators  Barbara Mikulski, Democrat of Maryland, and Nancy Kassebaum, Republican of Kansas  and neither of them belonged to the all-male Judiciary Committee. Today, the Senate has 23 women  17 Democrats and six Republicans  and four Democratic women serve on the Judiciary Committee. The handling of the Thomas hearing, in fact, was instrumental in inspiring the so-called Year of the Woman with then-record numbers of female candidates in 1992  including Ms. Feinstein. Female voters angered by the treatment of Ms. Hill helped defeat some Democratic senators who voted for Justice Thomas. The California seat of Ms. Boxer, who did not run for re-election in 2016, has been taken over by Kamala Harris, a Democrat and the junior member of the Judiciary Committee, who challenged multiple elements of Judge Kavanaughs testimony during hearings at the beginning of September. Democrats controlled the Senate in 1991 when Ms. Hills accusations became public only two days before the floor vote, but many Southern Democrats were leery of voting against Justice Thomas, who would be only the second African-American justice to serve on the Supreme Court and had a compelling up-from-poverty life story. Nonetheless, the White House counted 77 potential votes for Justice Thomas before Ms. Hills accusations surfaced. He ultimately was confirmed with 52 votes. Todays Republicans do not enjoy nearly such a margin for error, holding just 51 seats and unable to count on Democrats to join them. Several Republicans are alienated from Mr. Trump and, unlike in 1991, the hearing will come only 43 days before an election. Senators are nervous already, Mr. Korologos said. Were too dadgum close to an election. Follow Peter Baker and Carl Hulse on Twitter: @peterbakernyt and @hillhulse.

Speaking through lawyers, Christine Blasey Ford said she would cooperate with the Senate Judiciary Committee and left open the possibility of testifying later about her allegations against Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh. But echoing Senate Democrats, she said an investigation should be the first step before she is put on national television to relive this traumatic and harrowing incident. Republicans signaled Tuesday night that they would not negotiate an alternative date and would go ahead with the hearing without her or declare it unnecessary if she refuses to appear, then possibly move to a vote. They have repeatedly stressed that Monday would be Dr. Blaseys opportunity to testify, either privately or publicly, and that they planned to move forward with the confirmation process afterward. The apparent standoff was yet another turn in a high-stakes drama over the presidents second Supreme Court nominee that began Thursday, when the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee revealed that she had referred the sexual assault allegations to federal investigators. Dr. Blasey, a research psychologist in Northern California, has accused Judge Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her more than 30 years ago when they were teenagers at a boozy high school party, a charge that he has categorically denied. In a letter sent to the committee on Tuesday evening, Dr. Blaseys lawyers charged that some senators have already made up their minds, but she did not explicitly reject appearing before them. In an appearance on CNN, however, one of the lawyers, Lisa J. Banks, seemed to suggest that Dr. Blasey would not show up on Monday. Shes not prepared to talk with them at a hearing on Monday, Ms. Banks said. Even if Republicans agreed to an F.B.I. investigation, it would take time to complete, she added. No legitimate investigation is going to happen between now and Monday. Democratic leaders quickly endorsed Dr. Blaseys position, but her resistance to coming to the committee on Monday seemed to harden the resolve of Republicans who said they gave her a chance to make her case. Republicans extended a hand in good faith, said Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, one of the Republicans who insisted on postponing a vote until she could be heard. If we dont hear from both sides on Monday, lets vote. Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa and the Judiciary Committee chairman, said he would welcome Dr. Blasey for a staff-led interview or a private hearing, if she preferred, but made clear he was sticking with the schedule for Monday. A letter that was sent by Christine Blasey Fords lawyers to the Senate Judiciary Committee. Dr. Fords testimony would reflect her personal knowledge and memory of events, he said in a statement. Nothing the F.B.I. or any other investigator does would have any bearing on what Dr. Ford tells the committee, so there is no reason for any further delay. Mr. Trump joined other Republicans in rejecting an F.B.I. investigation of the long-ago episode even before Dr. Blaseys letter was sent on Tuesday evening. The bureau said that they really dont do that, thats not what they do, Mr. Trump said during a news conference. And now they have done supposedly six background checks over the years as Judge Kavanaugh has gone beautifully up the ladder. In the letter to the Judiciary Committee, Dr. Blaseys lawyers said that she has been the target of vicious harassment and even death threats since her name was made public on Sunday in an interview published in The Washington Post. Her email has been hacked, she has been impersonated online and she and her family have been forced to relocate out of their home, according to the lawyers, Ms. Banks and her partner, Debra S. Katz. While Dr. Fords life was being turned upside down, you and your staff scheduled a public hearing for her to testify at the same table as Judge Kavanaugh in front of two dozen U.S. Senators on national television to relive this traumatic and harrowing incident, the lawyers wrote to Mr. Grassley. The hearing would include interrogation by senators who appear to have made up their minds that she is mistaken and mixed up. Dr. Blasey, who is sometimes referred to by her married name, Ford, wants to cooperate with the committee and with law enforcement officials but believes that a full investigation by the F.B.I. would be necessary to form a nonpartisan assessment before any hearing, the lawyers wrote. Both Dr. Blasey, 51, and Judge Kavanaugh, 53, had said on Monday morning that they were willing to come before the committee. In response, Mr. Grassley postponed a vote on the judges confirmation and scheduled the hearing for next week. An aide to Mr. Grassley said that the committee never intended to seat the two witnesses together at one table or even on one panel. Democrats and Republicans spent much of Tuesday arguing over the scope and shape of what such a hearing would entail. Mr. Grassley told the radio host Hugh Hewitt that Judge Kavanaugh and Dr. Blasey would be the only witnesses, prompting pushback from top Democrats. Another potential witness, Mark Judge, a friend of Judge Kavanaughs who Dr. Blasey said was in the room when the assault occurred, told the Judiciary Committee he does not remember it. I never saw Brett act in the manner Dr. Ford describes, he said in a statement sent by his lawyers, adding that I do not wish to speak publicly about the matter. As senators in both parties grappled with how to move forward, Mr. Trumps advisers and Judge Kavanaughs allies appeared to be settling on a strategy of defending him by suggesting that this must be a case of mistaken identity. Under the emerging strategy, Judge Kavanaughs defenders would accept that Dr. Blasey was in fact assaulted but would insist that it must have been by someone other than Judge Kavanaugh because he denied it. The approach reflects the shifting reality of the #MeToo movement when it has become politically perilous to directly attack the credibility of women who come forward to tell their stories. By suggesting that perhaps there was confusion after more than 30 years, White House allies said that they could offer wavering Republicans whose votes are critical for his confirmation another explanation for the he-said-she-said conflict without tearing down Dr. Blasey. The line of defense seemed to be previewed on Monday when Judge Kavanaugh called Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah and a member of the Judiciary Committee, to discuss the allegations. Mr. Hatch told reporters afterward that he believed Judge Kavanaugh. I think shes mistaken something or is mixed up, he said. Two people familiar with the call, who did not want to be identified discussing it, said the judge insisted to Mr. Hatch that he did not do what he was accused of and then, in response to a question, agreed it was possible Dr. Blasey was thinking of somebody else. Dr. Blasey has been uncertain about some details of the episode, including when it happened and whose house they were at. But this strategy carries its own risks. The letter from Dr. Blaseys lawyers strongly suggested that it would be offensive to assert that she would not remember who pinned her down to a bed, groped her, tried to take her clothing off and covered her mouth to keep her from screaming at that party in the 1980s. Judge Kavanaugh has told associates that he did not know who his accuser was until she identified herself in The Post and that, once he saw her name, he vaguely recalled her being part of the social circle associated with his all-boys high school in suburban Maryland at the time. A person close to Dr. Blasey, who asked not to be identified to discuss the situation in detail, said Dr. Blasey knew the future Judge Kavanaugh in passing before the gathering where she says the attack took place, which could make it harder for his defenders to make a case that she had confused him for someone else. The conflicting stories generated political fireworks in Washington on Tuesday. Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, posted on Twitter a video clip of Judge Kavanaugh speaking at his alma mater, Georgetown Preparatory School, in 2015. What happens at Georgetown Prep stays at Georgetown Prep, he said to laughter. Thats been a good thing for all of us, I think. Ms. Warren added: I cant imagine any parent accepting this view. Is this really what America wants in its next Supreme Court Justice? For their part, the White House and other Republicans seized on comments Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, made to Fox News. I cant say everythings truthful, she said of Dr. Blaseys account. I dont know. The White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, cited that and added, Now clear why top Democrat on Senate Judiciary Committee did nothing with allegation for months or even ask Judge Kavanaugh about it. Ms. Feinstein later clarified on Twitter: During every step of this process, Ive found every single piece of information from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford eminently credible, sincere and believable. Dr. Blaseys allegations are inevitably evoking comparisons to 1991 confirmation hearings of Clarence Thomas, who was accused of sexual harassment by the law professor Anita F. Hill. The sight of Professor Hill being grilled on national television by an all-white, all-male Judiciary Committee enraged women, contributing to the so-called Year of the Woman in 1992, when scores of women ran for public office. Republicans, clearly hoping to avoid a repeat of the Hill-Thomas scenario, were considering employing a special counsel or staff member to question Dr. Blasey and Judge Kavanaugh. Democrats accused Republicans of trying to rush through a hearing without a proper investigation of serious charges. She is under no obligation to participate in the Republican efforts to sweep the whole thing under the rug, to continue this nomination on a fast track, said Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington, who won her Senate seat in 1992. Its basically a railroad job. This is what they did to Anita Hill. But while Republicans hoped to avoid appearing to aggressively attack Dr. Blaseys credibility, they made clear on Tuesday that they will vigorously defend Judge Kavanaugh, who until last week seemed on a glide path to confirmation. Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the chambers No. 2 Republican, called Dr. Blaseys accusations a drive-by attack on the character of this judge, and referred to them as false allegations, in remarks on the Senate floor. Uncharacteristically, the combative Mr. Trump on Tuesday stuck to the strategy of not attacking the accuser directly as well, instead expressing sympathy and faith in Judge Kavanaugh while assailing Democrats for trying to torpedo his nominee. I feel so badly for him that hes going through this, to be honest with you, Mr. Trump said of the judge. I feel so badly for him. This is not a man that deserves this. The president repeated the attack on Ms. Feinstein for not raising the issue earlier in the confirmation process, given that Dr. Blasey first contacted her in July. Why didnt the Democrats bring it up then? he said. Because they obstruct and because they resist. Thats the name of their campaign against me. For some liberals, the charge of obstructionism rang hollow given that Republicans refused to even meet with President Barack Obamas Supreme Court nominee Merrick B. Garland in 2016. In this case, Ms. Feinstein said she did not raise the issue earlier because Dr. Blasey requested confidentiality. Only after word of the accusations leaked out last week did Dr. Blasey shift gears and agree to be named publicly. Professor Hill, in an opinion article published Tuesday in The New York Times, warned senators against repeating her experience in 1991. That the Senate Judiciary Committee still lacks a protocol for vetting sexual harassment and assault claims that surface during a confirmation hearing, she wrote, suggests that the committee has learned little from the Thomas hearing, much less the more recent #MeToo movement. An earlier version of this article misstated what Mark Judge told the Senate Judiciary Committee. He said that he does not remember the episode, not that he does.

Kavanaugh hasnt just upended what was expected to be his relatively easy Senate confirmation to the Supreme Court. The allegation has also scrambled the political calculations for 10 Democratic senators running for re-election in states won by President Trump, particularly three moderate Democrats who had been weighing a yes vote. Few politicians have a greater stake in Judge Kavanaughs fate than these 10 senators who are trying to appeal to red-state voters back home, and whose re-election bids will determine whether Democrats win control of the narrowly divided chamber in November. Before Christine Blasey Ford accused Judge Kavanaugh of assaulting her when they were teenagers, many of these senators were simply happy that the Kavanaugh nomination hadnt become a rallying cry for the conservative base. They hoped they could vote no without political consequences, because he was so likely to be confirmed with Republican votes, and then move on to more favorable terrain. And for three of the most moderate Senate Democrats  Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Joe Manchin III of West Virginia and Joe Donnelly of Indiana  the nomination represented an opportunity for them to vote yes on Judge Kavanaugh and demonstrate independence from their party and deny Republicans an issue in the fall campaign. The three had previously supported President Trumps first nominee for the court, Justice Neil M. Gorsuch. But Dr. Blaseys accusation is now leading Senate Democrats to assess whether she has given them an easy pass to vote no on his nomination  or if they could face controversy over a 36-year-old allegation that they would rather not deal with in the midterm campaign. [Make sense of the people, issues and ideas shaping the 2018 elections with our new politics newsletter.] The political risks and opportunities for Democrats  and for the partys Senate candidates in competitive races in Arizona, Nevada, Tennessee and Texas  may not be clear until after Judge Kavanaugh and Dr. Blasey testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee. He is scheduled to do so on Monday; she has been invited to, but has called for an F.B.I. investigation of her allegation first. Yet there is rising confidence among many leading Democrats that, at the very least, the claim of sexual misconduct deprives Republicans of a potent issue to wield against senators who vote no. Any Republican attacks over Judge Kavanaugh in a campaign-season debate, for example, could be met with a rejoinder about the assault allegation. This certainly changes the dynamic a lot, said Senator Doug Jones, Democrat of Alabama, who himself will face a difficult re-election in 2020. When allegations like this are raised, even with the timing, it changes the dynamic. Mr. Jones said that if he determines Dr. Blaseys story is true, he would not support his nomination. But in an illustration of how cautiously other red-state Democrats are still treading, Senator Manchin of West Virginia would not offer a similar vow, saying he didnt want to speculate on what he may do. Everything should be taken serious and we should let the process continue, he said in a brief interview. Republicans close to Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican majority leader, say he will not back off his commitment to Judge Kavanaugh, in part because he believes the timing of the accusation is suspicious but also because he believes yanking the nomination would depress his partys base in the midterms. But Republicans acknowledge that, in pushing Judge Kavanaugh forward, they will only further imperil their House majority, which depends in part on a series of suburban districts filled with voters already enraged about Mr. Trumps treatment of women. For their part, many Senate Democrats are hoping that Judge Kavanaughs nomination is ultimately torpedoed by Republicans, who have a 51-to-49 majority in the Senate. Three key Republican senators  Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Susan Collins of Maine and Jeff Flake of Arizona  have expressed concerns about moving ahead with a vote on Judge Kavanaugh without hearing from Dr. Blasey. If they were to band together to oppose his nomination, it could seal Judge Kavanaughs fate and force Mr. Trump to withdraw his pick  and all without Democrats having to step into the fray. (Such a scenario appeared more remote after Dr. Blaseys lawyer indicated she would not testify until the F.B.I. investigates, however.) Of the potential scenarios involving the outcome for Judge Kavanaughs nomination, strategists in both parties agree that his withdrawal would be most politically damaging to Republicans. It would underscore the chaos surrounding Mr. Trump; amount to an acknowledgment that Mr. Kavanaugh is tarnished; and, by bowing to liberals demanding he not be confirmed, infuriate the conservative rank-and-file. [[Read what Judge Kavanaughs and Dr. Blaseys supporters are saying about her accusations against him.]] Democrats may not want him on the bench for a host of reasons, but Judge Kavanaugh narrowly winning confirmation would be politically tolerable to many of them, strategists say. Republicans may still target those Democrats who opposed him, but their attacks would be clouded by the assault allegation. Where the two parties differ is on the possibility that the Kavanaugh nomination is brought to a vote and defeated. Democrats fear that would enrage Mr. Trump and his supporters, prompting them to show up at the polls to take out their anger on the opposition. But Republicans worry any failure to confirm him will demoralize their base. More broadly for Democrats, though, is the question of just how much risk still remains with the vote. Some in the party believe that Judge Kavanaugh is now tainted and that the charges have effectively freed red-state Democrats to oppose him. I think its an easy vote now, said Kip Tew, a former Indiana Democratic chairman, adding that grass-roots activists would have a far more difficult time stomaching a yes vote from their senator in light of the claim of sexual misconduct. I just dont see how he can go to the base of the Democratic Party and vote yes given these revelations. Hoping to galvanize Democratic senators, a liberal group opposed to Judge Kavanaughs nomination released a commercial Tuesday linking together Mr. Trumps infamous comments on Access Hollywood; his support for Roy Moore, the Alabama Senate candidate accused of preying on teenage girls; and the accusation against Mr. Kavanaugh. We cant let Brett Kavanaugh decide on our rights for a generation, says the announcer in the ad produced by the group, Demand Justice. Enough is enough. If the moderate Democrats do oppose Judge Kavanaugh, they will most likely not only cite Dr. Blaseys story but also point to his views on the Affordable Care Act  an issue many of them have already homed in on during the campaign. Senator Mazie Hirono of Hawaii, a progressive who has been an outspoken supporter of Dr. Blasey, said there was any number of reasons her red-state colleagues could oppose Mr. Kavanaugh. And she sought to assure them that, because of the allegation, they could safely adjust their calculus on Mr. Kavanaugh. Were in a different kind of environment now, said Ms. Hirono, pointing to the fury of many women in the #MeToo and Trump era. Yet there are some Democrats who are uneasy about the bulk of October being spent on the fate of Mr. Trumps Supreme Court pick rather than on less polarizing matters. This close to an election, having an issue this significant out there, its not helpful at all to somebody running in a red state, said Byron Dorgan, a former Democratic senator from North Dakota. And with Mr. Trump effectively unable to campaign in many competitive House districts because he is too unpopular, red-state Senate Democrats have little appetite to see him repeatedly return to their states in the last stages of the election as part of a Kavanaugh-driven revenge mission. Its not easy, said Natalie Tennant, a Democrat and former West Virginia secretary of state who ran for the Senate there in 2014. Referring to Senator Manchin, she said: If he votes no, people will think hes against Trump. If he votes yes, theyll think hes for Trump. Ultimately, he has to be for West Virginia. And what that means when it comes to Judge Kavanaugh is now a lot less clear.

Kavanaugh and his accuser devolved into a polarizing stalemate on Wednesday as Democrats and Republicans advanced competing narratives to convince voters that the other side has been unfair in the Supreme Court confirmation battle. Christine Blasey Ford, the professor who alleged that Judge Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when they were teenagers, said a Senate hearing set for Monday to hear her allegation would not be fair and Democrats insisted that an F.B.I. investigation take place first. Backed by President Trump, Senate Republicans rejected any F.B.I. inquiry, and said that Monday was her chance to be heard. Dr. Blaseys resistance to appearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Monday seemed to galvanize Republicans and drew wavering Republican senators back into Judge Kavanaughs camp. Barring new information or an agreement by Dr. Blasey to testify after all, Judge Kavanaugh may now have enough momentum to be confirmed as early as next week. Republicans set a committee meeting for Wednesday for a possible vote to move the nomination to the floor. [Read how Dr. Blasey went from the anonymity of academia to the center of a Supreme Court confirmation.] Hanging over the impasse were the midterm elections, now less than seven weeks away. Republicans were determined to confirm Judge Kavanaugh before then, knowing that if Democrats managed to win control of the Senate, it would be exponentially harder to approve any nominees sent by Mr. Trump. Conversely, for Democrats, a delay in voting on Judge Kavanaugh would increase the chances of blocking his confirmation and enhance the influence Democrats would have over who eventually fills the vacant seat. In a statement, Lisa J. Banks, a lawyer for Dr. Blasey, said on Wednesday that her client was still willing to work with the Judiciary Committee, but was not convinced that a hearing featuring just her and Judge Kavanaugh would be adequate. The committees stated plan to move forward with a hearing that has only two witnesses is not a fair or good faith investigation; there are multiple witnesses whose names have appeared publicly and should be included in any proceeding, Ms. Banks said. The rush to a hearing is unnecessary, and contrary to the committee discovering the truth. Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa and the committee chairman, said he was flexible on how to handle the questioning of Dr. Blasey but not on the date. He offered to hold a public hearing or to conduct the interview behind closed doors, whichever she preferred. He said she could be questioned by staff members rather than senators, and that he would even send lawyers to California to interview her, if she liked. But he rejected Dr. Blaseys request that the F.B.I. investigate her charges before any hearing and made clear that he would not postpone it past Monday. It would be a disservice to Dr. Ford, Judge Kavanaugh, this committee and the American people to delay this hearing any further, he wrote in a letter to committee Democrats. [Read what Judge Kavanaughs and Dr. Blaseys supporters are saying about her accusations against him.] The mood at the White House improved on Wednesday, and Mr. Trump referred to Judge Kavanaugh as Justice Kavanaugh three times during a seven-minute exchange with reporters. He again avoided directly attacking Dr. Blasey, but said he found her charges hard to believe. I think its a very unfair thing whats going on, the president said. Still, he seemed to leave open the possibility that he might have to find another nominee if Dr. Blasey proved persuasive. Look, if she shows up and makes a credible showing, that will be very interesting and well have to make a decision, Mr. Trump said. But I can only say this: He is such an outstanding man. Very hard for me to imagine that anything happened. Democrats acknowledged that Republicans seemed to have reassured the members of their conference uneasy over the allegation and could confirm Judge Kavanaugh on the strength of their razor-thin 51-to-49 majority. Clearly, the Senate Republicans have decided to tough it out, and they are worried about one constituency at this point, Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, said in an interview. It is not the American public; it is the six or seven Senate Republicans who objected last week to a hurry-up hearing. They think they have them back in their corner. Still, the emergence of Dr. Blaseys allegation may have cost Republicans the chance of winning support from any of the red-state Democrats they were hoping to enlist. Senator Claire McCaskill, a Democrat facing a competitive re-election in Missouri, announced Wednesday that she will vote against confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh. Ms. McCaskill said she was concerned about the accusation against the judge, but based her decision on campaign finance law. He has revealed his bias against limits on campaign donations, which places him completely out of the mainstream of this nation, she said in a statement. Dr. Blasey, 51, a university professor in Northern California who is also known by her married name, Ford, has accused Judge Kavanaugh, 53, of pinning her to a bed, groping her, trying to remove her clothing and covering her mouth to keep her from screaming during a party in the early 1980s when the two were teenagers in Maryland. Judge Kavanaugh has categorically denied the allegation, and the only other person Dr. Blasey said was in the room has also said he does not remember such an assault and had never seen Judge Kavanaugh behave that way. Another high school friend, Patrick J. Smyth, came forward on Wednesday, saying he was one of two other people Dr. Blasey identified being elsewhere in the house at the time of the alleged assault. In a letter to the Judiciary Committee, Mr. Smyth said he did not remember anything like it. I have no knowledge of the party in question; nor do I have any knowledge of the allegations of improper conduct she has leveled against Brett Kavanaugh, he wrote. He added, I have never witnessed any improper conduct by Brett Kavanaugh towards women. With the conflict over the confirmation and the supercharged allegations taking place so close to the midterms, both sides were deeply anxious about the possible effect and were eager to blame the other. Republicans argued that they have given Dr. Blasey an opportunity to tell her story to the Senate, either in public or in private, while Democrats said the refusal to call in the F.B.I. showed that the presidents party was not really interested in finding the truth. This process has been off the rails for a long time now, but the last 24 hours signal a new low, said Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island. He noted that Dr. Blasey has been harassed and forced to leave her own home since bringing her account to the public. In the face of this, Republicans are jamming her into a take it or leave it kangaroo hearing without even the courtesy of proper investigation of her claims. It is a disgrace. Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican committee member from South Carolina and ally of the presidents who traveled with him on Wednesday to view hurricane damage, said that requiring an F.B.I. investigation before a hearing would not be about finding the truth but delaying the process until after the midterm elections, when Democrats hope to win control of the Senate. It is imperative the Judiciary Committee move forward on the Kavanaugh nomination and a committee vote be taken as soon as possible, Mr. Graham said in a statement. For many Democrats, the insistence on quick action and the charge of obstructionism rang hollow given that Republicans refused to even meet with President Barack Obamas Supreme Court nominee, Judge Merrick B. Garland, in 2016. Judge Garland never received a hearing, and the vacant seat resulting from the death of Justice Antonin Scalia was eventually filled by Mr. Trumps first Supreme Court choice, Neil M. Gorsuch. Three of the Republican senators who had insisted on postponing a committee vote on Judge Kavanaugh originally scheduled for Thursday until hearing from Dr. Blasey have now said she should testify on Monday. I dont think she can reject all those options because otherwise there are these very serious allegations hanging over the head of a nominee who has emphatically denied them, Senator Susan Collins told a radio station in her home state, Maine, on Wednesday. Thats just not a good way for us to end. So I think she needs to come forward, and we need to provide her with any protection she may ask for herself and her family. Ms. Collins noted that Dr. Blasey had secured the services of lawyers and should be prepared for testifying. Theres more than a week between when she made the allegations and the date of the hearing, she said. I just dont understand why the hearing shouldnt go forth. Following the advice of aides, Mr. Trump refrained from any inflammatory comments about the court fight. If she shows up, that would be wonderful, he told reporters before leaving for North Carolina. If she doesnt show up, that would be unfortunate. Id really want to see her, the president said. I really would want to see what she has to say. The allegations against Judge Kavanaugh appeared to diminish his public standing, according to a new Reuters/Ipsos poll. Opposition to his confirmation rose by six percentage points to 36 percent in a survey that began before Dr. Blasey went public and continued through Monday after The Post article. Only 31 percent said they support his confirmation, which would rank him among the lowest nominees if he were eventually confirmed. While Dr. Blasey and Democrats have called for an F.B.I. investigation before a hearing, it is unlikely the bureau would open a criminal investigation of Judge Kavanaugh because Dr. Blaseys accusations do not involve a potential federal crime. Sexual assault would typically be a state crime, and the passage of more than three decades would make any prosecution problematic, according to legal experts. Democrats pointed out on Wednesday that the F.B.I. was asked to investigate Anita F. Hills sexual harassment claims against Clarence Thomas when he was nominated for the Supreme Court in 1991. But Mr. Grassley said that happened when Ms. Hills allegations were still confidential and pointed out that she testified at a hearing only five days after her charges became public, much as Dr. Blasey is being asked to do. The F.B.I. does conduct background checks on Supreme Court nominees and passes along information to officials running the confirmation process, but it does not make judgments on the credibility of the claims, according to Justice Department guidelines. The F.B.I.s role in such matters is to provide information for the use of the decision makers, according to background check guidelines issued in 2010 during the Obama administration. While the F.B.I. should apprise the president or his designated representative when new information surfaces that raises questions about the suitability of an appointee, the F.B.I. does not make any judgment about the credibility or significance of any allegation.

Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when they were teenagers while he was drunk have drawn attention to a speech he gave four years ago in which he discussed heavy drinking at Yale Law School  and to an offhand remark about his high school days that he made during another speech. Earlier this week, a transcript of a 2014 speech Judge Kavanaugh apparently gave at a banquet for the Yale Law School Federalist Society surfaced via a Washington Post reporter on Twitter; some of it was later transcribed and posted by the magazine Mother Jones. The speech, in which he imparted lessons to students and reminisced about his time at school, contained one section in which Judge Kavanaugh, now 53, fondly recalled some debaucherous  if seemingly harmless  nights of heavy drinking and revelry as a Yale Law student. In one episode, he described taking a bus with his classmates to Boston for a Red Sox game and a night of barhopping, which ended with the students falling out of the bus onto the front steps of Yale Law School at about 4:45 a.m. Fortunately for all of us, we had a motto: What happens on the bus stays on the bus, the speech said. Judge Kavanaugh then went on to describe a good run in his third year of law school, in which he and his classmates got our work done, but we had our share of fun. He discussed a class party and mentioned a nearby bar, which he summarized by saying: We had a memorable evening. It is fair to say that we had a few drinks. Indeed, as a classmate of mine and I were reminiscing and piecing things together the other day, we think we had more than a few beers before the banquet. Might have been at Toads. Not a good idea. Then, on Tuesday, an apparently truncated video clip of Judge Kavanaugh giving another speech emerged. Referring to his high school in 2015, he again modified the frequently used clich: What happens at Georgetown Prep, stays at Georgetown Prep. He added: Thats been a good thing for all of us, I think. [Make sense of the people, issues and ideas shaping the 2018 elections with our new politics newsletter.] Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, tweeted the video of Judge Kavanaugh making the quip and said: I cant imagine any parent accepting this view. Is this really what America wants in its next Supreme Court Justice? Dr. Blasey has accused Judge Kavanaugh of sexual assault, saying that during a high school party in the early 1980s, he pinned her on a bed, groped her and covered her mouth to keep her from screaming. Judge Kavanaugh has categorically denied the allegation. A hearing has been set for next week, and Judge Kavanaugh and Dr. Blasey have been asked to testify. On Tuesday, lawyers for Dr. Blasey, a research psychologist at Palo Alto University in Northern California, accused some senators of having already made up their minds and insisted that the F.B.I. investigate.

In a second day of testimony, Kavanaugh declined to comment on Trumps criticism of the judiciary or offer praise of the presidents character.  Democrats at Kavanaughs Senate confirmation hearing also pressed the conservative federal appeals court judge over newly released emails highlighting his views on abortion and racial issues after a partisan fight over the public release of the documents.   The documents released on Thursday dated from Kavanaughs service in the White House under Republican President George W. Bush more than a decade ago. Democrats had objected to an earlier decision by the Senate Judiciary Committees Republican leadership not to make the emails public.  The third day of the confirmation hearing again was repeatedly interrupted by protesters hostile to Kavanaugh. The nominee, enduring back-to-back days of lengthy questioning, remained in good humor, making no gaffes that were likely to derail his confirmation in a Senate narrowly controlled by Trumps fellow Republicans, despite the efforts of Democrats opposed to him.  Some liberals have expressed concern Kavanaugh could be a rubber stamp for Trump and protect him from lawsuits and investigations.  Asked by Democratic Senator Cory Booker whether he was picked because of an expectation of loyalty to Trump, Kavanaugh responded: My only loyalty is to the Constitution. Im an independent judge.   Kavanaugh refused to say whether he had the greatest respect for Trump, a phrase Booker said he had used when describing Bush.  Democratic Senator Dick Durbin said Kavanaughs nomination comes at a time when Trump poses a threat to Americas rule of law and is facing an ongoing special counsel investigation. Kavanaugh said his 12 years as a judge demonstrated he was unafraid to invalidate executive power when it violates the law.  Kavanaugh had declined on Wednesday to answer whether a president would have to respond to a courts subpoena, saying he could be asked to rule on the matter. But under questioning by Durbin on the scope of presidential power, Kavanaugh underscored judicial authority.  When a court order requires a president to do something or prohibits a president from doing something under the Constitution or laws of the United States, under our constitutional system, that is the final word, Kavanaugh said.  Kavanaugh, probed again on his views on a 1974 Supreme Court ruling against President Richard Nixon requiring recordings made in the Oval Office to be given to prosecutors, said the case was correctly decided. He called it a moment of judicial independence where I think the court came together in a unanimous decision.   Kavanaugh declined to answer questions on how that case could be applied relating to the investigation by Special Counsel Robert Mueller into potential collusion between Trumps 2016 presidential campaign and Russia.  He also repeated his refusal to comment on whether he would recuse himself if a case involving the Mueller investigation or other issues relating to Trumps conduct came before him.  If confirmed, Kavanaugh is seen as likely to tilt the top U.S. court even further to the right. That prospect worries Democrats and heartens Republicans on volatile issues including abortion, gun rights, gay rights, the death penalty, religious liberty and business regulation.  The committee considering Kavanaughs nomination will hear from outside witnesses on Friday before the hearing wraps up. Republicans hope the full Senate can vote on the nomination close to the time the Supreme Courts new term starts on Oct 1.  In a 2003 email released on Thursday, Kavanaugh suggested striking a line from a draft opinion piece that had stated: It is widely accepted by legal scholars across the board that Roe v. Wade and its progeny are the settled law of the land, saying that the Supreme Court could overturn it.  Asked about that document, Kavanaugh said he suggested the change because he thought the draft language was overstating the thinking of legal scholars at the time. He again declined to say whether the landmark 1973 ruling that legalized abortion nationwide, Roe v. Wade, was correctly decided, although he indicated - as he did on Wednesday - that it was a decision that merited respect as an important precedent of the Supreme Court.  The hearing opened with Democrats complaining that various  documents had not already been made public by the committees Republican leaders. They were released by the committee minutes later.  Booker called the process used by the committee to decide which documents to make public a bit of sham, a characterization rejected by the panels Republican chairman, Chuck Grassley. Booker said he was willing to face possible punishment under Senate rules by releasing the documents himself, although Republicans said they had already agreed to release them.  Trump picked Kavanaugh, 53, to replace Justice Anthony Kennedy, who announced his retirement in June.

But federal appeals courts have issued starkly different rulings about whether border guards in those states can be held to account for shootings across the Mexican border that took the lives of two teenagers. In a dissent this month, a federal judge in California urged the Supreme Court to resolve the clashing rulings. It cannot be, Judge Milan D. Smith Jr. wrote, that guards standing on American soil in Arizona may be sued for cross-border killings but that ones standing in Texas cannot. This is an untenable result, Judge Smith wrote, and will lead to an uneven administration of the rule of law. In the Arizona case, a border guard named Lonnie Swartz, standing on high ground, fired across the border onto a street in Nogales, killing a 16-year-old, Jos Antonio Elena Rodrguez. A divided three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, ruled this month that Jos Antonios mother could sue Mr. Swartz for violating her sons constitutional rights. What was described in her lawsuit, Judge Andrew J. Kleinfeld wrote for the majority, is simple and straightforward murder. He added  and this is what divided the two appeals courts  that Jos Antonios mother should not need congressional permission to sue. The Texas case differed only in the details. There, a border guard named Jesus Mesa Jr. shot a fleeing 15-year-old boy in the head, killing him. The boy, Sergio Hernndez Guereca, had been playing with friends in the dry bed of the Rio Grande and was in Mexico when he was struck. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in New Orleans, said Sergios family could not sue Mr. Mesa. This is not a close case, Judge Edith Jones wrote for the majority in March. Congress could pass a law allowing suits against federal officials by aliens injured abroad, she said. But without such a law, she wrote, federal courts should not interfere with the political branches oversight of national security and foreign affairs. The Supreme Court will soon consider whether to hear the Texas case, Hernandez v. Mesa, which has been before the justices once before. In the Arizona case, Rodriguez v. Swartz, a lawyer for Mr. Swartz filed papers last week indicating that he would seek Supreme Court review. If the Supreme Court agrees to hear one or both of the cases, the families of the boys may face an uphill fight. And there is little reason to think that Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh, President Trumps Supreme Court nominee, would be sympathetic to their arguments. In 2015, Judge Kavanaugh, who sits on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, joined a decision dismissing a lawsuit filed by an American citizen who said he had suffered months of abuse at the hands of American law enforcement officials in Kenya, Somalia and Ethiopia. In a concurring opinion, Judge Kavanaugh said the plaintiff, Amir Meshal, could not sue the officials for violating his constitutional rights because no statute authorized such suits. In 1971, in Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents, the Supreme Court ruled that such congressional authorization was not always needed for people to sue federal officials for violating their constitutional rights. But the court has grown increasingly uneasy about the decision, which concerned the unconstitutional search of a home in Brooklyn, and it has cautioned that the decision should not lightly be extended to new contexts. The Supreme Court itself has extended the Bivens decision only twice, most recently 38 years ago. Judge Kavanaugh wrote that the Bivens decision did not apply in Mr. Meshals case because it involved a national security investigation in a foreign country. If I were a member of Congress, I might vote to enact a new tort cause of action to cover a case like Meshals, he wrote. But as judges, we do not get to make that decision. In the Arizona case, Judge Kleinfeld said that an unprovoked, willful and needless killing warranted extending the Bivens decision to allow a suit from the boys mother. In the Texas case, Judge Jones wrote that only Congress could make that determination, particularly given the national security and diplomatic concerns at play. Both cases are at early stages, and for now judges must accept the version of events offered by the boys families. They must assume, that is, that the guards shot unarmed boys who posed no threat to them. Mr. Swartz, the guard in the Arizona case, also faces criminal charges. In April, a jury in federal court in Tucson found him not guilty of murder but deadlocked on a manslaughter charge. Federal prosecutors have said that they will retry him for manslaughter. In the civil suit against Mr. Swartz, his lawyer, Sean C. Chapman, told the Ninth Circuit that Jos Antonios death was tragic. The morality of Agents Swartzs conduct, however, is not a relevant factor for this courts consideration, Mr. Chapman wrote. Lee Gelernt, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union, which represents Jos Antonios mother, said the Ninth Circuits decision could not have come at a more important time, when this administration is seeking to further militarize the border. The government of Mexico, for its part, urged the Supreme Court to hear the Texas case. It is a priority to Mexico to see that the United States has provided adequate means to hold the agents accountable and to compensate the victims, Mexicos brief said. The United States would expect no less if the situation were reversed and a Mexican government agent had killed a U.S. national.

Kavanaugh and his accuser devolved into a polarizing stalemate on Wednesday as Democrats and Republicans advanced competing narratives to convince voters that the other side has been unfair in the Supreme Court confirmation battle. Christine Blasey Ford, the professor who alleged that Judge Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when they were teenagers, said a Senate hearing set for Monday to hear her allegation would not be fair and Democrats insisted that an F.B.I. investigation take place first. Backed by President Trump, Senate Republicans rejected any F.B.I. inquiry, and said that Monday was her chance to be heard. Dr. Blaseys resistance to appearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Monday seemed to galvanize Republicans and drew wavering Republican senators back into Judge Kavanaughs camp. Barring new information or an agreement by Dr. Blasey to testify after all, Judge Kavanaugh may now have enough momentum to be confirmed as early as next week. Republicans set a committee meeting for Wednesday for a possible vote to move the nomination to the floor. [Read how Dr. Blasey went from the anonymity of academia to the center of a Supreme Court confirmation.] Hanging over the impasse were the midterm elections, now less than seven weeks away. Republicans were determined to confirm Judge Kavanaugh before then, knowing that if Democrats managed to win control of the Senate, it would be exponentially harder to approve any nominees sent by Mr. Trump. Conversely, for Democrats, a delay in voting on Judge Kavanaugh would increase the chances of blocking his confirmation and enhance the influence Democrats would have over who eventually fills the vacant seat. In a statement, Lisa J. Banks, a lawyer for Dr. Blasey, said on Wednesday that her client was still willing to work with the Judiciary Committee, but was not convinced that a hearing featuring just her and Judge Kavanaugh would be adequate. The committees stated plan to move forward with a hearing that has only two witnesses is not a fair or good faith investigation; there are multiple witnesses whose names have appeared publicly and should be included in any proceeding, Ms. Banks said. The rush to a hearing is unnecessary, and contrary to the committee discovering the truth. Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa and the committee chairman, said he was flexible on how to handle the questioning of Dr. Blasey but not on the date. He offered to hold a public hearing or to conduct the interview behind closed doors, whichever she preferred. He said she could be questioned by staff members rather than senators, and that he would even send lawyers to California to interview her, if she liked. But he rejected Dr. Blaseys request that the F.B.I. investigate her charges before any hearing and made clear that he would not postpone it past Monday. It would be a disservice to Dr. Ford, Judge Kavanaugh, this committee and the American people to delay this hearing any further, he wrote in a letter to committee Democrats. [Read what Judge Kavanaughs and Dr. Blaseys supporters are saying about her accusations against him.] The mood at the White House improved on Wednesday, and Mr. Trump referred to Judge Kavanaugh as Justice Kavanaugh three times during a seven-minute exchange with reporters. He again avoided directly attacking Dr. Blasey, but said he found her charges hard to believe. I think its a very unfair thing whats going on, the president said. Still, he seemed to leave open the possibility that he might have to find another nominee if Dr. Blasey proved persuasive. Look, if she shows up and makes a credible showing, that will be very interesting and well have to make a decision, Mr. Trump said. But I can only say this: He is such an outstanding man. Very hard for me to imagine that anything happened. Democrats acknowledged that Republicans seemed to have reassured the members of their conference uneasy over the allegation and could confirm Judge Kavanaugh on the strength of their razor-thin 51-to-49 majority. Clearly, the Senate Republicans have decided to tough it out, and they are worried about one constituency at this point, Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, said in an interview. It is not the American public; it is the six or seven Senate Republicans who objected last week to a hurry-up hearing. They think they have them back in their corner. Still, the emergence of Dr. Blaseys allegation may have cost Republicans the chance of winning support from any of the red-state Democrats they were hoping to enlist. Senator Claire McCaskill, a Democrat facing a competitive re-election in Missouri, announced Wednesday that she will vote against confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh. Ms. McCaskill said she was concerned about the accusation against the judge, but based her decision on campaign finance law. He has revealed his bias against limits on campaign donations, which places him completely out of the mainstream of this nation, she said in a statement. Dr. Blasey, 51, a university professor in Northern California who is also known by her married name, Ford, has accused Judge Kavanaugh, 53, of pinning her to a bed, groping her, trying to remove her clothing and covering her mouth to keep her from screaming during a party in the early 1980s when the two were teenagers in Maryland. Judge Kavanaugh has categorically denied the allegation, and the only other person Dr. Blasey said was in the room has also said he does not remember such an assault and had never seen Judge Kavanaugh behave that way. Another high school friend, Patrick J. Smyth, came forward on Wednesday, saying he was one of two other people Dr. Blasey identified being elsewhere in the house at the time of the alleged assault. In a letter to the Judiciary Committee, Mr. Smyth said he did not remember anything like it. I have no knowledge of the party in question; nor do I have any knowledge of the allegations of improper conduct she has leveled against Brett Kavanaugh, he wrote. He added, I have never witnessed any improper conduct by Brett Kavanaugh towards women. With the conflict over the confirmation and the supercharged allegations taking place so close to the midterms, both sides were deeply anxious about the possible effect and were eager to blame the other. Republicans argued that they have given Dr. Blasey an opportunity to tell her story to the Senate, either in public or in private, while Democrats said the refusal to call in the F.B.I. showed that the presidents party was not really interested in finding the truth. This process has been off the rails for a long time now, but the last 24 hours signal a new low, said Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island. He noted that Dr. Blasey has been harassed and forced to leave her own home since bringing her account to the public. In the face of this, Republicans are jamming her into a take it or leave it kangaroo hearing without even the courtesy of proper investigation of her claims. It is a disgrace. Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican committee member from South Carolina and ally of the presidents who traveled with him on Wednesday to view hurricane damage, said that requiring an F.B.I. investigation before a hearing would not be about finding the truth but delaying the process until after the midterm elections, when Democrats hope to win control of the Senate. It is imperative the Judiciary Committee move forward on the Kavanaugh nomination and a committee vote be taken as soon as possible, Mr. Graham said in a statement. For many Democrats, the insistence on quick action and the charge of obstructionism rang hollow given that Republicans refused to even meet with President Barack Obamas Supreme Court nominee, Judge Merrick B. Garland, in 2016. Judge Garland never received a hearing, and the vacant seat resulting from the death of Justice Antonin Scalia was eventually filled by Mr. Trumps first Supreme Court choice, Neil M. Gorsuch. Three of the Republican senators who had insisted on postponing a committee vote on Judge Kavanaugh originally scheduled for Thursday until hearing from Dr. Blasey have now said she should testify on Monday. I dont think she can reject all those options because otherwise there are these very serious allegations hanging over the head of a nominee who has emphatically denied them, Senator Susan Collins told a radio station in her home state, Maine, on Wednesday. Thats just not a good way for us to end. So I think she needs to come forward, and we need to provide her with any protection she may ask for herself and her family. Ms. Collins noted that Dr. Blasey had secured the services of lawyers and should be prepared for testifying. Theres more than a week between when she made the allegations and the date of the hearing, she said. I just dont understand why the hearing shouldnt go forth. Following the advice of aides, Mr. Trump refrained from any inflammatory comments about the court fight. If she shows up, that would be wonderful, he told reporters before leaving for North Carolina. If she doesnt show up, that would be unfortunate. Id really want to see her, the president said. I really would want to see what she has to say. The allegations against Judge Kavanaugh appeared to diminish his public standing, according to a new Reuters/Ipsos poll. Opposition to his confirmation rose by six percentage points to 36 percent in a survey that began before Dr. Blasey went public and continued through Monday after The Post article. Only 31 percent said they support his confirmation, which would rank him among the lowest nominees if he were eventually confirmed. While Dr. Blasey and Democrats have called for an F.B.I. investigation before a hearing, it is unlikely the bureau would open a criminal investigation of Judge Kavanaugh because Dr. Blaseys accusations do not involve a potential federal crime. Sexual assault would typically be a state crime, and the passage of more than three decades would make any prosecution problematic, according to legal experts. Democrats pointed out on Wednesday that the F.B.I. was asked to investigate Anita F. Hills sexual harassment claims against Clarence Thomas when he was nominated for the Supreme Court in 1991. But Mr. Grassley said that happened when Ms. Hills allegations were still confidential and pointed out that she testified at a hearing only five days after her charges became public, much as Dr. Blasey is being asked to do. The F.B.I. does conduct background checks on Supreme Court nominees and passes along information to officials running the confirmation process, but it does not make judgments on the credibility of the claims, according to Justice Department guidelines. The F.B.I.s role in such matters is to provide information for the use of the decision makers, according to background check guidelines issued in 2010 during the Obama administration. While the F.B.I. should apprise the president or his designated representative when new information surfaces that raises questions about the suitability of an appointee, the F.B.I. does not make any judgment about the credibility or significance of any allegation.

Many conservatives who support Kavanaugh have come forward to argue that men are supposed to see themselves in Kavanaugh, and that men are supposed to share the same interests as Kavanaugh. The demand for male solidarity is a deliberate effort to make men forget that many of them have more in common with victims than with the powerful.

An allegation of sexual assault has thrown the Supreme Court confirmation of Judge Brett Kavanaugh into jeopardy, with the accuser seeking an F.B.I. investigation and Senator John Kennedy, a Louisiana Republican, saying her charge had turned the process into an intergalactic freak show. On The Late Late Show on Tuesday, James Corden said he didnt see things that way. An intergalactic freak show. I like to think that billions of light-years away, an emperor of some alien galaxy is really offended that someone just compared him to Brett Kavanaugh.  JAMES CORDEN Republicans have also been critical of the timing of the misconduct allegation. They were like, This isnt how it works. Youre supposed to find out were creeps after were confirmed.  JAMES CORDEN And Seth Meyers sniped at the Trump administration for standing by Kavanaugh. Following an accusation of sexual assault, Supreme Court justice nominee Brett Kavanaugh visited the White House today for the second day in a row. Its the first time an accused sexual assaulter has gotten into the White House without the Electoral College.  SETH MEYERS A new lawsuit came out, and it claims that female employees were harassed at Del Taco restaurants. Yeah, the lawsuit says the women were exposed to unwanted advances, crude remarks  and food from Del Taco.  CONAN OBRIEN Amazon is planning to introduce up to eight new smart home devices this year, including a voice-controlled microwave oven. Though if you need voice control to use a microwave, maybe youre too drunk to eat whatever youre asking for.  SETH MEYERS Stormy Daniels has written a book about Trump, and an advance copy just came out. And she actually writes about her night with Trump in detail. Which explains why every book comes with a bottle of Pepto-Bismol and a straw.
